<div> Keywords: large language models, reasoning redundancy, attention patterns, clear thinking, structure-aware pruning

Summary: 
The article discusses the issue of redundancy in the reasoning paths of large language models, which can lead to incorrect answers and attention sparsity. By measuring token-level attention scores and using explicit instructions, the researchers developed a method to identify and remove reasoning redundancy. This structure-aware pruning prioritizes removing tokens in low-contributing reasoning chunks to improve performance through clear thinking. The proposed method significantly enhances accuracy on reasoning-intensive benchmarks, especially in challenging mathematical competitions like AIME and AMC. The approach does not require additional training, making it a practical solution for improving reasoning processes in language models. By removing distractions and streamlining the reasoning process, the method demonstrates the potential for enhancing long-form reasoning capabilities in AI systems.

Abstract: Recent large language models have shown promising capabilities in long-form reasoning, following structured chains of thought before arriving at a final answer. However, we observe that these reasoning paths tend to include substantial redundancy; analyzing attention patterns reveals that attention scores are widely scattered, particularly incorrect answers exhibit greater attention sparsity. In this paper, we demonstrate that deliberately removing this redundancy in the reasoning process significantly improves performance through clear thinking, i.e., removing distraction. Specifically, we systematically identify reasoning redundancy by measuring token-level attention scores to a special end-of-thinking token, which is appended to an explicit instruction inserted to conclude each intermediate reasoning step. Furthermore, we propose structure-aware pruning that prioritizes removing tokens in low-contributing reasoning chunks over individual tokens. After evicting redundant tokens, we remove the injected end-of-thinking instruction, then resume the reasoning generation. We demonstrate that our method significantly improves overall accuracy across reasoning-intensive benchmarks without any training involved. In particular, our method shows strong performance on challenging mathematical competition benchmarks such as AIME and AMC, where reasoning redundancy is more prevalent.

Abstract: Modern methods for multi-criteria assessment (MCA), such as Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA), and Multiple Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM), are utilized to appraise a collection of Decision-Making Units (DMUs), also known as alternatives, based on several criteria. These methodologies inherently rely on assumptions and can be influenced by subjective judgment to effectively tackle the complex evaluation challenges in various fields. In real-world scenarios, it is essential to incorporate both quantitative and qualitative criteria as they consist of cardinal and ordinal data. Despite the inherent variability in the criterion values of different alternatives, the homogeneity assumption is often employed, significantly affecting evaluations. To tackle these challenges and determine the most appropriate alternative, we propose a novel MCA approach that combines two Virtual Gap Analysis (VGA) models. The VGA framework, rooted in linear programming, is pivotal in the MCA methodology. This approach improves efficiency and fairness, ensuring that evaluations are both comprehensive and dependable, thus offering a strong and adaptive solution. Two comprehensive numerical examples demonstrate the accuracy and transparency of our proposed method. The goal is to encourage continued advancement and stimulate progress in automated decision systems and decision support systems.

<div> Game Master, tabletop role-playing games, generative AI, Entity-Component, Concordia library

Summary: The article discusses the use of generative AI in multi-actor environments for various purposes, such as social science modeling and interactive narrative. It proposes taking inspiration from tabletop role-playing games where a Game Master (GM) creates the environment and story elements. The Entity-Component architectural pattern is recommended as a flexible scenario definition framework, allowing the GM to be a configurable entity composed of components. This approach separates implementation details handled by engineers, creation of reusable components, and composition and configuration managed by designers. The Concordia library is evolving based on this philosophy, enabling users to configure scenarios tailored to their specific goals. This approach facilitates rapid iteration, modularity maintenance, and scalability. <div>

Abstract: Generative AI can be used in multi-actor environments with purposes ranging from social science modeling to interactive narrative and AI evaluation. Supporting this diversity of use cases -- which we classify as Simulationist, Dramatist, and Evaluationist -- demands a flexible scenario definition framework. We argue here that a good approach is to take inspiration from tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs), where a Game Master (GM) is responsible for the environment and generates all parts of the story not directly determined by the voluntary actions of player characters. We argue that the Entity-Component architectural pattern is useful here. In such a system, the GM is not a hardcoded computer game but is itself a configurable entity, composed of components just like any other actor. By design, the approach allows for a separation between the underlying implementation details handled by an engineer, the creation of reusable components, and their composition and configuration managed by a designer who constructs entities from the components. This separation of concerns is instrumental for achieving rapid iteration, maintaining modularity, and ultimately to ensure scalability. We describe the ongoing evolution of the Concordia library in terms of this philosophy, demonstrating how it allows users to effectively configure scenarios that align with their specific goals.

Abstract: The accelerating loss of biodiversity presents critical challenges for ecological research and conservation strategies. The preservation of biodiversity is paramount for maintaining ecological balance and ensuring the sustainability of ecosystems. However, biodiversity faces numerous threats, including habitat loss, climate change, and the proliferation of invasive species. Addressing these and other ecology-related challenges, both at local and global scales, requires comprehensive monitoring, predictive and conservation planning capabilities. Artificial Intelligence (AI) Foundation Models (FMs) have gained significant momentum in numerous scientific domains by leveraging vast datasets to learn general-purpose representations adaptable to various downstream tasks. This paradigm holds immense promise for biodiversity conservation. In response, we introduce BioAnalyst, the first Foundation Model tailored for biodiversity analysis and conservation planning. BioAnalyst employs a transformer-based architecture, pre-trained on extensive multi-modal datasets encompassing species occurrence records, remote sensing indicators, climate and environmental variables. BioAnalyst is designed for adaptability, allowing for fine-tuning of a range of downstream tasks, such as species distribution modelling, habitat suitability assessments, invasive species detection, and population trend forecasting. We evaluate the model's performance on two downstream use cases, demonstrating its generalisability compared to existing methods, particularly in data-scarce scenarios for two distinct use-cases, establishing a new accuracy baseline for ecological forecasting. By openly releasing BioAnalyst and its fine-tuning workflows to the scientific community, we aim to foster collaborative efforts in biodiversity modelling and advance AI-driven solutions to pressing ecological challenges.

<div> AI tools, software development, productivity, open-source developers, randomized controlled trial <br>
<br>
Summary: In a study on the impact of AI tools on software development, experienced open-source developers were found to have their completion time slowed down by 19% when using early 2025 AI tools. This contradicted both developers' and experts' predictions of a reduction in completion time. The study involved 16 developers with moderate AI experience completing tasks in mature projects. Despite initial forecasts of a 24% reduction in completion time with AI tools, the actual reduction was estimated at 20%. Various factors were evaluated to understand the observed slowdown effect, such as project size, quality standards, and prior developer experience with AI tooling. The result of AI tooling slowing down developers was found to be robust across analyses, suggesting it is not primarily due to experimental design. <div>
arXiv:2507.09089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite widespread adoption, the impact of AI tools on software development in the wild remains understudied. We conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to understand how AI tools at the February-June 2025 frontier affect the productivity of experienced open-source developers. 16 developers with moderate AI experience complete 246 tasks in mature projects on which they have an average of 5 years of prior experience. Each task is randomly assigned to allow or disallow usage of early 2025 AI tools. When AI tools are allowed, developers primarily use Cursor Pro, a popular code editor, and Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet. Before starting tasks, developers forecast that allowing AI will reduce completion time by 24%. After completing the study, developers estimate that allowing AI reduced completion time by 20%. Surprisingly, we find that allowing AI actually increases completion time by 19%--AI tooling slowed developers down. This slowdown also contradicts predictions from experts in economics (39% shorter) and ML (38% shorter). To understand this result, we collect and evaluate evidence for 20 properties of our setting that a priori could contribute to the observed slowdown effect--for example, the size and quality standards of projects, or prior developer experience with AI tooling. Although the influence of experimental artifacts cannot be entirely ruled out, the robustness of the slowdown effect across our analyses suggests it is unlikely to primarily be a function of our experimental design.

<div> Keywords: DeFi, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, market manipulation, decentralized finance, reinforcement learning <br>
Summary: <br>
The article introduces a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework for detecting market manipulation in decentralized finance (DeFi) environments. The framework models the interaction between manipulators and detectors as a dynamic adversarial game, using delayed token price reactions as financial indicators. It includes innovations like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for learning stability, a theory-based reward function for differentiating between price discovery and manipulation noise, and a multi-modal agent pipeline integrating various data sources for decision-making. The framework is part of the Symphony system, a decentralized architecture enabling trust-aware learning and real-time surveillance in DeFi ecosystems. Trained on real-world data, the Hide-and-Shill framework achieves top performance in detection accuracy and attribution. Resources are available on the Hide-and-Shill GitHub repository to promote open research and reproducibility. <br> <div>

Abstract: Decentralized finance (DeFi) has introduced a new era of permissionless financial innovation but also led to unprecedented market manipulation. Without centralized oversight, malicious actors coordinate shilling campaigns and pump-and-dump schemes across various platforms. We propose a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework for decentralized manipulation detection, modeling the interaction between manipulators and detectors as a dynamic adversarial game. This framework identifies suspicious patterns using delayed token price reactions as financial indicators.Our method introduces three innovations: (1) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance learning stability in sparse-reward and partially observable settings; (2) a theory-based reward function inspired by rational expectations and information asymmetry, differentiating price discovery from manipulation noise; and (3) a multi-modal agent pipeline that integrates LLM-based semantic features, social graph signals, and on-chain market data for informed decision-making.The framework is integrated within the Symphony system, a decentralized multi-agent architecture enabling peer-to-peer agent execution and trust-aware learning through distributed logs, supporting chain-verifiable evaluation. Symphony promotes adversarial co-evolution among strategic actors and maintains robust manipulation detection without centralized oracles, enabling real-time surveillance across global DeFi ecosystems.Trained on 100,000 real-world discourse episodes and validated in adversarial simulations, Hide-and-Shill achieves top performance in detection accuracy and causal attribution. This work bridges multi-agent systems with financial surveillance, advancing a new paradigm for decentralized market intelligence. All resources are available at the Hide-and-Shill GitHub repository to promote open research and reproducibility.

Abstract: LLM-based coding agents are rapidly being deployed in software development, yet their security implications remain poorly understood. These agents, while capable of accelerating software development, may inadvertently introduce insecure practices. We conducted the first systematic security evaluation of autonomous coding agents, analyzing over 12,000 actions across five state-of-the-art models (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude variants) on 93 real-world software setup tasks. Our findings reveal significant security concerns: 21% of agent trajectories contained insecure actions, with models showing substantial variation in security behavior. We developed a high-precision detection system that identified four major vulnerability categories, with information exposure (CWE-200) being the most prevalent one. We also evaluated mitigation strategies including feedback mechanisms and security reminders with various effectiveness between models. GPT-4.1 demonstrated exceptional security awareness with 96.8% mitigation success. Our work provides the first comprehensive framework for evaluating coding agent security and highlights the need for security-aware design of next generation LLM-based coding agents.

These events are not presented as inevitable, but as possibilities that we can work to avoid.

Summary: 
EduFlow introduces the EduPRM framework for educational scientific reasoning, addressing limitations of MLLMs by improving scientific reasoning patterns, global coherence, and self-correction abilities. EduPRM is trained using multiple supervision sources, enabling dynamic adaptation and iterative refinement during inference. EduMCTS, a domain-adapted search framework, leverages EduPRM feedback to guide reasoning trajectories, improving search quality. The EduMCTS-160K dataset is constructed, enhancing reasoning consistency and coherence. Overall, EduFlow enhances reasoning performance in educational contexts, providing a comprehensive pipeline for educational scientific reasoning. Code, data, and models will be made available for further research. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still perform poorly on scientific tasks, particularly those requiring multi-step and interpretable reasoning. Their limitations include insufficient scientific reasoning patterns, lack of global coherence in multi-step inference, and the absence of reflective self-correction, making them unreliable in structured scientific contexts. We introduce EduFlow, the first end-to-end framework that covers the full pipeline of educational scientific reasoning, including data selection, MCTS-based trajectory construction, model training, and output optimization. At its core is EduPRM, a process-aware reward model that critiques reasoning steps with tags and justifications. EduPRM is trained via curriculum learning on three complementary supervision sources: MCTS-guided trajectories, error-injected critiques, and teacher-student dialogues, enabling dynamic adaptation to multi-stage problem solving and iterative refinement during inference. We further propose EduMCTS, a domain-adapted search framework that introduces bootstrapping actions specifically designed for educational reasoning, such as a self-reflection mechanism that promotes reflective error correction. It further leverages EduPRM's fine-grained feedback to guide the search toward higher-quality reasoning trajectories. By applying self-consistency and rejection sampling, we constructed EduMCTS-160K, a large-scale dataset of educational reasoning trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EduFlow enhances reasoning consistency and coherence. Code, data, and models will be released.

The paper discusses the importance of explainability and interpretability in artificial intelligence systems, particularly in the context of large language models and generative AI. It explores the concept of transferable and interpretable neurosymbolic AI systems, focusing on Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems that query knowledge sources in response to natural language prompts. The study evaluates how different knowledge representations and complexities impact an AI agent querying a triplestore, finding that both approaches have significant effects.

Abstract: Explainability and interpretability are cornerstones of frontier and next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) systems. This is especially true in recent systems, such as large language models (LLMs), and more broadly, generative AI. On the other hand, adaptability to new domains, contexts, or scenarios is also an important aspect for a successful system. As such, we are particularly interested in how we can merge these two efforts, that is, investigating the design of transferable and interpretable neurosymbolic AI systems. Specifically, we focus on a class of systems referred to as ''Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation'' systems, which actively select, interpret, and query knowledge sources in response to natural language prompts. In this paper, we systematically evaluate how different conceptualizations and representations of knowledge, particularly the structure and complexity, impact an AI agent (in this case, an LLM) in effectively querying a triplestore. We report our results, which show that there are impacts from both approaches, and we discuss their impact and implications.

Summary: 
The article introduces the framework of LLM-Stackelberg games, a model that integrates large language models (LLMs) into strategic interactions between a leader and a follower. It departs from classical assumptions, allowing agents to reason through structured prompts, generate probabilistic behaviors with LLMs, and adapt strategies through cognition. Two equilibrium concepts are defined: reasoning and behavioral equilibrium, aligning internal reasoning with observable behavior, and conjectural reasoning equilibrium, accounting for epistemic uncertainty. The framework is illustrated through a spear phishing case study, showcasing the cognitive complexity and adversarial potential of LLM-mediated interactions. LLM-Stackelberg games are shown to be effective in modeling decision-making in domains like cybersecurity, misinformation, and recommendation systems.

Abstract: We introduce the framework of LLM-Stackelberg games, a class of sequential decision-making models that integrate large language models (LLMs) into strategic interactions between a leader and a follower. Departing from classical Stackelberg assumptions of complete information and rational agents, our formulation allows each agent to reason through structured prompts, generate probabilistic behaviors via LLMs, and adapt their strategies through internal cognition and belief updates. We define two equilibrium concepts: reasoning and behavioral equilibrium, which aligns an agent's internal prompt-based reasoning with observable behavior, and conjectural reasoning equilibrium, which accounts for epistemic uncertainty through parameterized models over an opponent's response. These layered constructs capture bounded rationality, asymmetric information, and meta-cognitive adaptation. We illustrate the framework through a spearphishing case study, where a sender and a recipient engage in a deception game using structured reasoning prompts. This example highlights the cognitive richness and adversarial potential of LLM-mediated interactions. Our results show that LLM-Stackelberg games provide a powerful paradigm for modeling decision-making in domains such as cybersecurity, misinformation, and recommendation systems.

Summary: 
The article discusses the limitations of current reactive approaches in multi-agent reinforcement learning and proposes a shift towards proactive intelligence using generative AI. It argues for reconceptualizing agents as generative models capable of predicting future interactions and making anticipatory decisions. By leveraging generative AI's capabilities, agents can model environment evolution, predict other agents' behaviors, generate coordinated action sequences, and engage in strategic reasoning. This proactive approach enables seamless coordination, dynamic adaptation, and enhanced communication, leading to emergent collective behaviors and collaborative intelligence. The paradigm shift has implications for autonomous systems, robotics, and human-AI collaboration, offering solutions to coordination challenges that traditional reactive frameworks struggle to address.<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.09495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning faces fundamental challenges that conventional approaches have failed to overcome: exponentially growing joint action spaces, non-stationary environments where simultaneous learning creates moving targets, and partial observability that constrains coordination. Current methods remain reactive, employing stimulus-response mechanisms that fail when facing novel scenarios. We argue for a transformative paradigm shift from reactive to proactive multi-agent intelligence through generative AI-based reinforcement learning. This position advocates reconceptualizing agents not as isolated policy optimizers, but as sophisticated generative models capable of synthesizing complex multi-agent dynamics and making anticipatory decisions based on predictive understanding of future interactions. Rather than responding to immediate observations, generative-RL agents can model environment evolution, predict other agents' behaviors, generate coordinated action sequences, and engage in strategic reasoning accounting for long-term dynamics. This approach leverages pattern recognition and generation capabilities of generative AI to enable proactive decision-making, seamless coordination through enhanced communication, and dynamic adaptation to evolving scenarios. We envision this paradigm shift will unlock unprecedented possibilities for distributed intelligence, moving beyond individual optimization toward emergent collective behaviors representing genuine collaborative intelligence. The implications extend across autonomous systems, robotics, and human-AI collaboration, promising solutions to coordination challenges intractable under traditional reactive frameworks.

Summary: This paper presents Consistency Trajectory Planning (CTP), a novel offline model-based reinforcement learning approach that utilizes the Consistency Trajectory Model (CTM) to streamline trajectory optimization. CTP differs from previous diffusion-based planning methods by enabling rapid single-step trajectory generation without compromising policy quality. Evaluation on the D4RL benchmark demonstrates that CTP consistently outperforms existing diffusion-based planning methods in long-horizon, goal-conditioned tasks. The results show that CTP achieves higher normalized returns while requiring significantly fewer denoising steps. Moreover, CTP achieves comparable performance with a substantial speedup in inference time, showcasing its practicality and effectiveness for high-performance, low-latency offline planning. <div>

Abstract: This paper introduces Consistency Trajectory Planning (CTP), a novel offline model-based reinforcement learning method that leverages the recently proposed Consistency Trajectory Model (CTM) for efficient trajectory optimization. While prior work applying diffusion models to planning has demonstrated strong performance, it often suffers from high computational costs due to iterative sampling procedures. CTP supports fast, single-step trajectory generation without significant degradation in policy quality. We evaluate CTP on the D4RL benchmark and show that it consistently outperforms existing diffusion-based planning methods in long-horizon, goal-conditioned tasks. Notably, CTP achieves higher normalized returns while using significantly fewer denoising steps. In particular, CTP achieves comparable performance with over $120\times$ speedup in inference time, demonstrating its practicality and effectiveness for high-performance, low-latency offline planning.

Summary: <br>
This study introduces a novel framework for training Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) using Metropolis-Hastings (MH) sampling, a Bayesian inference technique, for real-time control in reinforcement learning (RL) tasks. By circumventing the limitations of gradient-based methods, the framework improves performance on control benchmarks such as AcroBot and CartPole. The approach outperforms conventional Deep Q-Learning (DQL) baselines and prior SNN-based RL methods by maximizing accumulated rewards while minimizing network resources and training episodes. The use of MH sampling allows for direct optimization on neuromorphic platforms and enables efficient training of SNNs for dynamical agent control. This work signifies a significant advancement in leveraging SNNs for RL tasks by introducing a novel training approach that addresses the challenges of spike-based communication in neural networks. <br> <div>

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer biologically inspired, energy-efficient alternatives to traditional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for real-time control systems. However, their training presents several challenges, particularly for reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, due to the non-differentiable nature of spike-based communication. In this work, we introduce what is, to our knowledge, the first framework that employs Metropolis-Hastings (MH) sampling, a Bayesian inference technique, to train SNNs for dynamical agent control in RL environments without relying on gradient-based methods. Our approach iteratively proposes and probabilistically accepts network parameter updates based on accumulated reward signals, effectively circumventing the limitations of backpropagation while enabling direct optimization on neuromorphic platforms. We evaluated this framework on two standard control benchmarks: AcroBot and CartPole. The results demonstrate that our MH-based approach outperforms conventional Deep Q-Learning (DQL) baselines and prior SNN-based RL approaches in terms of maximizing the accumulated reward while minimizing network resources and training episodes.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has made remarkable progress in recent years, yet its rapid expansion brings overlooked environmental and ethical challenges. This review explores four critical areas where AI's impact extends beyond performance: energy consumption, electronic waste (e-waste), inequality in compute access, and the hidden energy burden of cybersecurity systems. Drawing from recent studies and institutional reports, the paper highlights systemic issues such as high emissions from model training, rising hardware turnover, global infrastructure disparities, and the energy demands of securing AI. By connecting these concerns, the review contributes to Responsible AI discourse by identifying key research gaps and advocating for sustainable, transparent, and equitable development practices. Ultimately, it argues that AI's progress must align with ethical responsibility and environmental stewardship to ensure a more inclusive and sustainable technological future.

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges in current personal service robot systems and proposes a neurosymbolic framework that combines the strengths of multimodal language models with structured representations provided by ontologies and knowledge graphs. By integrating robot perception data, ontologies, and various multimodal models, the framework aims to generate ontology-compliant knowledge graphs to support interoperability in robotic applications. The study evaluates the performance of different models and integration strategies, finding that GPT-o1 and LLaMA 4 Maverick consistently outperform others. However, the results also highlight the importance of the integration strategy in generating effective ontology-compliant knowledge graphs. This approach offers a novel solution to enhance robots' ability to perceive, understand tasks, and execute context-appropriate actions in a platform-independent manner. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Personal service robots are deployed to support daily living in domestic environments, particularly for elderly and individuals requiring assistance. These robots must perceive complex and dynamic surroundings, understand tasks, and execute context-appropriate actions. However, current systems rely on proprietary, hard-coded solutions tied to specific hardware and software, resulting in siloed implementations that are difficult to adapt and scale across platforms. Ontologies and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a solution to enable interoperability across systems, through structured and standardized representations of knowledge and reasoning. However, symbolic systems such as KGs and ontologies struggle with raw and noisy sensory input. In contrast, multimodal language models are well suited for interpreting input such as images and natural language, but often lack transparency, consistency, and knowledge grounding. In this work, we propose a neurosymbolic framework that combines the perceptual strengths of multimodal language models with the structured representations provided by KGs and ontologies, with the aim of supporting interoperability in robotic applications. Our approach generates ontology-compliant KGs that can inform robot behavior in a platform-independent manner. We evaluated this framework by integrating robot perception data, ontologies, and five multimodal models (three LLaMA and two GPT models), using different modes of neural-symbolic interaction. We assess the consistency and effectiveness of the generated KGs across multiple runs and configurations, and perform statistical analyzes to evaluate performance. Results show that GPT-o1 and LLaMA 4 Maverick consistently outperform other models. However, our findings also indicate that newer models do not guarantee better results, highlighting the critical role of the integration strategy in generating ontology-compliant KGs.

Summary: 
The article introduces an open-source PyTorch-based toolkit for applying stochastic control techniques in modeling interactions between AI systems and multiple agents. It focuses on ensuring fairness and robustness within these systems by incorporating stochastic models of agents' responses. The toolkit allows for the provision of a priori guarantees for the interconnected AI systems, simplifying complex reasoning processes. By utilizing a closed-loop approach, the toolkit addresses fairness and robustness desiderata, offering assurances for the interconnected models. This toolkit streamlines the process of providing fairness guarantees for multi-agent systems, making it more accessible and manageable for practitioners. <div>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems often interact with multiple agents. The regulation of such AI systems often requires that {\em a priori\/} guarantees of fairness and robustness be satisfied. With stochastic models of agents' responses to the outputs of AI systems, such {\em a priori\/} guarantees require non-trivial reasoning about the corresponding stochastic systems. Here, we present an open-source PyTorch-based toolkit for the use of stochastic control techniques in modelling interconnections of AI systems and properties of their repeated uses. It models robustness and fairness desiderata in a closed-loop fashion, and provides {\em a priori\/} guarantees for these interconnections. The PyTorch-based toolkit removes much of the complexity associated with the provision of fairness guarantees for closed-loop models of multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1 have demonstrated impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks like mathematics and programming with long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning sequences (slow-thinking), compared with traditional large language models (fast-thinking). However, these reasoning models also face a huge challenge that generating unnecessarily lengthy and redundant reasoning chains even for trivial questions. This phenomenon leads to a significant waste of inference resources, increases the response time for simple queries, and hinders the practical application of LRMs in real-world products. To this end, it is crucial to shorten lengthy reasoning chains and learn adaptive reasoning between fast and slow thinking based on input difficulty. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent progress in concise and adaptive thinking for efficient reasoning of LRMs, including methodologies, benchmarks, and challenges for future exploration. We hope this survey can help researchers quickly understand the landscape of this field and inspire novel adaptive thinking ideas to facilitate better usage of LRMs.

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.09742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, as AI-driven manufacturing becomes increasingly popular, the volume of data streams requiring real-time monitoring continues to grow. However, due to limited resources, it is impractical to place sensors at every location to detect unexpected shifts. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an optimal sensor placement strategy that enables partial observability of the system while detecting anomalies as quickly as possible. Numerous approaches have been proposed to address this challenge; however, most existing methods consider only variable correlations and neglect a crucial factor: Causality. Moreover, although a few techniques incorporate causal analysis, they rely on interventions-artificially creating anomalies-to identify causal effects, which is impractical and might lead to catastrophic losses. In this paper, we introduce a causality-informed deep Q-network (Causal DQ) approach for partially observable sensor placement in anomaly detection. By integrating causal information at each stage of Q-network training, our method achieves faster convergence and tighter theoretical error bounds. Furthermore, the trained causal-informed Q-network significantly reduces the detection time for anomalies under various settings, demonstrating its effectiveness for sensor placement in large-scale, real-world data streams. Beyond the current implementation, our technique's fundamental insights can be applied to various reinforcement learning problems, opening up new possibilities for real-world causality-informed machine learning methods in engineering applications.

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in natural language understanding but struggle with logical consistency in their output. This study proposes a method to incorporate an LLM into the formal semantics interpretation function of a paraconsistent logic system. Through experiments with factuality datasets, the method demonstrates the feasibility of integrating LLMs for formal reasoning tasks while maintaining the logic's soundness and completeness. This approach introduces a theoretical framework for neuro-symbolic reasoning that utilizes LLM knowledge effectively. The method offers a solution to leverage the broad-coverage parametric knowledge of LLMs while addressing logical inconsistency issues in output generation. By directly integrating LLMs into formal semantics, this study paves the way for improved reasoning capabilities in natural language processing.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, but they exhibit problems with logical consistency in the output they generate. How can we harness LLMs' broad-coverage parametric knowledge in formal reasoning despite their inconsistency? We present a method for directly integrating an LLM into the interpretation function of the formal semantics for a paraconsistent logic. We provide experimental evidence for the feasibility of the method by evaluating the function using datasets created from several short-form factuality benchmarks. Unlike prior work, our method offers a theoretical framework for neuro-symbolic reasoning that leverages an LLM's knowledge while preserving the underlying logic's soundness and completeness properties.

Summary: 
Reasoning-capable language models have shown remarkable performance in complex tasks by generating detailed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces. This study investigates whether a base model can acquire long CoT traces with minimal tuning using examples from a stronger reasoning model. Results demonstrate that lightly fine-tuning a base model with a small number of high-quality CoT examples can significantly improve reasoning capabilities. The study also explores using CoT data from non-reasoning models and human annotators but finds that expert CoT traces outperform these alternatives. Key properties of reasoning data, such as problem difficulty and diversity, play a crucial role in distillation. Despite challenges, the study suggests that human-written CoT data, even in small quantities, can stimulate reasoning behaviors in base models. The human-authored dataset generated in this study is made available for further exploration of small-scale reasoning supervision.

Abstract: Reasoning-capable language models achieve state-of-the-art performance in diverse complex tasks by generating long, explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces. While recent works show that base models can acquire such reasoning traces via reinforcement learning or distillation from stronger models like DeepSeek-R1, previous works demonstrate that even short CoT prompting without fine-tuning is able to improve reasoning. We ask whether long CoT can be induced in a base model using only prompting or minimal tuning. Using just 20 long CoT examples from the reasoning model \texttt{QwQ-32B-Preview}, we lightly fine-tune the base model \texttt{Qwen2.5-32B}. The resulting model outperforms the much larger \texttt{Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct}, showing that a handful of high-quality examples can unlock strong reasoning capabilities. We further explore using CoT data from non-reasoning models and human annotators, enhanced with prompt engineering, multi-pass editing, and structural guidance. However, neither matches the performance of reasoning model traces, suggesting that certain latent qualities of expert CoT are difficult to replicate. We analyze key properties of reasoning data, such as problem difficulty, diversity, and answer length, that influence reasoning distillation. While challenges remain, we are optimistic that carefully curated human-written CoT, even in small quantities, can activate reasoning behaviors in base models. We release our human-authored dataset across refinement stages and invite further investigation into what makes small-scale reasoning supervision so effective.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI) systems combine neural network and classical symbolic AI mechanisms to exploit the complementary strengths of large scale, generalizable learning and robust, verifiable reasoning. Numerous classifications of neurosymbolic AI illustrate how these two components can be integrated in distinctly different ways. In this work, we propose reinterpreting instruction tuned large language models as model grounded symbolic AI systems where natural language serves as the symbolic layer and grounding is achieved through the models internal representation space. Within this framework, we investigate and develop novel learning and reasoning approaches that preserve structural similarities to traditional learning and reasoning paradigms. Preliminary evaluations across axiomatic deductive reasoning procedures of varying complexity provide insights into the effectiveness of our approach in improving learning efficiency and reasoning reliability.

Summary:<br>
Large language models (LLMs) use reinforcement learning to improve their reasoning abilities, but verifying model-generated responses against reference answers is challenging. Rule-based verifiers struggle with complexity, leading to the use of model-based verifiers. VerifyBench addresses this by creating a benchmark with expert-level questions in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. Specialized verifiers have high accuracy but low recall, while general LLMs show better inclusivity but inconsistent precision. The evaluation highlights the trade-offs between different types of verifiers and the limitations in cross-domain generalization. This research provides valuable insights into the challenges in verifying the consistency of model-generated responses and reference answers, critical for the development of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR). <br> <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their reasoning capabilities through feedback. A critical challenge is verifying the consistency of model-generated responses and reference answers, since these responses are often lengthy, diverse, and nuanced. Rule-based verifiers struggle with complexity, prompting the use of model-based verifiers. However, specialized verifiers lack flexibility, while general LLM judges can be inconsistent. Existing research primarily focuses on building better verifiers, yet a systematic evaluation of different types of verifiers' performance across domains remains lacking, severely constraining the reliable development of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR). To address this, we propose VerifyBench--a cross-domain comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating verifiers. We construct 4,000 expert-level questions covering mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. Each question is equipped with reference answers and diverse responses. The reliability of the evaluation is ensured through a rigorous annotation process conducted by a multidisciplinary expert team. We design a four-dimensional experimental framework to comprehensively compare the performance boundaries of specialized verifiers and general LLMs under combined conditions of extracted answers vs. complete responses, and short vs. long outputs. Our evaluation uncovers fundamental trade-offs in verifiers: while specialized verifiers achieve leading accuracy, they exhibit deficiencies in recall; general models show stronger inclusivity but unstable precision. More importantly, we discover verifiers' high sensitivity to input structure and inherent limitations in cross-domain generalization, providing critical insights into the bottlenecks of current verifier technology.

Summary:
The article addresses the challenge of achieving monotonic improvement in heterogeneous multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) by introducing the Optimal Marginal Deterministic Policy Gradient (OMDPG) algorithm. This algorithm resolves the conflict between monotonic improvement and Partial Parameter-sharing (ParPS) by using the Optimal Marginal Q (OMQ) function derived from Q-functions, eliminating sequential policy ratio calculations. The Generalized Q Critic (GQC) is introduced to optimize different Q-value estimations, providing stable baselines for actor updates. Additionally, the Centralized Critic Grouped Actor (CCGA) architecture is implemented to achieve ParPS in local policy networks and accurate global Q-function computation. Experimental results in SMAC and MAMuJoCo environments demonstrate that OMDPG outperforms existing MARL baselines, showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing cooperative performance.

Abstract: In heterogeneous multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), achieving monotonic improvement plays a pivotal role in enhancing performance. The HAPPO algorithm proposes a feasible solution by introducing a sequential update scheme, which requires independent learning with No Parameter-sharing (NoPS). However, heterogeneous MARL generally requires Partial Parameter-sharing (ParPS) based on agent grouping to achieve high cooperative performance. Our experiments prove that directly combining ParPS with the sequential update scheme leads to the policy updating baseline drift problem, thereby failing to achieve improvement. To solve the conflict between monotonic improvement and ParPS, we propose the Optimal Marginal Deterministic Policy Gradient (OMDPG) algorithm. First, we replace the sequentially computed $Q_{\psi}^s(s,a_{1:i})$ with the Optimal Marginal Q (OMQ) function $\phi_{\psi}^*(s,a_{1:i})$ derived from Q-functions. This maintains MAAD's monotonic improvement while eliminating the conflict through optimal joint action sequences instead of sequential policy ratio calculations. Second, we introduce the Generalized Q Critic (GQC) as the critic function, employing pessimistic uncertainty-constrained loss to optimize different Q-value estimations. This provides the required Q-values for OMQ computation and stable baselines for actor updates. Finally, we implement a Centralized Critic Grouped Actor (CCGA) architecture that simultaneously achieves ParPS in local policy networks and accurate global Q-function computation. Experimental results in SMAC and MAMuJoCo environments demonstrate that OMDPG outperforms various state-of-the-art MARL baselines.

<div> intent intentionality promise theory semantic spacetime process coherence latent intentionality 

Summary: 
The article explores the practical meaning of intent in science and technology, drawing on Promise Theory's model of Semantic Spacetime. By using process coherence as a guide, agents can identify themes and concepts in text without extensive language knowledge. A method is proposed to assess the 'intentionality' in data by detecting anomalies and analyzing the work done to create them, separating intended content from ambient context using spacetime coherence. This approach provides a basic interpretation of latent intentionality at low computational cost, suitable even for simple organisms. The level of concept formation depends on the memory capacity of the agent, suggesting a practical way to understand intentionality without relying on complex reasoning or training processes. <div>

Abstract: Since Searle's work deconstructing intent and intentionality in the realm of philosophy, the practical meaning of intent has received little attention in science and technology. Intentionality and context are both central to the scope of Promise Theory's model of Semantic Spacetime, used as an effective Tiny Language Model. One can identify themes and concepts from a text, on a low level (without knowledge of the specific language) by using process coherence as a guide. Any agent process can assess superficially a degree of latent `intentionality' in data by looking for anomalous multi-scale anomalies and assessing the work done to form them. Scale separation can be used to sort parts into `intended' content and `ambient context', using the spacetime coherence as a measure. This offers an elementary but pragmatic interpretation of latent intentionality for very low computational cost, and without reference to extensive training or reasoning capabilities. The process is well within the reach of basic organisms as it does not require large scale artificial probabilistic batch processing. The level of concept formation depends, however, on the memory capacity of the agent.

Abstract: Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning has demonstrated remarkable deep reasoning capabilities in both large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, its reliability is often undermined by the accumulation of errors in intermediate steps. This paper introduces an novel approach to calibrate the CoT reasoning accuracy by leveraging the model's intrinsic veracity encoding. We discover that specific attention head activations reliably reflect the truthfulness of reasoning steps in CoT. Based on this insight, we train a confidence predictor to evaluate the correctness of each reasoning step using these truthfulness-sensitive activations, dynamically selecting the most plausible reasoning path via beam search. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., Few-Shot CoT, Self-Consistency, and Self-Evaluation Guided Beam Search) across the mathematical, symbolic, and commonsense reasoning tasks, exhibiting superior accuracy and reliability in both unimodal and multimodal settings. We further validate the approach on large reasoning models, confirming its applicability to specialized reasoning models. Additionally, we explore the role of the model's self-correction ability in CoT reasoning. This work provides a novel reliability improvement path for CoT reasoning with broad application potential.

Summary:
The paper investigates the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically translate SPARQL queries between popular Knowledge Graph (KG) schemas, focusing on translations between DBpedia and Wikidata, as well as DBLP and OpenAlex. Two benchmarks are created for evaluation, containing queries from QALD-9-Plus aligned to DBpedia-Wikidata and DBLP aligned to OpenAlex. Three LLMs are tested with various prompting strategies, showing varying performance levels. Translations from Wikidata to DBpedia prove more successful than the reverse direction. The study highlights the importance of LLM performance in KG interoperability research and showcases the potential for using these models for SPARQL-to-SPARQL translation tasks.

Abstract: This paper investigates whether state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) can automatically translate SPARQL between popular Knowledge Graph (KG) schemas. We focus on translations between the DBpedia and Wikidata KG, and later on DBLP and OpenAlex KG. This study addresses a notable gap in KG interoperability research by rigorously evaluating LLM performance on SPARQL-to-SPARQL translation. Two benchmarks are assembled, where the first align 100 DBpedia-Wikidata queries from QALD-9-Plus; the second contains 100 DBLP queries aligned to OpenAlex, testing generalizability beyond encyclopaedic KGs. Three open LLMs: Llama-3-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B, and Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407 are selected based on their sizes and architectures and tested with zero-shot, few-shot, and two chain-of-thought variants. Outputs were compared with gold answers, and resulting errors were categorized. We find that the performance varies markedly across models and prompting strategies, and that translations for Wikidata to DBpedia work far better than translations for DBpedia to Wikidata.

<div> gradual semantics, assumption-based argumentation, dialectical strength, bipolar set-based argumentation frameworks, convergence

Summary:
This paper introduces novel gradual semantics for assumption-based argumentation frameworks, offering a fine-grained approach to ascribing dialectical strengths to arguments in structured argumentation. By generalizing existing gradual semantics for quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks, the proposed gradual ABA semantics ensure balance and monotonicity properties. The approach leverages bipolar set-based argumentation frameworks as an abstraction of ABA frameworks to derive dialectical strengths for assumptions. Experimental comparisons with a baseline argument-based approach demonstrate the effectiveness and convergence of the proposed gradual ABA semantics in synthetic ABA frameworks. This advancement fills a gap in the research field by extending gradual semantics to assumption-based argumentation, providing valuable insights for various applications of structured argumentation. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.10076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In computational argumentation, gradual semantics are fine-grained alternatives to extension-based and labelling-based semantics . They ascribe a dialectical strength to (components of) arguments sanctioning their degree of acceptability. Several gradual semantics have been studied for abstract, bipolar and quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs), as well as, to a lesser extent, for some forms of structured argumentation. However, this has not been the case for assumption-based argumentation (ABA), despite it being a popular form of structured argumentation with several applications where gradual semantics could be useful. In this paper, we fill this gap and propose a family of novel gradual semantics for equipping assumptions, which are the core components in ABA frameworks, with dialectical strengths. To do so, we use bipolar set-based argumentation frameworks as an abstraction of (potentially non-flat) ABA frameworks and generalise state-of-the-art modular gradual semantics for QBAFs. We show that our gradual ABA semantics satisfy suitable adaptations of desirable properties of gradual QBAF semantics, such as balance and monotonicity. We also explore an argument-based approach that leverages established QBAF modular semantics directly, and use it as baseline. Finally, we conduct experiments with synthetic ABA frameworks to compare our gradual ABA semantics with its argument-based counterpart and assess convergence.

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly capable and ubiquitous, ensuring the safety of these systems is critical. However, existing safety tools often target different aspects of model safety and cannot provide full assurance in isolation, highlighting a need for integrated and composite methodologies. This paper introduces BlueGlass, a framework designed to facilitate composite AI safety workflows by providing a unified infrastructure enabling the integration and composition of diverse safety tools that operate across model internals and outputs. Furthermore, to demonstrate the utility of this framework, we present three safety-oriented analyses on vision-language models for the task of object detection: (1) distributional evaluation, revealing performance trade-offs and potential failure modes across distributions; (2) probe-based analysis of layer dynamics highlighting shared hierarchical learning via phase transition; and (3) sparse autoencoders identifying interpretable concepts. More broadly, this work contributes foundational infrastructure and findings for building more robust and reliable AI systems.

Summary: 
In this paper, the focus is on application migration in edge-cloud systems, aiming to achieve high Quality of Service (QoS) and cost-effective service delivery. The approach involves utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning and Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to automatically orchestrate migration processes. The research is based on modeling the migration problem as Towers of Hanoi (ToH) problems within a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework. The paper identifies, analyzes, and compares various state-of-the-art AI planning and RL approaches for solving the identified class of problems. A new classification based on the definition of the state space is introduced to enhance the understanding of available techniques for orchestrating application migration in emerging computing continuum environments. This analysis provides insights into the potential of AI and RL methods in addressing complex migration challenges in edge-cloud systems.

Abstract: Application migration in edge-cloud system enables high QoS and cost effective service delivery. However, automatically orchestrating such migration is typically solved with heuristic approaches. Starting from the Markov Decision Process (MDP), in this paper, we identify, analyze and compare selected state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning and Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches for solving the class of edge-cloud application migration problems that can be modeled as Towers of Hanoi (ToH) problems. We introduce a new classification based on state space definition and analyze the compared models also through this lense. The aim is to understand available techniques capable of orchestrating such application migration in emerging computing continuum environments.

<div> Keywords: bias, LLMs, debiasing, metacognition, prompt

Summary: 
- The article discusses the ongoing challenge of identifying bias in Language Model Models (LLMs) and the need for general strategies for debiasing that can outlive current models.
- Strategies developed for debiasing human decision-making, particularly through metacognitive prompts, show promise in addressing biases in LLMs.
- The prompt "could you be wrong?" is highlighted as a particularly effective intervention in prompting LLMs to produce additional information, including biases, errors, contradictions, and alternative perspectives.
- The metacognitive prompt helps align the interpretations of LLMs and users, leading to cogent metacognitive reflections and corrections to errors or incomplete information.
- The article argues that leveraging insights from human psychology in prompt engineering can lead to meaningful improvements in addressing biases in LLMs. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.10124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying bias in LLMs is ongoing. Because they are still in development, what is true today may be false tomorrow. We therefore need general strategies for debiasing that will outlive current models. Strategies developed for debiasing human decision making offer one promising approach as they incorporate an LLM-style prompt intervention designed to bring latent knowledge into awareness during decision making. LLMs trained on vast amounts of information contain information about potential biases, counter-arguments, and contradictory evidence, but that information may only be brought to bear if prompted. Metacognitive prompts developed in the human decision making literature are designed to achieve this, and as I demonstrate here, they show promise with LLMs. The prompt I focus on here is "could you be wrong?" Following an LLM response, this prompt leads LLMs to produce additional information, including why they answered as they did, errors, biases, contradictory evidence, and alternatives, none of which were apparent in their initial response. Indeed, this metaknowledge often reveals that how LLMs and users interpret prompts are not aligned. Here I demonstrate this prompt using a set of questions taken from recent articles about LLM biases, including implicit discriminatory biases and failures of metacognition. "Could you be wrong" prompts the LLM to identify its own biases and produce cogent metacognitive reflection. I also present another example involving convincing but incomplete information, which is readily corrected by the metacognitive prompt. In sum, this work argues that human psychology offers a new avenue for prompt engineering, leveraging a long history of effective prompt-based improvements to human decision making.

Summary:
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) play a crucial role in public safety, particularly in wildfire monitoring to detect fires early and minimize environmental damage. This study focuses on optimizing sensor transmission scheduling and velocity in UAV-Assisted Wildfire Monitoring (UAWM) systems to reduce the Age of Information (AoI) from outdated sensor data. A new online Flight Resource Allocation scheme based on LLM-Enabled In-Context Learning (FRSICL) is proposed to efficiently optimize the UAV's flight control and data collection schedule in real-time along its trajectory. Unlike Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), FRSICL uses natural language task descriptions and real-time feedback for dynamic decision-making without the need for extensive retraining. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of FRSICL compared to existing baselines like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Nearest-Neighbor methods. The FRSICL approach shows promise for enhancing UAV operations in time-sensitive applications like wildfire monitoring. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are vital for public safety, particularly in wildfire monitoring, where early detection minimizes environmental impact. In UAV-Assisted Wildfire Monitoring (UAWM) systems, joint optimization of sensor transmission scheduling and velocity is critical for minimizing Age of Information (AoI) from stale sensor data. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been used for such optimization; however, its limitations such as low sampling efficiency, simulation-to-reality gaps, and complex training render it unsuitable for time-critical applications like wildfire monitoring. This paper introduces a new online Flight Resource Allocation scheme based on LLM-Enabled In-Context Learning (FRSICL) to jointly optimize the UAV's flight control and data collection schedule along the trajectory in real time, thereby asymptotically minimizing the average AoI across ground sensors. In contrast to DRL, FRSICL generates data collection schedules and controls velocity using natural language task descriptions and feedback from the environment, enabling dynamic decision-making without extensive retraining. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed FRSICL compared to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Nearest-Neighbor baselines.

Summary: 
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown effectiveness in coordinating multiple agents but faces challenges in real-world multi-agent systems (MAS) due to dynamic environments. The concept of adaptability is introduced to evaluate the reliability of MARL algorithms under shifting conditions. A framework comprising learning adaptability, policy adaptability, and scenario-driven adaptability is proposed. This perspective aims to support more principled assessments of MARL performance beyond benchmarks and develop algorithms suitable for dynamic, real-world MAS deployment. <div>

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown clear effectiveness in coordinating multiple agents across simulated benchmarks and constrained scenarios. However, its deployment in real-world multi-agent systems (MAS) remains limited, primarily due to the complex and dynamic nature of such environments. These challenges arise from multiple interacting sources of variability, including fluctuating agent populations, evolving task goals, and inconsistent execution conditions. Together, these factors demand that MARL algorithms remain effective under continuously changing system configurations and operational demands. To better capture and assess this capacity for adjustment, we introduce the concept of \textit{adaptability} as a unified and practically grounded lens through which to evaluate the reliability of MARL algorithms under shifting conditions, broadly referring to any changes in the environment dynamics that may occur during learning or execution. Centred on the notion of adaptability, we propose a structured framework comprising three key dimensions: learning adaptability, policy adaptability, and scenario-driven adaptability. By adopting this adaptability perspective, we aim to support more principled assessments of MARL performance beyond narrowly defined benchmarks. Ultimately, this survey contributes to the development of algorithms that are better suited for deployment in dynamic, real-world multi-agent systems.

Summary:
AI has made significant advances in nutrition through automatic dietary assessment systems. However, these systems often overlook important factors like ingredient substitutions that affect nutritional content and individual dietary needs. To address this gap in Switzerland, the Swiss Food Knowledge Graph (SwissFKG) integrates recipes, ingredients, substitutions, nutrient data, restrictions, and guidelines in one graph. Using a LLM-powered enrichment pipeline, the graph is populated with nutritional information. The SwissFKG provides detailed ingredient-level information, allergen data, and aligns with nutritional guidelines. An application using the graph showcases how LLMs can answer user-specific nutrition queries. Pairing evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the LLM-embedding approach. This work sets the foundation for advanced dietary assessment tools that consider visual, contextual, and cultural aspects of eating.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: AI has driven significant progress in the nutrition field, especially through multimedia-based automatic dietary assessment. However, existing automatic dietary assessment systems often overlook critical non-visual factors, such as recipe-specific ingredient substitutions that can significantly alter nutritional content, and rarely account for individual dietary needs, including allergies, restrictions, cultural practices, and personal preferences. In Switzerland, while food-related information is available, it remains fragmented, and no centralized repository currently integrates all relevant nutrition-related aspects within a Swiss context. To bridge this divide, we introduce the Swiss Food Knowledge Graph (SwissFKG), the first resource, to our best knowledge, to unite recipes, ingredients, and their substitutions with nutrient data, dietary restrictions, allergen information, and national nutrition guidelines under one graph. We establish a LLM-powered enrichment pipeline for populating the graph, whereby we further present the first benchmark of four off-the-shelf (<70 B parameter) LLMs for food knowledge augmentation. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively enrich the graph with relevant nutritional information. Our SwissFKG goes beyond recipe recommendations by offering ingredient-level information such as allergen and dietary restriction information, and guidance aligned with nutritional guidelines. Moreover, we implement a Graph-RAG application to showcase how the SwissFKG's rich natural-language data structure can help LLM answer user-specific nutrition queries, and we evaluate LLM-embedding pairings by comparing user-query responses against predefined expected answers. As such, our work lays the foundation for the next generation of dietary assessment tools that blend visual, contextual, and cultural dimensions of eating.

<div> Keywords: Transformer architecture, reinforcement learning, offline RL, Decision Transformer, Behavior Cloning

Summary: 
In recent years, the Transformer architecture has been applied to reinforcement learning, with Decision Transformer (DT) gaining attention for its ability to frame return-conditioned policy learning. However, a recent comparison study found that MLP-based Filtered Behavior Cloning (FBC) outperformed DT in sparse-reward environments on robotic manipulation and locomotion tasks. FBC filters out low-performing trajectories from the training data and then applies ordinary behavior cloning, achieving competitive or superior performance with fewer training data and higher computational efficiency. This challenges the belief that DT is always preferable, suggesting that it may not be the best choice for sparse-reward or dense-reward environments. The results raise the question of when DT is truly preferable in reinforcement learning scenarios. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.10174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, extensive work has explored the application of the Transformer architecture to reinforcement learning problems. Among these, Decision Transformer (DT) has gained particular attention in the context of offline reinforcement learning due to its ability to frame return-conditioned policy learning as a sequence modeling task. Most recently, Bhargava et al. (2024) provided a systematic comparison of DT with more conventional MLP-based offline RL algorithms, including Behavior Cloning (BC) and Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), and claimed that DT exhibits superior performance in sparse-reward and low-quality data settings.
  In this paper, through experimentation on robotic manipulation tasks (Robomimic) and locomotion benchmarks (D4RL), we show that MLP-based Filtered Behavior Cloning (FBC) achieves competitive or superior performance compared to DT in sparse-reward environments. FBC simply filters out low-performing trajectories from the dataset and then performs ordinary behavior cloning on the filtered dataset. FBC is not only very straightforward, but it also requires less training data and is computationally more efficient. The results therefore suggest that DT is not preferable for sparse-reward environments. From prior work, arguably, DT is also not preferable for dense-reward environments. Thus, we pose the question: Is DT ever preferable?

Summary: Research in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for data analysis faces challenges due to contradictions and lack of design recommendations.

Abstract: Research into explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for data analysis tasks suffer from a large number of contradictions and lack of concrete design recommendations stemming from gaps in understanding the tasks that require AI assistance. In this paper, we drew on multiple fields such as visual analytics, cognition, and dashboard design to propose a method for categorising and comparing XAI studies under three dimensions: what, why, and who. We identified the main problems as: inadequate descriptions of tasks, context-free studies, and insufficient testing with target users. We propose that studies should specifically report on their users' domain, AI, and data analysis expertise to illustrate the generalisability of their findings. We also propose study guidelines for designing and reporting XAI tasks to improve the XAI community's ability to parse the rapidly growing field. We hope that our contribution can help researchers and designers better identify which studies are most relevant to their work, what gaps exist in the research, and how to handle contradictory results regarding XAI design.

Abstract: Tables are fundamental in domains such as finance, healthcare, and public administration, yet real-world table tasks often involve noise, structural heterogeneity, and semantic complexity--issues underexplored in existing research that primarily targets clean academic datasets. This survey focuses on LLM-based Table Agents, which aim to automate table-centric workflows by integrating preprocessing, reasoning, and domain adaptation. We define five core competencies--C1: Table Structure Understanding, C2: Table and Query Semantic Understanding, C3: Table Retrieval and Compression, C4: Executable Reasoning with Traceability, and C5: Cross-Domain Generalization--to analyze and compare current approaches. In addition, a detailed examination of the Text-to-SQL Agent reveals a performance gap between academic benchmarks and real-world scenarios, especially for open-source models. Finally, we provide actionable insights to improve the robustness, generalization, and efficiency of LLM-based Table Agents in practical settings.

Summary:<br><br>This paper introduces Instance Space Analysis (ISA) as a new methodology to study the relationship between instance characteristics and metaheuristic performance in the context of the Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). Using data from the DIMACS 12th Implementation Challenge, the authors identified 23 relevant instance characteristics and employed dimensionality reduction and machine learning methods in the PRELIM, SIFTED, and PILOT stages. By creating a two-dimensional projection of the instance space, they were able to understand how the structure of instances influences the behavior of metaheuristics. A key contribution of this work is the projection matrix provided, which simplifies the inclusion of new instances for analysis in the CVRP field. This research contributes to advancing CVRP research by providing a new method for analyzing and understanding the intricate relationships between instance characteristics and metaheuristic performance.

Abstract: This paper seeks to advance CVRP research by addressing the challenge of understanding the nuanced relationships between instance characteristics and metaheuristic (MH) performance. We present Instance Space Analysis (ISA) as a valuable tool that allows for a new perspective on the field. By combining the ISA methodology with a dataset from the DIMACS 12th Implementation Challenge on Vehicle Routing, our research enabled the identification of 23 relevant instance characteristics. Our use of the PRELIM, SIFTED, and PILOT stages, which employ dimensionality reduction and machine learning methods, allowed us to create a two-dimensional projection of the instance space to understand how the structure of instances affect the behavior of MHs. A key contribution of our work is that we provide a projection matrix, which makes it straightforward to incorporate new instances into this analysis and allows for a new method for instance analysis in the CVRP field.

Abstract: School dropout is a serious problem in distance learning, where early detection is crucial for effective intervention and student perseverance. Predicting student dropout using available educational data is a widely researched topic in learning analytics. Our partner's distance learning platform highlights the importance of integrating diverse data sources, including socio-demographic data, behavioral data, and sentiment analysis, to accurately predict dropout risks. In this paper, we introduce a novel model that combines sentiment analysis of student comments using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model with socio-demographic and behavioral data analyzed through Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). We fine-tuned BERT on student comments to capture nuanced sentiments, which were then merged with key features selected using feature importance techniques in XGBoost. Our model was tested on unseen data from the next academic year, achieving an accuracy of 84\%, compared to 82\% for the baseline model. Additionally, the model demonstrated superior performance in other metrics, such as precision and F1-score. The proposed method could be a vital tool in developing personalized strategies to reduce dropout rates and encourage student perseverance

Summary:
This article discusses the importance of transfer learning in adapting neural networks to new tasks when limited data is available in fields such as computational chemistry, immunology, and medical imaging. The study focuses on neural memory to facilitate adaptation on non-stationary distributions with minimal data. Hypernetwork designs, which generate specialized networks, are used to acquire more generalizable priors through Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). The hypernetworks are then applied to 3D scene generation to efficiently learn from a few training scenes, leading to faster text-to-3D generation. Additionally, the framework is extended to perform 3D segmentation on novel scenes with limited data by transferring priors from previously seen scenes. Finally, an existing molecular generative method is repurposed for pre-training to enhance molecular property prediction, addressing challenges in computational immunology.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: The ability to transfer knowledge from prior experiences to novel tasks stands as a pivotal capability of intelligent agents, including both humans and computational models. This principle forms the basis of transfer learning, where large pre-trained neural networks are fine-tuned to adapt to downstream tasks. Transfer learning has demonstrated tremendous success, both in terms of task adaptation speed and performance. However there are several domains where, due to lack of data, training such large pre-trained models or foundational models is not a possibility - computational chemistry, computational immunology, and medical imaging are examples. To address these challenges, our work focuses on designing architectures to enable efficient acquisition of priors when large amounts of data are unavailable. In particular, we demonstrate that we can use neural memory to enable adaptation on non-stationary distributions with only a few samples. Then we demonstrate that our hypernetwork designs (a network that generates another network) can acquire more generalizable priors than standard networks when trained with Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). Subsequently, we apply hypernetworks to 3D scene generation, demonstrating that they can acquire priors efficiently on just a handful of training scenes, thereby leading to faster text-to-3D generation. We then extend our hypernetwork framework to perform 3D segmentation on novel scenes with limited data by efficiently transferring priors from earlier viewed scenes. Finally, we repurpose an existing molecular generative method as a pre-training framework that facilitates improved molecular property prediction, addressing critical challenges in computational immunology

Abstract: Multispectral point cloud (MPC) captures 3D spatial-spectral information from the observed scene, which can be used for scene understanding and has a wide range of applications. However, most of the existing classification methods were extensively tested on indoor datasets, and when applied to outdoor datasets they still face problems including sparse labeled targets, differences in land-covers scales, and long-tailed distributions. To address the above issues, an enhanced classification method based on adaptive multi-scale fusion for MPCs with long-tailed distributions is proposed. In the training set generation stage, a grid-balanced sampling strategy is designed to reliably generate training samples from sparse labeled datasets. In the feature learning stage, a multi-scale feature fusion module is proposed to fuse shallow features of land-covers at different scales, addressing the issue of losing fine features due to scale variations in land-covers. In the classification stage, an adaptive hybrid loss module is devised to utilize multi-classification heads with adaptive weights to balance the learning ability of different classes, improving the classification performance of small classes due to various-scales and long-tailed distributions in land-covers. Experimental results on three MPC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

<div> preference optimization, loss functions, stochastic choice, abstention, non-convex objectives<br>
Summary: <br>
This paper explores the relationship between direct preference optimization (DPO) and two major theories in machine learning: loss functions and stochastic choice. The authors demonstrate that DPO is a specific form of connection between these theories, encompassing all of Savage's losses while also supporting abstention in choice theory and non-convex objectives in ML. This broad perspective allows for the inclusion of extensions to the DPO framework, such as margins and corrections for length, enhancing its applicability to diverse applications. Understanding DPO within this broader theoretical context is crucial given its current popularity and the need to navigate various state-of-the-art variations. By illuminating the general principles behind DPO, the paper offers insight into potential pitfalls and strategies for overcoming them. <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we show that direct preference optimization (DPO) is a very specific form of a connection between two major theories in the ML context of learning from preferences: loss functions (Savage) and stochastic choice (Doignon-Falmagne and Machina). The connection is established for all of Savage's losses and at this level of generality, (i) it includes support for abstention on the choice theory side, (ii) it includes support for non-convex objectives on the ML side, and (iii) it allows to frame for free some notable extensions of the DPO setting, including margins and corrections for length. Getting to understand how DPO operates from a general principled perspective is crucial because of the huge and diverse application landscape of models, because of the current momentum around DPO, but also -- and importantly -- because many state of the art variations on DPO definitely occupy a small region of the map that we cover. It also helps to understand the pitfalls of departing from this map, and figure out workarounds.

All boosting and CNN models achieved accuracies exceeding 93%. Among the investigated models, the CNN with feature reduction emerged as the most efficient, offering a balance of high accuracy, low storage requirements, and rapid inference times on both CPUs and GPUs. Variations of this version, with only up to 597 trainable parameters, demonstrated the best trade-off in terms of deployment feasibility, accuracy, and computational efficiency.

- Current resilience theories focus on network topology and neglect system dynamics.
- An automatic method for resilience theory discovery, learning from AI dismantling strategies, has been proposed.
- The method generates a resilience theory considering both topology and dynamics, highlighting the role of node degree and state correlation.

Abstract: Many complex networks display remarkable resilience under external perturbations, internal failures and environmental changes, yet they can swiftly deteriorate into dysfunction upon the removal of a few keystone nodes. Discovering theories that measure network resilience offers the potential to prevent catastrophic collapses--from species extinctions to financial crise--with profound implications for real-world systems. Current resilience theories address the problem from a single perspective of topology, neglecting the crucial role of system dynamics, due to the intrinsic complexity of the coupling between topology and dynamics which exceeds the capabilities of human analytical methods. Here, we report an automatic method for resilience theory discovery, which learns from how AI solves a complicated network dismantling problem and symbolizes its network attack strategies into theoretical formulas. This proposed self-inductive approach discovers the first resilience theory that accounts for both topology and dynamics, highlighting how the correlation between node degree and state shapes overall network resilience, and offering insights for designing early warning signals of systematic collapses. Additionally, our approach discovers formulas that refine existing well-established resilience theories with over 37.5% improvement in accuracy, significantly advancing human understanding of complex networks with AI.

Summary:
Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) is used to enhance the reliability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) against bit-flip faults by selectively applying it to critical components. This paper introduces an efficient TMR approach that leverages Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) through Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to determine the importance of individual DNN parameters. By utilizing XAI insights, the method identifies and protects the most critical weights, resulting in a significant reliability improvement of over 60% at a bit error rate of 10-4 for the AlexNet model while maintaining a similar overhead to existing techniques. Experimental evaluations on VGG16 and AlexNet models using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in enhancing DNN reliability against bit-flip faults. <br> <div>

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are widely employed in safety-critical domains, where ensuring their reliability is essential. Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) is an effective technique to enhance the reliability of DNNs in the presence of bit-flip faults. In order to handle the significant overhead of TMR, it is applied selectively on the parameters and components with the highest contribution at the model output. Hence, the accuracy of the selection criterion plays the key role on the efficiency of TMR. This paper presents an efficient TMR approach to enhance the reliability of DNNs against bit-flip faults using an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) method. Since XAI can provide valuable insights about the importance of individual neurons and weights in the performance of the network, they can be applied as the selection metric in TMR techniques. The proposed method utilizes a low-cost, gradient-based XAI technique known as Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to calculate importance scores for DNN parameters. These scores are then used to enhance the reliability of the model, with the most critical weights being protected by TMR. The proposed approach is evaluated on two DNN models, VGG16 and AlexNet, using datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR-10. The results demonstrate that the method can protect the AlexNet model at a bit error rate of 10-4, achieving over 60% reliability improvement while maintaining the same overhead as state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is one of the most widely used techniques for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). By introducing a small number of trainable low-rank weight matrices, LoRA substantially reduces the number of parameters that need to be updated, offering significant advantages in memory consumption and computational efficiency compared to full fine-tuning. However, we observed that LoRA does not consistently provide speed improvements across all model architectures and training setups. Motivated by this inconsistency, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of LoRA's performance and investigate the underlying factors limiting its speedup. Based on our findings, we propose several methods for more efficient fine-tuning of LLMs. We empirically evaluate these methods and compare them to LoRA, demonstrating that our approach achieves comparable or superior performance while delivering more consistent training speed improvements. Our work offers valuable insights and practical guidelines for practitioners seeking to optimize LLM fine-tuning under resource constraints.

Abstract: The present work tackles the money laundering detection problem. A new procedure is introduced which exploits structured time series of both qualitative and quantitative data by means of a transformer neural network. The first step of this procedure aims at learning representations of time series through contrastive learning (without any labels). The second step leverages these representations to generate a money laundering scoring of all observations. A two-thresholds approach is then introduced, which ensures a controlled false-positive rate by means of the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure. Experiments confirm that the transformer is able to produce general representations that succeed in exploiting money laundering patterns with minimal supervision from domain experts. It also illustrates the higher ability of the new procedure for detecting nonfraudsters as well as fraudsters, while keeping the false positive rate under control. This greatly contrasts with rule-based procedures or the ones based on LSTM architectures.

Abstract: Improving the reasoning capabilities of diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) through reinforcement learning (RL) remains an open problem. The intractability of dLLMs likelihood function necessitates approximating the current, old, and reference policy likelihoods at each policy optimization step. This reliance introduces additional computational overhead and lead to potentially large bias -- particularly when approximation errors occur in the denominator of policy ratios used for importance sampling. To mitigate these issues, we introduce $\mathtt{wd1}$, a novel policy optimization approach that reformulates the objective as a weighted likelihood, requiring only a single approximation for the current parametrized policy likelihood. Experiments on widely used reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that $\mathtt{wd1}$, without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or any supervised data, outperforms existing RL methods for dLLMs, achieving up to 16% higher accuracy. $\mathtt{wd1}$ delivers additional computational gains, including reduced training time and fewer function evaluations (NFEs) per gradient step. These findings, combined with the simplicity of method's implementation and R1-Zero-like training (no SFT), position $\mathtt{wd1}$ as a more effective and efficient method for applying RL to dLLMs reasoning.

Abstract: Lewy Body Disease (LBD) is a common yet understudied form of dementia that imposes a significant burden on public health. It shares clinical similarities with Alzheimer's disease (AD), as both progress through stages of normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia. A major obstacle in LBD diagnosis is data scarcity, which limits the effectiveness of deep learning. In contrast, AD datasets are more abundant, offering potential for knowledge transfer. However, LBD and AD data are typically collected from different sites using different machines and protocols, resulting in a distinct domain shift. To effectively leverage AD data while mitigating domain shift, we propose a Transferability Aware Transformer (TAT) that adapts knowledge from AD to enhance LBD diagnosis. Our method utilizes structural connectivity (SC) derived from structural MRI as training data. Built on the attention mechanism, TAT adaptively assigns greater weights to disease-transferable features while suppressing domain-specific ones, thereby reducing domain shift and improving diagnostic accuracy with limited LBD data. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of TAT. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore domain adaptation from AD to LBD under conditions of data scarcity and domain shift, providing a promising framework for domain-adaptive diagnosis of rare diseases.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) is a promising approach for automatically designing neural network architectures. However, the architecture estimation of NAS is computationally expensive and time-consuming because of training multiple architectures from scratch. Although existing zero-shot NAS methods use training-free proxies to accelerate the architecture estimation, their effectiveness, stability, and generality are still lacking. We present a novel training-free estimation proxy called weighted response correlation (WRCor). WRCor utilizes correlation coefficient matrices of responses across different input samples to calculate the proxy scores of estimated architectures, which can measure their expressivity and generalizability. Experimental results on proxy evaluation demonstrate that WRCor and its voting proxies are more efficient estimation strategies than existing proxies. We also apply them with different search strategies in architecture search. Experimental results on architecture search show that our zero-shot NAS algorithm outperforms most existing NAS algorithms in different search spaces. Our NAS algorithm can discover an architecture with a 22.1% test error on the ImageNet-1k dataset within 4 GPU hours. All codes are publicly available at https://github.com/kunjing96/ZSNAS-WRCor.git.

<title>Gradients as an Action: Towards Communication-Efficient Federated Recommender Systems via Adaptive Action Sharing</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08842</link>

Abstract: As a promising privacy-aware collaborative model training paradigm, Federated Learning (FL) is becoming popular in the design of distributed recommender systems. However, Federated Recommender Systems (FedRecs) greatly suffer from two major problems: i) extremely high communication overhead due to massive item embeddings involved in recommendation systems, and ii) intolerably low training efficiency caused by the entanglement of both heterogeneous network environments and client devices. Although existing methods attempt to employ various compression techniques to reduce communication overhead, due to the parameter errors introduced by model compression, they inevitably suffer from model performance degradation. To simultaneously address the above problems, this paper presents a communication-efficient FedRec framework named FedRAS, which adopts an action-sharing strategy to cluster the gradients of item embedding into a specific number of model updating actions for communication rather than directly compressing the item embeddings. In this way, the cloud server can use the limited actions from clients to update all the items. Since gradient values are significantly smaller than item embeddings, constraining the directions of gradients (i.e., the action space) introduces smaller errors compared to compressing the entire item embedding matrix into a reduced space. To accommodate heterogeneous devices and network environments, FedRAS incorporates an adaptive clustering mechanism that dynamically adjusts the number of actions. Comprehensive experiments on well-known datasets demonstrate that FedRAS can reduce the size of communication payloads by up to 96.88%, while not sacrificing recommendation performance within various heterogeneous scenarios. We have open-sourced FedRAS at https://github.com/mastlab-T3S/FedRAS.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are becoming an essential tool for learning from graph-structured data, however uniform neighbor sampling and static fanout settings frequently limit GNNs' scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we propose the Dynamic Adaptive Fanout Optimization Sampler (DAFOS), a novel approach that dynamically adjusts the fanout based on model performance and prioritizes important nodes during training. Our approach leverages node scoring based on node degree to focus computational resources on structurally important nodes, incrementing the fanout as the model training progresses. DAFOS also integrates an early stopping mechanism to halt training when performance gains diminish. Experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets, ogbnarxiv, Reddit, and ogbn-products, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves training speed and accuracy compared to a state-of-the-art approach. DAFOS achieves a 3.57x speedup on the ogbn-arxiv dataset and a 12.6x speedup on the Reddit dataset while improving the F1 score from 68.5% to 71.21% on ogbn-arxiv and from 73.78% to 76.88% on the ogbn-products dataset, respectively. These results highlight the potential of DAFOS as an efficient and scalable solution for large-scale GNN training.

<title>Assuring the Safety of Reinforcement Learning Components: AMLAS-RL</title>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of machine learning (ML) has led to its increasing integration into cyber-physical systems (CPS) across diverse domains. While CPS offer powerful capabilities, incorporating ML components introduces significant safety and assurance challenges. Among ML techniques, reinforcement learning (RL) is particularly suited for CPS due to its capacity to handle complex, dynamic environments where explicit models of interaction between system and environment are unavailable or difficult to construct. However, in safety-critical applications, this learning process must not only be effective but demonstrably safe. Safe-RL methods aim to address this by incorporating safety constraints during learning, yet they fall short in providing systematic assurance across the RL lifecycle. The AMLAS methodology offers structured guidance for assuring the safety of supervised learning components, but it does not directly apply to the unique challenges posed by RL. In this paper, we adapt AMLAS to provide a framework for generating assurance arguments for an RL-enabled system through an iterative process; AMLAS-RL. We demonstrate AMLAS-RL using a running example of a wheeled vehicle tasked with reaching a target goal without collision.

Abstract: As archives turn to artificial intelligence to manage growing volumes of digital records, privacy risks inherent in current AI data practices raise critical concerns about data sovereignty and ethical accountability. This paper explores how privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) and Web3 architectures can support archives to preserve control over sensitive content while still being able to make it available for access by researchers. We present Clio-X, a decentralized, privacy-first Web3 digital solution designed to embed PETs into archival workflows and support AI-enabled reference and access. Drawing on a user evaluation of a medium-fidelity prototype, the study reveals both interest in the potential of the solution and significant barriers to adoption related to trust, system opacity, economic concerns, and governance. Using Rogers' Diffusion of Innovation theory, we analyze the sociotechnical dimensions of these barriers and propose a path forward centered on participatory design and decentralized governance through a Clio-X Decentralized Autonomous Organization. By integrating technical safeguards with community-based oversight, Clio-X offers a novel model to ethically deploy AI in cultural heritage contexts.

Abstract: The zero-shot capabilities of foundation models (FMs) for time series forecasting offer promising potentials in conformal prediction, as most of the available data can be allocated to calibration. This study compares the performance of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) with traditional methods, including statistical models and gradient boosting, within a conformal prediction setting. Our findings highlight two key advantages of TSFMs. First, when the volume of data is limited, TSFMs provide more reliable conformalized prediction intervals than classic models, thanks to their superior predictive accuracy. Second, the calibration process is more stable because more data are used for calibration. Morever, the fewer data available, the more pronounced these benefits become, as classic models require a substantial amount of data for effective training. These results underscore the potential of foundation models in improving conformal prediction reliability in time series applications, particularly in data-constrained cases. All the code to reproduce the experiments is available.

Abstract: Location-based vehicular traffic management faces significant challenges in protecting sensitive geographical data while maintaining utility for traffic management and fairness across regions. Existing state-of-the-art solutions often fail to meet the required level of protection against linkage attacks and demographic biases, leading to privacy leakage and inequity in data analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm designed to address the challenges regarding the balance of privacy, utility, and fairness in location-based vehicular traffic management systems. In this context, utility means providing reliable and meaningful traffic information, while fairness ensures that all regions and individuals are treated equitably in data use and decision-making. Employing differential privacy techniques, we enhance data security by integrating query-based data access with iterative shuffling and calibrated noise injection, ensuring that sensitive geographical data remains protected. We ensure adherence to epsilon-differential privacy standards by implementing the Laplace mechanism. We implemented our algorithm on vehicular location-based data from Norway, demonstrating its ability to maintain data utility for traffic management and urban planning while ensuring fair representation of all geographical areas without being overrepresented or underrepresented. Additionally, we have created a heatmap of Norway based on our model, illustrating the privatized and fair representation of the traffic conditions across various cities. Our algorithm provides privacy in vehicular traffic

<title>Next-Generation Travel Demand Modeling with a Generative Framework for Household Activity Coordination</title>

Abstract: Travel demand models are critical tools for planning, policy, and mobility system design. Traditional activity-based models (ABMs), although grounded in behavioral theories, often rely on simplified rules and assumptions, and are costly to develop and difficult to adapt across different regions. This paper presents a learning-based travel demand modeling framework that synthesizes household-coordinated daily activity patterns based on a household's socio-demographic profiles. The whole framework integrates population synthesis, coordinated activity generation, location assignment, and large-scale microscopic traffic simulation into a unified system. It is fully generative, data-driven, scalable, and transferable to other regions. A full-pipeline implementation is conducted in Los Angeles with a 10 million population. Comprehensive validation shows that the model closely replicates real-world mobility patterns and matches the performance of legacy ABMs with significantly reduced modeling cost and greater scalability. With respect to the SCAG ABM benchmark, the origin-destination matrix achieves a cosine similarity of 0.97, and the daily vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in the network yields a 0.006 Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) and a 9.8% mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). When compared to real-world observations from Caltrans PeMS, the evaluation on corridor-level traffic speed and volume reaches a 0.001 JSD and a 6.11% MAPE.

Abstract: In this paper, a novel contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model based semantic communication framework is designed. Compared to standard neural network (e.g.,convolutional neural network) based semantic encoders and decoders that require joint training over a common dataset, our CLIP model based method does not require any training procedures thus enabling a transmitter to extract data meanings of the original data without neural network model training, and the receiver to train a neural network for follow-up task implementation without the communications with the transmitter. Next, we investigate the deployment of the CLIP model based semantic framework over a noisy wireless network. Since the semantic information generated by the CLIP model is susceptible to wireless noise and the spectrum used for semantic information transmission is limited, it is necessary to jointly optimize CLIP model architecture and spectrum resource block (RB) allocation to maximize semantic communication performance while considering wireless noise, the delay and energy used for semantic communication. To achieve this goal, we use a proximal policy optimization (PPO) based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to learn how wireless noise affect the semantic communication performance thus finding optimal CLIP model and RB for each user. Simulation results show that our proposed method improves the convergence rate by up to 40%, and the accumulated reward by 4x compared to soft actor-critic.

Abstract: Function Calling is a crucial technique that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with external systems through APIs. However, the high latency associated with LLM-based Function Calling significantly impacts user experience. This paper presents a novel approach called Oriented Distillation for Inline Acceleration (ODIA) that leverages online user interaction data to accelerate Function Calling. By automatically identifying "simple queries" from production traffic and distilling knowledge from larger models to smaller ones, our method reduces response latency by 45% (expected) and 78% (median) while maintaining accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through real-world deployment in a music application, where the smaller model successfully handles 60% of traffic with negligible accuracy loss. Our method requires minimal human intervention and continuously improves through automated data collection and model updating, making it a practical solution for production environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable generalizability in language comprehension and hold significant potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction in smart homes. Existing LLM-based smart home assistants typically transmit user commands, along with user profiles and home configurations, to remote servers to obtain personalized services. However, users are increasingly concerned about the potential privacy leaks to the remote servers. To address this issue, we develop HomeLLaMA, an on-device assistant for privacy-preserving and personalized smart home serving with a tailored small language model (SLM). HomeLLaMA learns from cloud LLMs to deliver satisfactory responses and enable user-friendly interactions. Once deployed, HomeLLaMA facilitates proactive interactions by continuously updating local SLMs and user profiles. To further enhance user experience while protecting their privacy, we develop PrivShield to offer an optional privacy-preserving LLM-based smart home serving for those users, who are unsatisfied with local responses and willing to send less-sensitive queries to remote servers. For evaluation, we build a comprehensive benchmark DevFinder to assess the service quality. Extensive experiments and user studies (M=100) demonstrate that HomeLLaMA can provide personalized services while significantly enhancing user privacy.

Abstract: The growing availability and use of deepfake technologies increases risks for democratic societies, e.g., for political communication on online platforms. The EU has responded with transparency obligations for providers and deployers of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems and online platforms. This includes marking deepfakes during generation and labeling deepfakes when they are shared. However, the lack of industry and enforcement standards poses an ongoing challenge. Through a multivocal literature review, we summarize methods for marking, detecting, and labeling deepfakes and assess their effectiveness under EU regulation. Our results indicate that individual methods fail to meet regulatory and practical requirements. Therefore, we propose a multi-level strategy combining the strengths of existing methods. To account for the masses of content on online platforms, our multi-level strategy provides scalability and practicality via a simple scoring mechanism. At the same time, it is agnostic to types of deepfake technology and allows for context-specific risk weighting.

Abstract: The integration of large language model (LLM) technology into judicial systems is fundamentally transforming legal practice worldwide. However, this global transformation has revealed an urgent paradox requiring immediate attention. This study introduces the concept of ``consistency-acceptability divergence'' for the first time, referring to the gap between technical consistency and social acceptance. While LLMs achieve high consistency at the technical level, this consistency demonstrates both positive and negative effects. Through comprehensive analysis of recent data on LLM judicial applications from 2023--2025, this study finds that addressing this challenge requires understanding both task and stakeholder dimensions. This study proposes the Dual-Track Deliberative Multi-Role LLM Judicial Governance Framework (DTDMR-LJGF), which enables intelligent task classification and meaningful interaction among diverse stakeholders. This framework offers both theoretical insights and practical guidance for building an LLM judicial ecosystem that balances technical efficiency with social legitimacy.

Abstract: How to enable robots to predict the outcomes of their own motion intentions in three-dimensional space has been a fundamental problem in embodied intelligence. To explore more general spatial imagination capabilities, here we present AirScape, the first world model designed for six-degree-of-freedom aerial agents. AirScape predicts future observation sequences based on current visual inputs and motion intentions. Specifically, we construct an dataset for aerial world model training and testing, which consists of 11k video-intention pairs. This dataset includes first-person-view videos capturing diverse drone actions across a wide range of scenarios, with over 1,000 hours spent annotating the corresponding motion intentions. Then we develop a two-phase training schedule to train a foundation model -- initially devoid of embodied spatial knowledge -- into a world model that is controllable by motion intentions and adheres to physical spatio-temporal constraints.

Abstract: This is the fifth year of the TREC Deep Learning track. As in previous years, we leverage the MS MARCO datasets that made hundreds of thousands of human-annotated training labels available for both passage and document ranking tasks. We mostly repeated last year's design, to get another matching test set, based on the larger, cleaner, less-biased v2 passage and document set, with passage ranking as primary and document ranking as a secondary task (using labels inferred from passage). As we did last year, we sample from MS MARCO queries that were completely held out, unused in corpus construction, unlike the test queries in the first three years. This approach yields a more difficult test with more headroom for improvement. Alongside the usual MS MARCO (human) queries from MS MARCO, this year we generated synthetic queries using a fine-tuned T5 model and using a GPT-4 prompt.
  The new headline result this year is that runs using Large Language Model (LLM) prompting in some way outperformed runs that use the "nnlm" approach, which was the best approach in the previous four years. Since this is the last year of the track, future iterations of prompt-based ranking can happen in other tracks. Human relevance assessments were applied to all query types, not just human MS MARCO queries. Evaluation using synthetic queries gave similar results to human queries, with system ordering agreement of $\tau=0.8487$. However, human effort was needed to select a subset of the synthetic queries that were usable. We did not see clear evidence of bias, where runs using GPT-4 were favored when evaluated using synthetic GPT-4 queries, or where runs using T5 were favored when evaluated on synthetic T5 queries.

Abstract: Safety alignment is critical for LLM-powered systems. While recent LLM-powered guardrail approaches such as LlamaGuard achieve high detection accuracy of unsafe inputs written in English (e.g., ``How to create a bomb?''), they struggle with multilingual unsafe inputs. This limitation leaves LLM systems vulnerable to unsafe and jailbreak prompts written in low-resource languages such as those in Southeast Asia. This paper introduces SEALGuard, a multilingual guardrail designed to improve the safety alignment across diverse languages. It aims to address the multilingual safety alignment gap of existing guardrails and ensure effective filtering of unsafe and jailbreak prompts in LLM-powered systems. We adapt a general-purpose multilingual language model into a multilingual guardrail using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). We construct SEALSBench, a large-scale multilingual safety alignment dataset containing over 260,000 prompts in ten languages, including safe, unsafe, and jailbreak cases. We evaluate SEALGuard against state-of-the-art guardrails such as LlamaGuard on this benchmark. Our findings show that multilingual unsafe and jailbreak prompts substantially degrade the performance of the state-of-the-art LlamaGuard, which experiences a drop in Defense Success Rate (DSR) by 9% and 18%, respectively, compared to its performance on English-only prompts. In contrast, SEALGuard outperforms existing guardrails in detecting multilingual unsafe and jailbreak prompts, improving DSR by 48% over LlamaGuard and achieving the best DSR, precision, and F1-score. Our ablation study further reveals the contributions of adaptation strategies and model size to the overall performance of SEALGuard. SEALGuard advances the safety alignment of LLM systems by introducing an effective multilingual guardrail.

Abstract: Personalized vaccines and T-cell immunotherapies depend critically on identifying peptide-MHC class I (pMHC-I) interactions capable of eliciting potent immune responses. However, current benchmarks and models inherit biases present in mass-spectrometry and binding-assay datasets, limiting discovery of novel peptide ligands. To address this issue, we introduce a structure-guided benchmark of pMHC-I peptides designed using diffusion models conditioned on crystal structure interaction distances. Spanning twenty high-priority HLA alleles, this benchmark is independent of previously characterized peptides yet reproduces canonical anchor residue preferences, indicating structural generalization without experimental dataset bias. Using this resource, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art sequence-based predictors perform poorly at recognizing the binding potential of these structurally stable designs, indicating allele-specific limitations invisible in conventional evaluations. Our geometry-aware design pipeline yields peptides with high predicted structural integrity and higher residue diversity than existing datasets, representing a key resource for unbiased model training and evaluation.

Abstract: We explore the use of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling as a probabilistic last layer approach for deep neural networks (DNNs). While HMC is widely regarded as a gold standard for uncertainty estimation, the computational demands limit its application to large-scale datasets and large DNN architectures. Although the predictions from the sampled DNN parameters can be parallelized, the computational cost still scales linearly with the number of samples (similar to an ensemble). Last layer HMC (LL--HMC) reduces the required computations by restricting the HMC sampling to the final layer of a DNN, making it applicable to more data-intensive scenarios with limited computational resources. In this paper, we compare LL-HMC against five last layer probabilistic deep learning (LL-PDL) methods across three real-world video datasets for driver action and intention. We evaluate the in-distribution classification performance, calibration, and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. Due to the stochastic nature of the probabilistic evaluations, we performed five grid searches for different random seeds to avoid being reliant on a single initialization for the hyperparameter configurations. The results show that LL--HMC achieves competitive in-distribution classification and OOD detection performance. Additional sampled last layer parameters do not improve the classification performance, but can improve the OOD detection. Multiple chains or starting positions did not yield consistent improvements.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence-generated content has become increasingly popular, yet its malicious use, particularly the deepfakes, poses a serious threat to public trust and discourse. While deepfake detection methods achieve high predictive performance, they often exhibit biases across demographic attributes such as ethnicity and gender. In this work, we tackle the challenge of fair deepfake detection, aiming to mitigate these biases while maintaining robust detection capabilities. To this end, we propose a novel post-processing approach, referred to as Fairness-Oriented Final Layer Input Prioritising (Fair-FLIP), that reweights a trained model's final-layer inputs to reduce subgroup disparities, prioritising those with low variability while demoting highly variable ones. Experimental results comparing Fair-FLIP to both the baseline (without fairness-oriented de-biasing) and state-of-the-art approaches show that Fair-FLIP can enhance fairness metrics by up to 30% while maintaining baseline accuracy, with only a negligible reduction of 0.25%.

Abstract: We introduce AMix-1, a powerful protein foundation model built on Bayesian Flow Networks and empowered by a systematic training methodology, encompassing pretraining scaling laws, emergent capability analysis, in-context learning mechanism, and test-time scaling algorithm. To guarantee robust scalability, we establish a predictive scaling law and reveal the progressive emergence of structural understanding via loss perspective, culminating in a strong 1.7-billion model. Building on this foundation, we devise a multiple sequence alignment (MSA)-based in-context learning strategy to unify protein design into a general framework, where AMix-1 recognizes deep evolutionary signals among MSAs and consistently generates structurally and functionally coherent proteins. This framework enables the successful design of a dramatically improved AmeR variant with an up to $50\times$ activity increase over its wild type. Pushing the boundaries of protein engineering, we further empower AMix-1 with an evolutionary test-time scaling algorithm for in silico directed evolution that delivers substantial, scalable performance gains as verification budgets are intensified, laying the groundwork for next-generation lab-in-the-loop protein design.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems have demonstrated remarkable promise for tackling complex tasks by breaking them down into subtasks that are iteratively planned, executed, observed, and refined. Despite their effectiveness, these systems often incur high latency because real-world problems frequently demand multiple iterative cycles of reasoning steps. To address this challenge, we propose M1-Parallel, a framework that concurrently runs multiple multi-agent teams in parallel to uncover distinct solution paths. By leveraging an event-driven communication model with asynchronous messaging, M1-Parallel efficiently capitalizes on the inherent diversity of valid plans to either reduce end-to-end latency or boost task completion rates. Our experiments on complex tasks show that M1-Parallel with early termination achieves up to $2.2\times$ speedup while preserving accuracy, and that M1-Parallel with aggregation yields higher task completion rates. We further investigate strategies aimed at encouraging diverse execution plans but observe no additional performance gains over repeated sampling. Overall, these findings underscore the potential of parallel plan execution for optimizing multi-agent systems for real-world, high-complexity reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Conventional Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches are common in text-based applications. However, they struggle with structured, interconnected datasets like knowledge graphs, where understanding underlying relationships is crucial for accurate retrieval. A common direction in graph-based retrieval employs iterative, rule-based traversal guided by Large Language Models (LLMs). Such existing iterative methods typically combine reasoning with single hop traversal at each step, making them vulnerable to LLM reasoning errors and hallucinations that ultimately hinder the retrieval of relevant information.
  To address these limitations, we propose GraphRunner, a novel graph-based retrieval framework that operates in three distinct stages: planning, verification, and execution. This introduces high-level traversal actions that enable multi-hop exploration in a single step. It also generates a holistic traversal plan, which is verified against the graph structure and pre-defined traversal actions, reducing reasoning errors and detecting hallucinations before execution. GraphRunner significantly reduces LLM reasoning errors and detects hallucinations through validation. Our evaluation using the GRBench dataset shows that GraphRunner consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving 10-50% performance improvements over the strongest baseline while reducing inference cost by 3.0-12.9x and response generation time by 2.5-7.1x, making it significantly more robust and efficient for graph-based retrieval tasks.

Abstract: As cosmological simulations and their associated software become increasingly complex, physicists face the challenge of searching through vast amounts of literature and user manuals to extract simulation parameters from dense academic papers, each using different models and formats. Translating these parameters into executable scripts remains a time-consuming and error-prone process. To improve efficiency in physics research and accelerate the cosmological simulation process, we introduce SimAgents, a multi-agent system designed to automate both parameter configuration from the literature and preliminary analysis for cosmology research. SimAgents is powered by specialized LLM agents capable of physics reasoning, simulation software validation, and tool execution. These agents collaborate through structured communication, ensuring that extracted parameters are physically meaningful, internally consistent, and software-compliant. We also construct a cosmological parameter extraction evaluation dataset by collecting over 40 simulations in published papers from Arxiv and leading journals that cover diverse simulation types. Experiments on the dataset demonstrate a strong performance of SimAgents, highlighting its effectiveness and potential to accelerate scientific research for physicists. Our demonstration video is available at: https://youtu.be/w1zLpm_CaWA. The complete system and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/xwzhang98/SimAgents.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance on a wide range of complex reasoning tasks, yet further gains are often possible by leveraging the complementary strengths of multiple models. While multi-agent frameworks can improve solution quality by leveraging multiple LLMs, existing methods are often computationally expensive, both at training and inference time. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical multi-agent framework that addresses these challenges by training only a single leader LLM to coordinate a team of untrained peer agents. To this end, we propose Multi-agent guided Leader Policy \textbf{O}ptimization (MLPO), a novel approach which trains the leader to evaluate and synthesize agent responses without auxiliary value networks or explicit agent feedback. Leaders trained with MLPO exhibit improved performance not only when interacting with the agent team at inference time, but also enjoy improved performance when deployed in single-agent settings without the team. Empirical results on Big-Bench Hard (BBH), MATH, and MMLU demonstrate that our framework achieves substantial performance improvements over both single-agent and multi-agent baselines. Our results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of training a single, flexible leader for collaborative reasoning in multi-agent LLM systems.

<title>Theory-Informed Improvements to Classifier-Free Guidance for Discrete Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for conditional generation and improving sample quality in continuous diffusion models, and recent works have extended it to discrete diffusion. This paper theoretically analyzes CFG in the context of masked discrete diffusion, focusing on the role of guidance schedules. Our analysis shows that high guidance early in sampling (when inputs are heavily masked) harms generation quality, while late-stage guidance has a larger effect. These findings provide a theoretical explanation for empirical observations in recent studies on guidance schedules. The analysis also reveals an imperfection of the current CFG implementations. These implementations can unintentionally cause imbalanced transitions, such as unmasking too rapidly during the early stages of generation, which degrades the quality of the resulting samples. To address this, we draw insight from the analysis and propose a novel classifier-free guidance mechanism empirically applicable to any discrete diffusion. Intuitively, our method smoothens the transport between the data distribution and the initial (masked/uniform) distribution, which results in improved sample quality. Remarkably, our method is achievable via a simple one-line code change. The efficacy of our method is empirically demonstrated with experiments on ImageNet (masked discrete diffusion) and QM9 (uniform discrete diffusion).

Abstract: Protein-ligand binding affinity prediction is essential for drug discovery and toxicity assessment. While machine learning (ML) promises fast and accurate predictions, its progress is constrained by the availability of reliable data. In contrast, physics-based methods such as absolute binding free energy perturbation (AB-FEP) deliver high accuracy but are computationally prohibitive for high-throughput applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce ToxBench, the first large-scale AB-FEP dataset designed for ML development and focused on a single pharmaceutically critical target, Human Estrogen Receptor Alpha (ER$\alpha$). ToxBench contains 8,770 ER$\alpha$-ligand complex structures with binding free energies computed via AB-FEP with a subset validated against experimental affinities at 1.75 kcal/mol RMSE, along with non-overlapping ligand splits to assess model generalizability. Using ToxBench, we further benchmark state-of-the-art ML methods, and notably, our proposed DualBind model, which employs a dual-loss framework to effectively learn the binding energy function. The benchmark results demonstrate the superior performance of DualBind and the potential of ML to approximate AB-FEP at a fraction of the computational cost.

Abstract: Turbulent fluid flows are among the most computationally demanding problems in science, requiring enormous computational resources that become prohibitive at high flow speeds. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a radically different approach that trains neural networks directly from physical equations rather than data, offering the potential for continuous, mesh-free solutions. Here we show that appropriately designed PINNs can successfully simulate fully turbulent flows in both two and three dimensions, directly learning solutions to the fundamental fluid equations without traditional computational grids or training data. Our approach combines several algorithmic innovations including adaptive network architectures, causal training, and advanced optimization methods to overcome the inherent challenges of learning chaotic dynamics. Through rigorous validation on challenging turbulence problems, we demonstrate that PINNs accurately reproduce key flow statistics including energy spectra, kinetic energy, enstrophy, and Reynolds stresses. Our results demonstrate that neural equation solvers can handle complex chaotic systems, opening new possibilities for continuous turbulence modeling that transcends traditional computational limitations.

Abstract: Scientific modeling faces a core limitation: mechanistic models offer interpretability but collapse under real-world complexity, while machine learning models are flexible but require large labeled datasets, cannot infer unobservable quantities, and operate as black boxes. We introduce Simulation-Grounded Neural Networks (SGNNs), a general framework that uses mechanistic simulations as training data for neural networks. SGNNs are pretrained on synthetic corpora spanning diverse model structures, parameter regimes, stochasticity, and observational artifacts. We evaluated SGNNs across scientific disciplines and modeling tasks, and found that SGNNs achieved state-of-the-art results across settings: for prediction tasks, they nearly tripled COVID-19 forecasting skill versus CDC baselines, reduced chemical yield prediction error by one third, and maintained accuracy in ecological forecasting where task specific models failed. For inference tasks, SGNNs also accurately classified the source of information spread in simulated social networks and enabled supervised learning for unobservable targets, such as estimating COVID-19 transmissibility more accurately than traditional methods even in early outbreaks. Finally, SGNNs enable back-to-simulation attribution, a new form of mechanistic interpretability. Given real world input, SGNNs retrieve simulations based on what the model has learned to see as most similar, revealing which underlying dynamics the model believes are active. This provides process-level insight -- what the model thinks is happening -- not just which features mattered. SGNNs unify scientific theory with deep learning flexibility and unlock a new modeling paradigm -- transforming simulations from rigid, post hoc tools into flexible sources of supervision, enabling robust, interpretable inference even when ground truth is missing.

Abstract: Diffusion models can be improved with additional guidance towards more effective representations of input. Indeed, prior empirical work has already shown that aligning internal representations of the diffusion model with those of pre-trained models improves generation quality. In this paper, we present a systematic framework for incorporating representation guidance into diffusion models. We provide alternative decompositions of denoising models along with their associated training criteria, where the decompositions determine when and how the auxiliary representations are incorporated. Guided by our theoretical insights, we introduce two new strategies for enhancing representation alignment in diffusion models. First, we pair examples with target representations either derived from themselves or arisen from different synthetic modalities, and subsequently learn a joint model over the multimodal pairs. Second, we design an optimal training curriculum that balances representation learning and data generation. Our experiments across image, protein sequence, and molecule generation tasks demonstrate superior performance as well as accelerated training. In particular, on the class-conditional ImageNet $256\times 256$ benchmark, our guidance results in $23.3$ times faster training than the original SiT-XL as well as four times speedup over the state-of-the-art method REPA.

Abstract: Methods: We developed a self-supervised deep learning model that extracts meaningful patterns from multi-modal signals (Electroencephalography (EEG), Electrocardiography (ECG), and respiratory signals). The model was trained on data from 4,398 participants. Projection scores were derived by contrasting embeddings from individuals with and without CVD outcomes. External validation was conducted in an independent cohort with 1,093 participants. The source code is available on https://github.com/miraclehetech/sleep-ssl. Results: The projection scores revealed distinct and clinically meaningful patterns across modalities. ECG-derived features were predictive of both prevalent and incident cardiac conditions, particularly CVD mortality. EEG-derived features were predictive of incident hypertension and CVD mortality. Respiratory signals added complementary predictive value. Combining these projection scores with the Framingham Risk Score consistently improved predictive performance, achieving area under the curve values ranging from 0.607 to 0.965 across different outcomes. Findings were robustly replicated and validated in the external testing cohort. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that the proposed framework can generate individualized CVD risk scores directly from PSG data. The resulting projection scores have the potential to be integrated into clinical practice, enhancing risk assessment and supporting personalized care.

Abstract: Edge inference for large language models (LLM) offers secure, low-latency, and cost-effective inference solutions. We emphasize that an edge accelerator should achieve high area efficiency and minimize external memory access (EMA) during the memory-bound decode stage, while maintaining high energy efficiency during the compute intensive prefill stage. This paper proposes an edge LLM inference accelerator featuring a hybrid systolic array (HSA) architecture that optimizes inference efficiency in both stages. To further reduce EMA, we adopt MXINT4 weight quantization and propose an optimized dataflow tailored for HSA, ensuring negligible dequantization overhead and achieving 100% hardware utilization with minimal accuracy loss under edge DRAM bandwidth constraints. For non-linear operations, we incorporate optimized root mean square normalization (RMSNorm) and rotary position embedding (RoPE) units, reducing their latency, area, and memory access overhead while enabling end-to-end inference on our accelerator. Our solution achieves 247/117 (token/s/mm2) while running a 1.3B LLM on long-input/long-output scenarios, providing >2.45x/13.5x improvement over existing approaches, while maintaining superior energy efficiency in token generation.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) inference systems has yielded significant efficiency improvements. However, our systematic analysis reveals that current evaluation methodologies frequently exhibit fundamental flaws, often manifesting as common evaluation anti-patterns that obscure true performance characteristics and impede scientific progress. Through a comprehensive examination of recent systems, we identify recurring anti-patterns across three key dimensions: Baseline Fairness, Evaluation Setup, and Metric Design. These anti-patterns are uniquely problematic for LLM inference due to its dual-phase nature combining distinct prefill and decode operations, its handling of highly heterogeneous workloads, and its strict temporal requirements for interactive use. We demonstrate how common anti-patterns -- such as inadequate baseline comparisons that conflate engineering effort with algorithmic novelty, workload selections that fail to represent production scenarios, and metric normalizations that hide substantial performance variability like generation stalls-lead to misleading conclusions. To address these challenges, we provide a comprehensive checklist derived from our analysis, establishing a framework for recognizing and avoiding these anti-patterns in favor of robust LLM inference evaluation. To demonstrate the practical application of our framework, we present a case study analyzing speculative decoding, a technique whose bursty, non-uniform token generation is easily misinterpreted when evaluated using approaches characteristic of these anti-patterns. Our work establishes a rigorous foundation for evaluation methodology, enabling meaningful comparisons, ensuring reproducible results, and ultimately accelerating genuine progress in LLM inference systems by moving beyond common anti-patterns to align evaluation with real-world requirements.

Abstract: The pharmaceutical industry faces unprecedented challenges in drug discovery, with traditional approaches struggling to meet modern therapeutic development demands. This paper introduces a novel AI framework, Tippy, that transforms laboratory automation through specialized AI agents operating within the Design-Make-Test-Analyze (DMTA) cycle. Our multi-agent system employs five specialized agents - Supervisor, Molecule, Lab, Analysis, and Report, with Safety Guardrail oversight - each designed to excel in specific phases of the drug discovery pipeline. Tippy represents the first production-ready implementation of specialized AI agents for automating the DMTA cycle, providing a concrete example of how AI can transform laboratory workflows. By leveraging autonomous AI agents that reason, plan, and collaborate, we demonstrate how Tippy accelerates DMTA cycles while maintaining scientific rigor essential for pharmaceutical research. The system shows significant improvements in workflow efficiency, decision-making speed, and cross-disciplinary coordination, offering a new paradigm for AI-assisted drug discovery.

The rise of foundation models (FMs) -- large deep-learning models pretrained on extensive amounts of data serving as a backbone for a wide range of downstream tasks -- offers new avenues for discovering biomarkers, improving diagnosis, and personalizing treatment. This paper presents a comprehensive review of widely adopted integration strategies of multimodal data to assist advance the computational approaches for data-driven discoveries in oncology. We examine emerging trends in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), including methodological frameworks, validation protocols, and open-source resources targeting cancer subtype classification, biomarker discovery, treatment guidance, and outcome prediction. This study also comprehensively covers the shift from traditional ML to FMs for multimodal integration. We present a holistic view of recent FMs advancements and challenges faced during the integration of multi-omics with advanced imaging data. We identify the state-of-the-art FMs, publicly available multi-modal repositories, and advanced tools and methods for data integration. We argue that current state-of-the-art integrative methods provide the essential groundwork for developing the next generation of large-scale, pre-trained models poised to further revolutionize oncology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review to systematically map the transition from conventional ML to advanced FM for multimodal data integration in oncology, while also framing these developments as foundational for the forthcoming era of large-scale AI models in cancer research.

Abstract: Distributed pre-training of large models at scale often imposes heavy memory demands on individual nodes and incurs significant intra-node communication costs. We propose a novel alternative approach that reduces the memory requirements by training small, structured subnetworks of the model on separate workers. Unlike pipelining, our method avoids inter-node activation communication and maintains bandwidth requirements that are comparable to or lower than standard data parallel communication schemes based on all-reduce. We evaluate two subnetwork construction strategies guided by the principle of ensuring uniform representation of each parameter across the distributed training setup. Our results show that the stochastic block dropping technique consistently outperforms the width-wise subnetwork construction previously explored in federated learning. We empirically attribute this superior performance to stronger gradient alignment in subnetworks that retain blocks having skip connections. Preliminary experiments highlight the promise of our approach, achieving a 20-40% reduction in memory usage without any loss in performance.

Abstract: BrainLesion Suite is a versatile toolkit for building modular brain lesion image analysis pipelines in Python. Following Pythonic principles, BrainLesion Suite is designed to provide a 'brainless' development experience, minimizing cognitive effort and streamlining the creation of complex workflows for clinical and scientific practice. At its core is an adaptable preprocessing module that performs co-registration, atlas registration, and optional skull-stripping and defacing on arbitrary multi-modal input images. BrainLesion Suite leverages algorithms from the BraTS challenge to synthesize missing modalities, inpaint lesions, and generate pathology-specific tumor segmentations. BrainLesion Suite also enables quantifying segmentation model performance, with tools such as panoptica to compute lesion-wise metrics. Although BrainLesion Suite was originally developed for image analysis pipelines of brain lesions such as glioma, metastasis, and multiple sclerosis, it can be adapted for other biomedical image analysis applications. The individual BrainLesion Suite packages and tutorials are accessible on GitHub.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used as decision aids. However, users have diverse values and preferences that can affect their decision-making, which requires novel methods for LLM alignment and personalization. Existing LLM comparison tools largely focus on benchmarking tasks, such as knowledge-based question answering. In contrast, our proposed ALIGN system focuses on dynamic personalization of LLM-based decision-makers through prompt-based alignment to a set of fine-grained attributes. Key features of our system include robust configuration management, structured output generation with reasoning, and several algorithm implementations with swappable LLM backbones, enabling different types of analyses. Our user interface enables a qualitative, side-by-side comparison of LLMs and their alignment to various attributes, with a modular backend for easy algorithm integration. Additionally, we perform a quantitative analysis comparing alignment approaches in two different domains: demographic alignment for public opinion surveys and value alignment for medical triage decision-making. The entire ALIGN framework is open source and will enable new research on reliable, responsible, and personalized LLM-based decision-makers.

Abstract: Modern Large Language Model (LLM) agents promise end to end assistance with real-world software tasks, yet existing benchmarks evaluate LLM agents almost exclusively in pre-baked environments where every dependency is pre-installed. To fill this gap, we introduce SetupBench, a 93 instance benchmark that isolates the environment-bootstrap skill: starting from a bare Linux sandbox, an agent must install packages, resolve dependency conflicts, initialize databases, and configure background services. Our tasks span seven language ecosystems, five database engines, and multi-service orchestration scenarios, each accompanies by a natural language problem statement and a deterministic success command. Through evaluation of OpenHands, a state-of-the-art coding agent, we find low success rates across task categories, with particular challenges in repository setup (38.9-57.4%) and local database configuration (20.0-53.3%). Our analysis reveals systematic failure modes including incomplete development tooling installation, hallucinated task constraints, and non-persistent environment modifications that break agent-human collaboration workflows. We identify substantial inefficiencies in agent exploration strategies, with 38-89% of actions being unnecessary compared to optimal human behavior. These findings highlight gaps in current agents' practical environment-bootstrap capabilities. By targeting this critical yet under-evaluated capability, SetupBench provides a rigorous yard-stick for the next generation of software developer agents aiming to solve end to end real-wold tasks.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal extensions (MLLMs) have ushered in remarkable progress in video understanding. However, a fundamental challenge persists: effectively processing and comprehending video content that extends beyond minutes or hours. While recent efforts like Video-XL-2 have demonstrated novel architectural solutions for extreme efficiency, and advancements in positional encoding such as HoPE and VideoRoPE++ aim to improve spatio-temporal understanding over extensive contexts, current state-of-the-art models still encounter significant computational and memory constraints when faced with the sheer volume of visual tokens from lengthy sequences. Furthermore, maintaining temporal coherence, tracking complex events, and preserving fine-grained details over extended periods remain formidable hurdles, despite progress in agentic reasoning systems like Deep Video Discovery. This position paper posits that a logical, albeit ambitious, next frontier for multimedia research is Infinite Video Understanding -- the capability for models to continuously process, understand, and reason about video data of arbitrary, potentially never-ending duration. We argue that framing Infinite Video Understanding as a blue-sky research objective provides a vital north star for the multimedia, and the wider AI, research communities, driving innovation in areas such as streaming architectures, persistent memory mechanisms, hierarchical and adaptive representations, event-centric reasoning, and novel evaluation paradigms. Drawing inspiration from recent work on long/ultra-long video understanding and several closely related fields, we outline the core challenges and key research directions towards achieving this transformative capability.

Abstract: Recent research has focused on applying speech large language model (SLLM) to improve speech emotion recognition (SER). However, the inherently high frame rate in speech modality severely limits the signal processing and understanding capabilities of SLLM. For example, a SLLM with a 4K context window can only process 80 seconds of audio at 50Hz feature sampling rate before reaching its capacity limit. Input token compression methods used in SLLM overlook the continuity and inertia of emotions across multiple conversation turns. This paper proposes a Dynamic Parameter Memory (DPM) mechanism with contextual semantics and sentence-level emotion encoding, enabling processing of unlimited-length audio with limited context windows in SLLM. Specifically, DPM progressively encodes sentence-level information and emotions into a temporary LoRA module during inference to effectively "memorize" the contextual information. We trained an emotion SLLM as a backbone and incorporated our DPM into inference for emotion recognition in conversation (ERC). Experimental results on the IEMOCAP dataset show that DPM significantly improves the emotion recognition capabilities of SLLM when processing long audio sequences, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: This paper investigates the behavior of simulated AI agents (large language models, or LLMs) in auctions, introducing a novel synthetic data-generating process to help facilitate the study and design of auctions. We find that LLMs -- when endowed with chain of thought reasoning capacity -- agree with the experimental literature in auctions across a variety of classic auction formats. In particular, we find that LLM bidders produce results consistent with risk-averse human bidders; that they perform closer to theoretical predictions in obviously strategy-proof auctions; and, that they succumb to the winner's curse in common value settings. On prompting, we find that LLMs are not very sensitive to naive changes in prompts (e.g., language, currency) but can improve dramatically towards theoretical predictions with the right mental model (i.e., the language of Nash deviations). We run 1,000$+$ auctions for less than $\$$400 with GPT-4 models (three orders of magnitude cheaper than modern auction experiments) and develop a framework flexible enough to run auction experiments with any LLM model and a wide range of auction design specifications, facilitating further experimental study by decreasing costs and serving as a proof-of-concept for the use of LLM proxies.

Abstract: Flight delays are a significant challenge in the aviation industry, causing major financial and operational disruptions. To improve passenger experience and reduce revenue loss, flight delay prediction models must be both precise and generalizable across different networks. This paper introduces a novel approach that combines Queue-Theory with a simple attention model, referred to as the Queue-Theory SimAM (QT-SimAM). To validate our model, we used data from the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics, where our proposed QT-SimAM (Bidirectional) model outperformed existing methods with an accuracy of 0.927 and an F1 score of 0.932. To assess transferability, we tested the model on the EUROCONTROL dataset. The results demonstrated strong performance, achieving an accuracy of 0.826 and an F1 score of 0.791. Ultimately, this paper outlines an effective, end-to-end methodology for predicting flight delays. The proposed model's ability to forecast delays with high accuracy across different networks can help reduce passenger anxiety and improve operational decision-making

Abstract: Achieving fast and stable off-policy learning in deep reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging. Most existing methods rely on semi-gradient temporal-difference (TD) methods for their simplicity and efficiency, but are consequently susceptible to divergence. While more principled approaches like Gradient TD (GTD) methods have strong convergence guarantees, they have rarely been used in deep RL. Recent work introduced the Generalized Projected Bellman Error ($\GPBE$), enabling GTD methods to work efficiently with nonlinear function approximation. However, this work is only limited to one-step methods, which are slow at credit assignment and require a large number of samples. In this paper, we extend the $\GPBE$ objective to support multistep credit assignment based on the $\lambda$-return and derive three gradient-based methods that optimize this new objective. We provide both a forward-view formulation compatible with experience replay and a backward-view formulation compatible with streaming algorithms. Finally, we evaluate the proposed algorithms and show that they outperform both PPO and StreamQ in MuJoCo and MinAtar environments, respectively.

Abstract: In decision-making conversations, experts must navigate complex choices and make on-the-spot decisions while engaged in conversation. Although extensive historical data often exists, the real-time nature of these scenarios makes it infeasible for decision-makers to review and leverage relevant information. This raises an interesting question: What if experts could utilize relevant past data in real-time decision-making through insights derived from past data? To explore this, we implemented a conversational user interface, taking doctor-patient interactions as an example use case. Our system continuously listens to the conversation, identifies patient problems and doctor-suggested solutions, and retrieves related data from an embedded dataset, generating concise insights using a pipeline built around a retrieval-based Large Language Model (LLM) agent. We evaluated the prototype by embedding Health Canada datasets into a vector database and conducting simulated studies using sample doctor-patient dialogues, showing effectiveness but also challenges, setting directions for the next steps of our work.

Abstract: Recently, the role of LLM-as-judge in evaluating large language models has gained prominence. However, current judge models suffer from narrow specialization and limited robustness, undermining their capacity for comprehensive evaluations. In this work, we present CompassJudger-2, a novel generalist judge model that overcomes these limitations via a task-driven, multi-domain data curation strategy. Central to our approach is supervising judgment tasks with verifiable rewards, guiding intrinsic critical reasoning through rejection sampling to foster robust, generalizable judgment capabilities. We introduce a refined learning objective with margin policy gradient loss to enhance performance. Empirically, CompassJudger-2 achieves superior results across multiple judge and reward benchmarks, and our 7B model demonstrates competitive judgment accuracy with significantly larger models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3-235B-A22B. Additionally, we propose JudgerBenchV2, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating cross-domain judgment accuracy and rank consistency to standardize judge model evaluation. These contributions advance robust, scalable LLM judgment and establish new performance and evaluation standards.

Abstract: High-quality labeled datasets are crucial for training and evaluating foundation models in software engineering, but creating them is often prohibitively expensive and labor-intensive. We introduce SPICE, a scalable, automated pipeline for labeling SWE-bench-style datasets with annotations for issue clarity, test coverage, and effort estimation. SPICE combines context-aware code navigation, rationale-driven prompting, and multi-pass consensus to produce labels that closely approximate expert annotations. SPICE's design was informed by our own experience and frustration in labeling more than 800 instances from SWE-Gym. SPICE achieves strong agreement with human-labeled SWE-bench Verified data while reducing the cost of labeling 1,000 instances from around $100,000 (manual annotation) to just $5.10. These results demonstrate SPICE's potential to enable cost-effective, large-scale dataset creation for SE-focused FMs. To support the community, we release both SPICE tool and SPICE Bench, a new dataset of 6,802 SPICE-labeled instances curated from 291 open-source projects in SWE-Gym (over 13x larger than SWE-bench Verified).

Abstract: Dexterous intelligence -- the ability to perform complex interactions with multi-fingered hands -- is a pinnacle of human physical intelligence and emergent higher-order cognitive skills. However, contrary to Moravec's paradox, dexterous intelligence in humans appears simple only superficially. Many million years were spent co-evolving the human brain and hands including rich tactile sensing. Achieving human-level dexterity with robotic hands has long been a fundamental goal in robotics and represents a critical milestone toward general embodied intelligence. In this pursuit, computational sensorimotor learning has made significant progress, enabling feats such as arbitrary in-hand object reorientation. However, we observe that achieving higher levels of dexterity requires overcoming very fundamental limitations of computational sensorimotor learning.
  I develop robot learning methods for highly dexterous multi-fingered manipulation by directly addressing these limitations at their root cause. Chiefly, through key studies, this disseration progressively builds an effective framework for reinforcement learning of dexterous multi-fingered manipulation skills. These methods adopt structured exploration, effectively overcoming the limitations of random exploration in reinforcement learning. The insights gained culminate in a highly effective reinforcement learning that incorporates sampling-based planning for direct exploration. Additionally, this thesis explores a new paradigm of using visuo-tactile human demonstrations for dexterity, introducing corresponding imitation learning techniques.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various graph-based tasks (e.g., node classification or link prediction). Despite their triumphs, GNNs still face challenges such as long training and inference times, difficulty in capturing complex relationships, and insufficient feature extraction. To tackle these issues, graph pre-training and graph prompt methods have garnered increasing attention for their ability to leverage large-scale datasets for initial learning and task-specific adaptation, offering potential improvements in GNN performance. However, previous research has overlooked the potential of graph prompts in optimizing models, as well as the impact of both positive and negative graph prompts on model stability and efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework combining graph prompts with weight pruning, called GPAWP, which aims to enhance the performance and efficiency of graph prompts by using fewer of them. We evaluate the importance of graph prompts using an importance assessment function to determine positive and negative weights at different granularities. Through hierarchically structured pruning, we eliminate negative prompt labels, resulting in more parameter-efficient and competitively performing prompts. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of GPAWP, leading to a significant reduction in parameters in node classification tasks.

Abstract: Accurately attributing user visits to specific Points of Interest (POIs) is a foundational task for mobility analytics, personalized services, marketing and urban planning. However, POI attribution remains challenging due to GPS inaccuracies, typically ranging from 2 to 20 meters in real-world settings, and the high spatial density of POIs in urban environments, where multiple venues can coexist within a small radius (e.g., over 50 POIs within a 100-meter radius in dense city centers). Relying on proximity is therefore often insufficient for determining which POI was actually visited. We introduce \textsf{POIFormer}, a novel Transformer-based framework for accurate and efficient POI attribution. Unlike prior approaches that rely on limited spatiotemporal, contextual, or behavioral features, \textsf{POIFormer} jointly models a rich set of signals, including spatial proximity, visit timing and duration, contextual features from POI semantics, and behavioral features from user mobility and aggregated crowd behavior patterns--using the Transformer's self-attention mechanism to jointly model complex interactions across these dimensions. By leveraging the Transformer to model a user's past and future visits (with the current visit masked) and incorporating crowd-level behavioral patterns through pre-computed KDEs, \textsf{POIFormer} enables accurate, efficient attribution in large, noisy mobility datasets. Its architecture supports generalization across diverse data sources and geographic contexts while avoiding reliance on hard-to-access or unavailable data layers, making it practical for real-world deployment. Extensive experiments on real-world mobility datasets demonstrate significant improvements over existing baselines, particularly in challenging real-world settings characterized by spatial noise and dense POI clustering.

Abstract: Health misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly challenged public health efforts globally. This study applies the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) to enhance misinformation detection on social media using a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. The model aims to enhance the detection accuracy and reliability of misinformation classification by integrating ELM-based features such as text readability, sentiment polarity, and heuristic cues (e.g., punctuation frequency). The enhanced model achieved an accuracy of 97.37%, precision of 96.88%, recall of 98.50%, F1-score of 97.41%, and ROC-AUC of 99.50%. A combined model incorporating feature engineering further improved performance, achieving a precision of 98.88%, recall of 99.80%, F1-score of 99.41%, and ROC-AUC of 99.80%. These findings highlight the value of ELM features in improving detection performance, offering valuable contextual information. This study demonstrates the practical application of psychological theories in developing advanced machine learning algorithms to address health misinformation effectively.

Abstract: This work presents OPENXRD, an open-book pipeline designed for crystallography question answering, which integrates textual prompts with concise supporting content generated by GPT-4.5. Instead of using scanned textbooks, which may lead to copyright issues, OPENXRD generates compact, domain-specific references that help smaller models understand key concepts in X-ray diffraction (XRD). We evaluate OPENXRD on a well-defined set of 217 expert-level XRD questions by comparing different vision-language models, including GPT-4 and LLaVA-based frameworks such as Mistral, LLaMA, and QWEN, under both closed-book (without supporting material) and open-book (with supporting material) conditions. Our experimental results show significant accuracy improvements in models that use the GPT-4.5-generated summaries, particularly those with limited prior training in crystallography. OPENXRD uses knowledge from larger models to fill knowledge gaps in crystallography and shows that AI-generated texts can help smaller models reason more effectively in scientific tasks. While the current version of OPENXRD focuses on text-based inputs, we also explore future extensions such as adding real crystal diagrams or diffraction patterns to improve interpretation in specialized materials science contexts. Overall, OPENXRD shows that specialized open-book systems can be useful in materials science and provides a foundation for broader natural language processing (NLP) tools in critical scientific fields.

Abstract: In spinal vertebral mobility disease, accurately extracting and contouring vertebrae is essential for assessing mobility impairments and monitoring variations during flexion-extension movements. Precise vertebral contouring plays a crucial role in surgical planning; however, this process is traditionally performed manually by radiologists or surgeons, making it labour-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to human error. In particular, mobility disease analysis requires the individual contouring of each vertebra, which is both tedious and susceptible to inconsistencies. Automated methods provide a more efficient alternative, enabling vertebra identification, segmentation, and contouring with greater accuracy and reduced time consumption. In this study, we propose a novel U-Net variation designed to accurately segment thoracic vertebrae from anteroposterior view on X-Ray images. Our proposed approach, incorporating a ``sandwich" U-Net structure with dual activation functions, achieves a 4.1\% improvement in Dice score compared to the baseline U-Net model, enhancing segmentation accuracy while ensuring reliable vertebral contour extraction.

<title>Towards Interpretable Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction: A Graph-Based Approach with Molecular and Network-Level Explanations</title>

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) represent a critical challenge in pharmacology, often leading to adverse drug reactions with significant implications for patient safety and healthcare outcomes. While graph-based methods have achieved strong predictive performance, most approaches treat drug pairs independently, overlooking the complex, context-dependent interactions unique to drug pairs. Additionally, these models struggle to integrate biological interaction networks and molecular-level structures to provide meaningful mechanistic insights. In this study, we propose MolecBioNet, a novel graph-based framework that integrates molecular and biomedical knowledge for robust and interpretable DDI prediction. By modeling drug pairs as unified entities, MolecBioNet captures both macro-level biological interactions and micro-level molecular influences, offering a comprehensive perspective on DDIs. The framework extracts local subgraphs from biomedical knowledge graphs and constructs hierarchical interaction graphs from molecular representations, leveraging classical graph neural network methods to learn multi-scale representations of drug pairs. To enhance accuracy and interpretability, MolecBioNet introduces two domain-specific pooling strategies: context-aware subgraph pooling (CASPool), which emphasizes biologically relevant entities, and attention-guided influence pooling (AGIPool), which prioritizes influential molecular substructures. The framework further employs mutual information minimization regularization to enhance information diversity during embedding fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that MolecBioNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in DDI prediction, while ablation studies and embedding visualizations further validate the advantages of unified drug pair modeling and multi-scale knowledge integration.

<title>Continual Reinforcement Learning by Planning with Online World Models</title>

Abstract: Continual reinforcement learning (CRL) refers to a naturalistic setting where an agent needs to endlessly evolve, by trial and error, to solve multiple tasks that are presented sequentially. One of the largest obstacles to CRL is that the agent may forget how to solve previous tasks when learning a new task, known as catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we propose to address this challenge by planning with online world models. Specifically, we learn a Follow-The-Leader shallow model online to capture the world dynamics, in which we plan using model predictive control to solve a set of tasks specified by any reward functions. The online world model is immune to forgetting by construction with a proven regret bound of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{K^2D\log(T)})$ under mild assumptions. The planner searches actions solely based on the latest online model, thus forming a FTL Online Agent (OA) that updates incrementally. To assess OA, we further design Continual Bench, a dedicated environment for CRL, and compare with several strong baselines under the same model-planning algorithmic framework. The empirical results show that OA learns continuously to solve new tasks while not forgetting old skills, outperforming agents built on deep world models with various continual learning techniques.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) demonstrate significant potential to revolutionize weather forecasting. However, most AI-driven models rely on Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems for initial condition preparation, which often consumes hours on supercomputers. Here we introduce XiChen, the first observation-scalable fully AI-driven global weather forecasting system, whose entire pipeline, from Data Assimilation (DA) to medium-range forecasting, can be accomplished within only 17 seconds. XiChen is built upon a foundation model that is pre-trained for weather forecasting. Meanwhile, this model is subsequently fine-tuned to serve as both observation operators and DA models, thereby scalably assimilating conventional and raw satellite observations. Furthermore, the integration of four-dimensional variational knowledge ensures that XiChen's DA and medium-range forecasting accuracy rivals that of operational NWP systems, amazingly achieving a skillful forecasting lead time exceeding 8.25 days. These findings demonstrate that XiChen holds strong potential toward fully AI-driven weather forecasting independent of NWP systems.

Abstract: There has been increasing interest in the generation of high-quality, realistic synthetic medical images in recent years. Such synthetic datasets can mitigate the scarcity of public datasets for artificial intelligence research, and can also be used for educational purposes. In this paper, we propose a combination of diffusion-based generation (PanoDiff) and Super-Resolution (SR) for generating synthetic dental panoramic radiographs (PRs). The former generates a low-resolution (LR) seed of a PR (256 X 128) which is then processed by the SR model to yield a high-resolution (HR) PR of size 1024 X 512. For SR, we propose a state-of-the-art transformer that learns local-global relationships, resulting in sharper edges and textures. Experimental results demonstrate a Frechet inception distance score of 40.69 between 7243 real and synthetic images (in HR). Inception scores were 2.55, 2.30, 2.90 and 2.98 for real HR, synthetic HR, real LR and synthetic LR images, respectively. Among a diverse group of six clinical experts, all evaluating a mixture of 100 synthetic and 100 real PRs in a time-limited observation, the average accuracy in distinguishing real from synthetic images was 68.5% (with 50% corresponding to random guessing).

Abstract: Context-aware emotion recognition (CAER) enhances affective computing in real-world scenarios, but traditional methods often suffer from context bias-spurious correlation between background context and emotion labels (e.g. associating ``garden'' with ``happy''). In this paper, we propose \textbf{AGCD-Net}, an Attention Guided Context Debiasing model that introduces \textit{Hybrid ConvNeXt}, a novel convolutional encoder that extends the ConvNeXt backbone by integrating Spatial Transformer Network and Squeeze-and-Excitation layers for enhanced feature recalibration. At the core of AGCD-Net is the Attention Guided - Causal Intervention Module (AG-CIM), which applies causal theory, perturbs context features, isolates spurious correlations, and performs an attention-driven correction guided by face features to mitigate context bias. Experimental results on the CAER-S dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of AGCD-Net, achieving state-of-the-art performance and highlighting the importance of causal debiasing for robust emotion recognition in complex settings.

Abstract: Patch-based transformer surrogates have become increasingly effective for modeling spatiotemporal dynamics, but the fixed patch size is a major limitation for budget-conscience deployment in production. We introduce two lightweight, architecture-agnostic modules-the Convolutional Kernel Modulator (CKM) and Convolutional Stride Modulator (CSM)-that enable dynamic patch size control at inference in patch based models, without retraining or accuracy loss. Combined with a cyclic patch-size rollout, our method mitigates patch artifacts and improves long-term stability for video-like prediction tasks. Applied to a range of challenging 2D and 3D PDE benchmarks, our approach improves rollout fidelity and runtime efficiency. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to enable inference-time patch-size tunability in patch-based PDE surrogates. Its plug-and-play design makes it broadly applicable across architectures-establishing a general foundation for compute-adaptive modeling in PDE surrogate tasks.

Abstract: Recently, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have demonstrated rich potential in computer vision domain due to their high biological plausibility, event-driven characteristic and energy-saving efficiency. Still, limited annotated event-based datasets and immature SNN architectures result in their performance inferior to that of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). To enhance the performance of SNNs on their optimal data format, DVS data, we explore using RGB data and well-performing ANNs to implement knowledge distillation. In this case, solving cross-modality and cross-architecture challenges is necessary. In this paper, we propose cross knowledge distillation (CKD), which not only leverages semantic similarity and sliding replacement to mitigate the cross-modality challenge, but also uses an indirect phased knowledge distillation to mitigate the cross-architecture challenge. We validated our method on main-stream neuromorphic datasets, including N-Caltech101 and CEP-DVS. The experimental results show that our method outperforms current State-of-the-Art methods. The code will be available at https://github.com/ShawnYE618/CKD

<title>Prompt4Trust: A Reinforcement Learning Prompt Augmentation Framework for Clinically-Aligned Confidence Calibration in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold considerable promise for applications in healthcare. However, their deployment in safety-critical settings is hindered by two key limitations: (i) sensitivity to prompt design, and (ii) a tendency to generate incorrect responses with high confidence. As clinicians may rely on a model's stated confidence to gauge the reliability of its predictions, it is especially important that when a model expresses high confidence, it is also highly accurate. We introduce Prompt4Trust, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework for prompt augmentation targeting confidence calibration in MLLMs. A lightweight LLM is trained to produce context-aware auxiliary prompts that guide a downstream task MLLM to generate responses in which the expressed confidence more accurately reflects predictive accuracy. Unlike conventional calibration techniques, Prompt4Trust specifically prioritizes aspects of calibration most critical for safe and trustworthy clinical decision-making. Beyond improvements driven by this clinically motivated calibration objective, our proposed method also improves task accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art medical visual question answering (VQA) performance on the PMC-VQA benchmark, which is composed of multiple-choice questions spanning diverse medical imaging modalities. Moreover, our framework trained with a small downstream task MLLM showed promising zero-shot generalization to larger MLLMs in our experiments, suggesting the potential for scalable calibration without the associated computational costs. This work demonstrates the potential of automated yet human-aligned prompt engineering for improving the the trustworthiness of MLLMs in safety critical settings.

Abstract: The remarkable representational power of Vision Transformers (ViTs) remains underutilized in few-shot image classification. In this work, we introduce ViT-ProtoNet, which integrates a ViT-Small backbone into the Prototypical Network framework. By averaging class conditional token embeddings from a handful of support examples, ViT-ProtoNet constructs robust prototypes that generalize to novel categories under 5-shot settings. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation on four standard benchmarks: Mini-ImageNet, FC100, CUB-200, and CIFAR-FS, including overlapped support variants to assess robustness. Across all splits, ViT-ProtoNet consistently outperforms CNN-based prototypical counterparts, achieving up to a 3.2\% improvement in 5-shot accuracy and demonstrating superior feature separability in latent space. Furthermore, it outperforms or is competitive with transformer-based competitors using a more lightweight backbone. Comprehensive ablations examine the impact of transformer depth, patch size, and fine-tuning strategy. To foster reproducibility, we release code and pretrained weights. Our results establish ViT-ProtoNet as a powerful, flexible approach for few-shot classification and set a new baseline for transformer-based meta-learners.

Abstract: Recent advances in latent diffusion models have achieved remarkable results in high-fidelity RGB image synthesis by leveraging pretrained VAEs to compress and reconstruct pixel data at low computational cost. However, the generation of transparent or layered content (RGBA image) remains largely unexplored, due to the lack of large-scale benchmarks. In this work, we propose ALPHA, the first comprehensive RGBA benchmark that adapts standard RGB metrics to four-channel images via alpha blending over canonical backgrounds. We further introduce ALPHAVAE, a unified end-to-end RGBA VAE that extends a pretrained RGB VAE by incorporating a dedicated alpha channel. The model is trained with a composite objective that combines alpha-blended pixel reconstruction, patch-level fidelity, perceptual consistency, and dual KL divergence constraints to ensure latent fidelity across both RGB and alpha representations. Our RGBA VAE, trained on only 8K images in contrast to 1M used by prior methods, achieves a +4.9 dB improvement in PSNR and a +3.2% increase in SSIM over LayerDiffuse in reconstruction. It also enables superior transparent image generation when fine-tuned within a latent diffusion framework. Our code, data, and models are released on https://github.com/o0o0o00o0/AlphaVAE for reproducibility.

Abstract: Purpose: This study introduces a novel framework for identifying and exploiting predictive lead-lag relationships in financial markets. We propose an integrated approach that combines advanced statistical methodologies with machine learning models to enhance the identification and exploitation of predictive relationships between equities. Methods: We employed a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to cluster nine prominent stocks based on their mid-range historical volatility profiles over a three-year period. From the resulting clusters, we constructed a multi-stage causal inference pipeline, incorporating the Granger Causality Test (GCT), a customised Peter-Clark Momentary Conditional Independence (PCMCI) test, and Effective Transfer Entropy (ETE) to identify robust, predictive linkages. Subsequently, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and a K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) classifier were utilised to determine the optimal time lag for trade execution. The resulting strategy was rigorously backtested. Results: The proposed volatility-based trading strategy, tested from 8 June 2023 to 12 August 2023, demonstrated substantial efficacy. The portfolio yielded a total return of 15.38%, significantly outperforming the 10.39% return of a comparative Buy-and-Hold strategy. Key performance metrics, including a Sharpe Ratio up to 2.17 and a win rate up to 100% for certain pairs, confirmed the strategy's viability. Conclusion: This research contributes a systematic and robust methodology for identifying profitable trading opportunities derived from volatility-based causal relationships. The findings have significant implications for both academic research in financial modelling and the practical application of algorithmic trading, offering a structured approach to developing resilient, data-driven strategies.

Abstract: Time series data with missing values is common across many domains. Healthcare presents special challenges due to prolonged periods of sensor disconnection. In such cases, having a confidence measure for imputed values is critical. Most existing methods either overlook model uncertainty or lack mechanisms to estimate it. To address this gap, we introduce a general framework that quantifies and leverages uncertainty for selective imputation. By focusing on values the model is most confident in, highly unreliable imputations are avoided. Our experiments on multiple EHR datasets, covering diverse types of missingness, demonstrate that selectively imputing less-uncertain values not only reduces imputation errors but also improves downstream tasks. Specifically, we show performance gains in a 24-hour mortality prediction task, underscoring the practical benefit of incorporating uncertainty into time series imputation.

Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized nucleotide sequence analysis, yet capturing long-range dependencies remains challenging. Recent studies show that autoregressive transformers often exhibit Markovian behavior by relying on fixed-length context windows for next-token prediction. However, standard self-attention mechanisms are computationally inefficient for long sequences due to their quadratic complexity and do not explicitly enforce global transition consistency.
  We introduce CARMANIA (Context-Aware Regularization with Markovian Integration for Attention-Based Nucleotide Analysis), a self-supervised pretraining framework that augments next-token (NT) prediction with a transition-matrix (TM) loss. The TM loss aligns predicted token transitions with empirically derived n-gram statistics from each input sequence, encouraging the model to capture higher-order dependencies beyond local context. This integration enables CARMANIA to learn organism-specific sequence structures that reflect both evolutionary constraints and functional organization.
  We evaluate CARMANIA across diverse genomic tasks, including regulatory element prediction, functional gene classification, taxonomic inference, antimicrobial resistance detection, and biosynthetic gene cluster classification. CARMANIA outperforms the previous best long-context model by at least 7 percent, matches state-of-the-art on shorter sequences (exceeding prior results on 20 out of 40 tasks while running approximately 2.5 times faster), and shows particularly strong improvements on enhancer and housekeeping gene classification tasks, including up to a 34 percent absolute gain in Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) for enhancer prediction. The TM loss boosts accuracy in 33 of 40 tasks, especially where local motifs or regulatory patterns drive prediction.

Abstract: Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a technique for finding correlations between different data modalities and learning low-dimensional representations. As fairness becomes crucial in machine learning, fair CCA has gained attention. However, previous approaches often overlook the impact on downstream classification tasks, limiting applicability. We propose a novel fair CCA method for fair representation learning, ensuring the projected features are independent of sensitive attributes, thus enhancing fairness without compromising accuracy. We validate our method on synthetic data and real-world data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), demonstrating its ability to maintain high correlation analysis performance while improving fairness in classification tasks. Our work enables fair machine learning in neuroimaging studies where unbiased analysis is essential.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) aligned for safety through techniques like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) often exhibit emergent deceptive behaviors, where outputs appear compliant but subtly mislead or omit critical information. This paper introduces adversarial activation patching, a novel mechanistic interpretability framework that leverages activation patching as an adversarial tool to induce, detect, and mitigate such deception in transformer-based models. By sourcing activations from "deceptive" prompts and patching them into safe forward passes at specific layers, we simulate vulnerabilities and quantify deception rates. Through toy neural network simulations across multiple scenarios (e.g., 1000 trials per setup), we demonstrate that adversarial patching increases deceptive outputs to 23.9% from a 0% baseline, with layer-specific variations supporting our hypotheses. We propose six hypotheses, including transferability across models, exacerbation in multimodal settings, and scaling effects. An expanded literature review synthesizes over 20 key works in interpretability, deception, and adversarial attacks. Mitigation strategies, such as activation anomaly detection and robust fine-tuning, are detailed, alongside ethical considerations and future research directions. This work advances AI safety by highlighting patching's dual-use potential and provides a roadmap for empirical studies on large-scale models.

Abstract: The detection and tracking of celestial surface terrain features are crucial for autonomous spaceflight applications, including Terrain Relative Navigation (TRN), Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL), hazard analysis, and scientific data collection. Traditional photoclinometry-based pipelines often rely on extensive a priori imaging and offline processing, constrained by the computational limitations of radiation-hardened systems. While historically effective, these approaches typically increase mission costs and duration, operate at low processing rates, and have limited generalization. Recently, learning-based computer vision has gained popularity to enhance spacecraft autonomy and overcome these limitations. While promising, emerging techniques frequently impose computational demands exceeding the capabilities of typical spacecraft hardware for real-time operation and are further challenged by the scarcity of labeled training data for diverse extraterrestrial environments. In this work, we present novel formulations for in-situ landmark tracking via detection and description. We utilize lightweight, computationally efficient neural network architectures designed for real-time execution on current-generation spacecraft flight processors. For landmark detection, we propose improved domain adaptation methods that enable the identification of celestial terrain features with distinct, cheaply acquired training data. Concurrently, for landmark description, we introduce a novel attention alignment formulation that learns robust feature representations that maintain correspondence despite significant landmark viewpoint variations. Together, these contributions form a unified system for landmark tracking that demonstrates superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships in multivariate time series (MTS) is essential for effective decision-making in fields such as finance and marketing, where complex dependencies and lagged effects challenge conventional analytical approaches. We introduce Dynamic Sparse Causal-Attention Temporal Networks for Interpretable Causality Discovery in MTS (DyCAST-Net), a novel architecture designed to enhance causal discovery by integrating dilated temporal convolutions and dynamic sparse attention mechanisms. DyCAST-Net effectively captures multiscale temporal dependencies through dilated convolutions while leveraging an adaptive thresholding strategy in its attention mechanism to eliminate spurious connections, ensuring both accuracy and interpretability. A statistical shuffle test validation further strengthens robustness by filtering false positives and improving causal inference reliability. Extensive evaluations on financial and marketing datasets demonstrate that DyCAST-Net consistently outperforms existing models such as TCDF, GCFormer, and CausalFormer. The model provides a more precise estimation of causal delays and significantly reduces false discoveries, particularly in noisy environments. Moreover, attention heatmaps offer interpretable insights, uncovering hidden causal patterns such as the mediated effects of advertising on consumer behavior and the influence of macroeconomic indicators on financial markets. Case studies illustrate DyCAST-Net's ability to detect latent mediators and lagged causal factors, making it particularly effective in high-dimensional, dynamic settings. The model's architecture enhanced by RMSNorm stabilization and causal masking ensures scalability and adaptability across diverse application domains

<title>Transformers Don't In-Context Learn Least Squares Regression</title>

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful capability of large pretrained transformers, enabling them to solve new tasks implicit in example input-output pairs without any gradient updates. Despite its practical success, the mechanisms underlying ICL remain largely mysterious. In this work we study synthetic linear regression to probe how transformers implement learning at inference time. Previous works have demonstrated that transformers match the performance of learning rules such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression or gradient descent and have suggested ICL is facilitated in transformers through the learned implementation of one of these techniques. In this work, we demonstrate through a suite of out-of-distribution generalization experiments that transformers trained for ICL fail to generalize after shifts in the prompt distribution, a behaviour that is inconsistent with the notion of transformers implementing algorithms such as OLS. Finally, we highlight the role of the pretraining corpus in shaping ICL behaviour through a spectral analysis of the learned representations in the residual stream. Inputs from the same distribution as the training data produce representations with a unique spectral signature: inputs from this distribution tend to have the same top two singular vectors. This spectral signature is not shared by out-of-distribution inputs, and a metric characterizing the presence of this signature is highly correlated with low loss.

Abstract: The integration of Fourier transform and deep learning opens new avenues for time series forecasting. We reconsider the Fourier transform from a basis functions perspective. Specifically, the real and imaginary parts of the frequency components can be regarded as the coefficients of cosine and sine basis functions at tiered frequency levels, respectively. We find that existing Fourier-based methods face inconsistent starting cycles and inconsistent series length issues. They fail to interpret frequency components precisely and overlook temporal information. Accordingly, the novel Fourier Basis Mapping (FBM) method addresses these issues by integrating time-frequency features through Fourier basis expansion and mapping in the time-frequency space. Our approach extracts explicit frequency features while preserving temporal characteristics. FBM supports plug-and-play integration with various types of neural networks by only adjusting the first initial projection layer for better performance. First, we propose FBM-L, FBM-NL, and FBM-NP to enhance linear, MLP-based, and Transformer-based models, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of time-frequency features. Next, we propose a synergetic model architecture, termed FBM-S, which decomposes the seasonal, trend, and interaction effects into three separate blocks, each designed to model time-frequency features in a specialized manner. Finally, we introduce several techniques tailored for time-frequency features, including interaction masking, centralization, patching, rolling window projection, and multi-scale down-sampling. The results are validated on diverse real-world datasets for both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks with SOTA performance.

Abstract: Clinical monitoring of functional decline in ALS relies on periodic assessments that may miss critical changes occurring between visits. To address this gap, semi-supervised regression models were developed to estimate rates of decline in a case series cohort by targeting ALSFRS- R scale trajectories with continuous in-home sensor monitoring data. Our analysis compared three model paradigms (individual batch learning and cohort-level batch versus incremental fine-tuned transfer learning) across linear slope, cubic polynomial, and ensembled self-attention pseudo-label interpolations. Results revealed cohort homogeneity across functional domains responding to learning methods, with transfer learning improving prediction error for ALSFRS-R subscales in 28 of 32 contrasts (mean RMSE=0.20(0.04)), and individual batch learning for predicting the composite scale (mean RMSE=3.15(1.25)) in 2 of 3. Self-attention interpolation achieved the lowest prediction error for subscale-level models (mean RMSE=0.19(0.06)), capturing complex nonlinear progression patterns, outperforming linear and cubic interpolations in 20 of 32 contrasts, though linear interpolation proved more stable in all ALSFRS-R composite scale models (mean RMSE=0.23(0.10)). We identified distinct homogeneity-heterogeneity profiles across functional domains with respiratory and speech exhibiting patient-specific patterns benefiting from personalized incremental adaptation, while swallowing and dressing functions followed cohort-level trajectories suitable for transfer models. These findings suggest that matching learning and pseudo-labeling techniques to functional domain-specific homogeneity-heterogeneity profiles enhances predictive accuracy in ALS progression tracking. Integrating adaptive model selection within sensor monitoring platforms could enable timely interventions and scalable deployment in future multi-center studies.

Abstract: This study explores the optimization of the DRAGON Longformer base model for clinical text classification, specifically targeting the binary classification of medical case descriptions. A dataset of 500 clinical cases containing structured medical observations was used, with 400 cases for training and 100 for validation. Enhancements to the pre-trained joeranbosma/dragon-longformer-base-mixed-domain model included hyperparameter tuning, domain-specific preprocessing, and architectural adjustments. Key modifications involved increasing sequence length from 512 to 1024 tokens, adjusting learning rates from 1e-05 to 5e-06, extending training epochs from 5 to 8, and incorporating specialized medical terminology. The optimized model achieved notable performance gains: accuracy improved from 72.0% to 85.2%, precision from 68.0% to 84.1%, recall from 75.0% to 86.3%, and F1-score from 71.0% to 85.2%. Statistical analysis confirmed the significance of these improvements (p < .001). The model demonstrated enhanced capability in interpreting medical terminology, anatomical measurements, and clinical observations. These findings contribute to domain-specific language model research and offer practical implications for clinical natural language processing applications. The optimized model's strong performance across diverse medical conditions underscores its potential for broad use in healthcare settings.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) lifts the factuality of Large Language Models (LLMs) by injecting external knowledge, yet it falls short on problems that demand multi-step inference; conversely, purely reasoning-oriented approaches often hallucinate or mis-ground facts. This survey synthesizes both strands under a unified reasoning-retrieval perspective. We first map how advanced reasoning optimizes each stage of RAG (Reasoning-Enhanced RAG). Then, we show how retrieved knowledge of different type supply missing premises and expand context for complex inference (RAG-Enhanced Reasoning). Finally, we spotlight emerging Synergized RAG-Reasoning frameworks, where (agentic) LLMs iteratively interleave search and reasoning to achieve state-of-the-art performance across knowledge-intensive benchmarks. We categorize methods, datasets, and open challenges, and outline research avenues toward deeper RAG-Reasoning systems that are more effective, multimodally-adaptive, trustworthy, and human-centric. The collection is available at https://github.com/DavidZWZ/Awesome-RAG-Reasoning.

<title>Evaluating LLMs on Sequential API Call Through Automated Test Generation</title>

Abstract: By integrating tools from external APIs, Large Language Models (LLMs) have expanded their promising capabilities in a diverse spectrum of complex real-world tasks. However, testing, evaluation, and analysis of LLM tool use remain in their early stages. Most existing benchmarks rely on manually collected test cases, many of which cannot be automatically checked for semantic correctness and instead depend on static methods such as string matching. Additionally, these benchmarks often overlook the complex interactions that occur between sequential API calls, which are common in real-world applications. To fill the gap, in this paper, we introduce StateGen, an automated framework designed to generate diverse coding tasks involving sequential API interactions. StateGen combines state-machine-based API constraint solving and validation, energy-based sampling, and control-flow injection to generate executable programs. These programs are then translated into human-like natural language task descriptions through a collaboration of two LLM agents. Utilizing StateGen, we construct StateEval, a benchmark encompassing 120 verified test cases spanning across three representative scenarios: Session Service, Tensor Operation, and ElevenLabs MCP. Experimental results confirm that StateGen can effectively generate challenging and realistic API-oriented tasks, highlighting areas for improvement in current LLMs incorporating APIs.

<title>ViSP: A PPO-Driven Framework for Sarcasm Generation with Contrastive Learning</title>

Abstract: Human emotions are complex, with sarcasm being a subtle and distinctive form. Despite progress in sarcasm research, sarcasm generation remains underexplored, primarily due to the overreliance on textual modalities and the neglect of visual cues, as well as the mismatch between image content and sarcastic intent in existing datasets. In this paper, we introduce M2SaG, a multimodal sarcasm generation dataset with 4,970 samples, each containing an image, a sarcastic text, and a sarcasm target. To benchmark M2SaG, we propose ViSP, a generation framework that integrates Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and contrastive learning. PPO utilizes reward scores from DIP to steer the generation of sarcastic texts, while contrastive learning encourages the model to favor outputs with higher reward scores. These strategies improve overall generation quality and produce texts with more pronounced sarcastic intent. We evaluate ViSP across five metric sets and find it surpasses all baselines, including large language models, underscoring their limitations in sarcasm generation. Furthermore, we analyze the distributions of Sarcasm Scores and Factual Incongruity for both M2SaG and the texts generated by ViSP. The generated texts exhibit higher mean Sarcasm Scores (0.898 vs. 0.770) and Factual Incongruity (0.768 vs. 0.739), demonstrating that ViSP produces higher-quality sarcastic content than the original dataset. % The dataset and code will be publicly available. Our dataset and code will be released at \textit{https://github.com/wclapply/ViSP}.

Abstract: Visual and semantic concepts are often structured in a hierarchical manner. For instance, textual concept `cat' entails all images of cats. A recent study, MERU, successfully adapts multimodal learning techniques from Euclidean space to hyperbolic space, effectively capturing the visual-semantic hierarchy. However, a critical question remains: how can we more efficiently train a model to capture and leverage this hierarchy? In this paper, we propose the \textit{Hyperbolic Masked Image and Distillation Network} (HMID-Net), a novel and efficient method that integrates Masked Image Modeling (MIM) and knowledge distillation techniques within hyperbolic space. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to leverage MIM and knowledge distillation in hyperbolic space to train highly efficient models. In addition, we introduce a distillation loss function specifically designed to facilitate effective knowledge transfer in hyperbolic space. Our experiments demonstrate that MIM and knowledge distillation techniques in hyperbolic space can achieve the same remarkable success as in Euclidean space. Extensive evaluations show that our method excels across a wide range of downstream tasks, significantly outperforming existing models like MERU and CLIP in both image classification and retrieval.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image classification plays a pivotal role in precision agriculture, providing accurate insights into crop health monitoring, disease detection, and soil analysis. However, traditional methods struggle with high-dimensional data, spectral-spatial redundancy, and the scarcity of labeled samples, often leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose the Self-Adaptive Tensor- Regularized Network (SDTN), which combines tensor decomposition with regularization mechanisms to dynamically adjust tensor ranks, ensuring optimal feature representation tailored to the complexity of the data. Building upon SDTN, we propose the Tensor-Regularized Network (TRN), which integrates the features extracted by SDTN into a lightweight network capable of capturing spectral-spatial features at multiple scales. This approach not only maintains high classification accuracy but also significantly reduces computational complexity, making the framework highly suitable for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments. Experiments on PaviaU datasets demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and reduced model parameters compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become proficient at sophisticated code-generation tasks, yet remain ineffective at reliably detecting or avoiding code vulnerabilities. Does this deficiency stem from insufficient learning about code vulnerabilities, or is it merely a result of ineffective prompting? Using representation engineering techniques, we investigate whether LLMs internally encode the concepts necessary to identify code vulnerabilities. We find that current LLMs encode precise internal representations that distinguish vulnerable from secure code--achieving greater accuracy than standard prompting approaches. Leveraging these vulnerability-sensitive representations, we develop an inference-time steering technique that subtly modulates the model's token-generation probabilities through a mixture of corrections (MoC). Our method effectively guides LLMs to produce less vulnerable code without compromising functionality, demonstrating a practical approach to controlled vulnerability management in generated code. Notably, MoC enhances the security ratio of Qwen2.5-Coder-7B by 8.9\%, while simultaneously improving functionality on HumanEval pass@1 by 2.1\%.

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) reduce the quadratic complexity of transformers by leveraging linear recurrence. Recently, VMamba has emerged as a strong SSM-based vision backbone, yet remains bottlenecked by spatial redundancy in its four-directional scan. We propose QuarterMap, a post-training activation pruning method that removes redundant spatial activations before scanning and restores dimensions via nearest-neighbor upsampling. Our method improves throughput without retraining. On ImageNet-1K, QuarterMap achieves up to 11% speedup on VMamba with less than 0.9% accuracy drop, and yields similar gains on ADE20K segmentation. Beyond VMamba, we validate QuarterMap on MedMamba, a domain-specific model that shares the same four-directional scanning structure, where it consistently improves throughput while preserving accuracy across multiple medical imaging tasks. Compared to token merging methods like ToMe, QuarterMap is tailored for SSMs and avoids costly merge-unmerge operations. Our method offers a plug-and-play tool for deployment-time efficiency without compromising transferability.

Abstract: The hallmark feature of temporal-difference (TD) learning is bootstrapping: using value predictions to generate new value predictions. The vast majority of TD methods for control learn a policy by bootstrapping from a single action-value function (e.g., Q-learning and Sarsa). Significantly less attention has been given to methods that bootstrap from two asymmetric value functions: i.e., methods that learn state values as an intermediate step in learning action values. Existing algorithms in this vein can be categorized as either QV-learning or AV-learning. Though these algorithms have been investigated to some degree in prior work, it remains unclear if and when it is advantageous to learn two value functions instead of just one -- and whether such approaches are theoretically sound in general. In this paper, we analyze these algorithmic families in terms of convergence and sample efficiency. We find that while both families are more efficient than Expected Sarsa in the prediction setting, only AV-learning methods offer any major benefit over Q-learning in the control setting. Finally, we introduce a new AV-learning algorithm called Regularized Dueling Q-learning (RDQ), which significantly outperforms Dueling DQN in the MinAtar benchmark.

Abstract: Key Information Extraction (KIE) underpins the understanding of visual documents (e.g., receipts and contracts) by extracting precise semantic content and accurately capturing spatial structure. Yet existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often perform poorly on dense documents and rely on vision tokenization approaches that scale with image size, leading to redundant computation and memory inefficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce VDInstruct, an MLLM that separates spatial region detection from semantic feature extraction. Central to our model is a content-aware tokenization strategy: rather than fragmenting the entire image uniformly, it generates tokens in proportion to document complexity, preserving critical structure while eliminating wasted tokens. Leveraging a three-stage training paradigm, our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on KIE benchmarks, matching or exceeding the accuracy of leading approaches while reducing the number of image tokens by roughly 3.6x. In zero-shot evaluations, VDInstruct surpasses strong baselines-such as DocOwl 1.5-by +5.5 F1 points, highlighting its robustness to unseen documents. These findings show that content-aware tokenization combined with explicit layout modeling offers a promising direction forward for document understanding. Data, source code, and model weights will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Using neuromorphic computing for robotics applications has gained much attention in recent year due to the remarkable ability of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for high-precision yet low memory and compute complexity inference when implemented in neuromorphic hardware. This ability makes SNNs well-suited for autonomous robot applications (such as in drones and rovers) where battery resources and payload are typically limited. Within this context, this paper studies the use of SNNs for performing direct robot navigation and obstacle avoidance from LIDAR data. A custom robot platform equipped with a LIDAR is set up for collecting a labeled dataset of LIDAR sensing data together with the human-operated robot control commands used for obstacle avoidance. Crucially, this paper provides what is, to the best of our knowledge, a first focused study about the importance of neuron membrane leakage on the SNN precision when processing LIDAR data for obstacle avoidance. It is shown that by carefully tuning the membrane potential leakage constant of the spiking Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons used within our SNN, it is possible to achieve on-par robot control precision compared to the use of a non-spiking Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Finally, the LIDAR dataset collected during this work is released as open-source with the hope of benefiting future research.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has revolutionized image segmentation through its innovative prompt-based approach, yet the critical role of prompt engineering in its success remains underexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey focusing specifically on prompt engineering techniques for SAM and its variants. We systematically organize and analyze the rapidly growing body of work in this emerging field, covering fundamental methodologies, practical applications, and key challenges. Our review reveals how prompt engineering has evolved from simple geometric inputs to sophisticated multimodal approaches, enabling SAM's adaptation across diverse domains including medical imaging and remote sensing. We identify unique challenges in prompt optimization and discuss promising research directions. This survey fills an important gap in the literature by providing a structured framework for understanding and advancing prompt engineering in foundation models for segmentation.

Abstract: A critical challenge in recommender systems is to establish reliable relationships between offline and online metrics that predict real-world performance. Motivated by recent advances in Pareto front approximation, we introduce a pragmatic strategy for identifying offline metrics that align with online impact. A key advantage of this approach is its ability to simultaneously serve multiple test groups, each with distinct offline performance metrics, in an online experiment controlled by a single model. The method is model-agnostic for systems with a neural network backbone, enabling broad applicability across architectures and domains. We validate the strategy through a large-scale online experiment in the field of session-based recommender systems on the OTTO e-commerce platform. The online experiment identifies significant alignments between offline metrics and real-word click-through rate, post-click conversion rate and units sold. Our strategy provides industry practitioners with a valuable tool for understanding offline-to-online metric relationships and making informed, data-driven decisions.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image models produce high-quality results but still struggle with precise visual control, balancing multimodal inputs, and requiring extensive training for complex multimodal image generation. To address these limitations, we propose MENTOR, a novel autoregressive (AR) framework for efficient Multimodal-conditioned Tuning for Autoregressive multimodal image generation. MENTOR combines an AR image generator with a two-stage training paradigm, enabling fine-grained, token-level alignment between multimodal inputs and image outputs without relying on auxiliary adapters or cross-attention modules. The two-stage training consists of: (1) a multimodal alignment stage that establishes robust pixel- and semantic-level alignment, followed by (2) a multimodal instruction tuning stage that balances the integration of multimodal inputs and enhances generation controllability. Despite modest model size, suboptimal base components, and limited training resources, MENTOR achieves strong performance on the DreamBench++ benchmark, outperforming competitive baselines in concept preservation and prompt following. Additionally, our method delivers superior image reconstruction fidelity, broad task adaptability, and improved training efficiency compared to diffusion-based methods.

Abstract: The advent of powerful, accessible Large Language Models (LLMs) like Google's Gemini presents new opportunities for democratizing financial data analysis. This paper documents the design, implementation, and iterative debugging of a novel, serverless system for real-time stock analysis. The system leverages the Gemini API for qualitative assessment, automates data ingestion and processing via GitHub Actions, and presents the findings through a decoupled, static frontend. We detail the architectural evolution of the system, from initial concepts to a robust, event-driven pipeline, highlighting the practical challenges encountered during deployment. A significant portion of this paper is dedicated to a case study on the debugging process, covering common software errors, platform-specific permission issues, and rare, environment-level platform bugs. The final architecture operates at a near-zero cost, demonstrating a viable model for individuals to build sophisticated AI-powered financial tools. The operational application is publicly accessible, and the complete source code is available for review. We conclude by discussing the role of LLMs in financial analysis, the importance of robust debugging methodologies, and the emerging paradigm of human-AI collaboration in software development.

Abstract: We introduce the THOR (Transformer Heuristics for On-Demand Retrieval) Module, designed and implemented by eSapiens, a secure, scalable engine that transforms natural-language questions into verified, read-only SQL analytics for enterprise databases. The Text-to-SQL module follows a decoupled orchestration/execution architecture: a Supervisor Agent routes queries, Schema Retrieval dynamically injects table and column metadata, and a SQL Generation Agent emits single-statement SELECT queries protected by a read-only guardrail. An integrated Self-Correction & Rating loop captures empty results, execution errors, or low-quality outputs and triggers up to five LLM-driven regeneration attempts. Finally, a Result Interpretation Agent produces concise, human-readable insights and hands raw rows to the Insight & Intelligence engine for visualization or forecasting.
  Smoke tests across finance, sales, and operations scenarios demonstrate reliable ad-hoc querying and automated periodic reporting. By embedding schema awareness, fault-tolerant execution, and compliance guardrails, the THOR Module empowers non-technical users to access live data with zero-SQL simplicity and enterprise-grade safety.

Abstract: General-purpose sentence embedding models often struggle to capture specialized financial semantics, especially in low-resource languages like Korean, due to domain-specific jargon, temporal meaning shifts, and misaligned bilingual vocabularies. To address these gaps, we introduce NMIXX (Neural eMbeddings for Cross-lingual eXploration of Finance), a suite of cross-lingual embedding models fine-tuned with 18.8K high-confidence triplets that pair in-domain paraphrases, hard negatives derived from a semantic-shift typology, and exact Korean-English translations. Concurrently, we release KorFinSTS, a 1,921-pair Korean financial STS benchmark spanning news, disclosures, research reports, and regulations, designed to expose nuances that general benchmarks miss.
  When evaluated against seven open-license baselines, NMIXX's multilingual bge-m3 variant achieves Spearman's rho gains of +0.10 on English FinSTS and +0.22 on KorFinSTS, outperforming its pre-adaptation checkpoint and surpassing other models by the largest margin, while revealing a modest trade-off in general STS performance. Our analysis further shows that models with richer Korean token coverage adapt more effectively, underscoring the importance of tokenizer design in low-resource, cross-lingual settings. By making both models and the benchmark publicly available, we provide the community with robust tools for domain-adapted, multilingual representation learning in finance.

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative machine learning while preserving data privacy. However, the rise of federated unlearning, designed to allow clients to erase their data from the global model, introduces new privacy concerns. Specifically, the gradient exchanges during the unlearning process can leak sensitive information about deleted data. In this paper, we introduce DRAGD, a novel attack that exploits gradient discrepancies before and after unlearning to reconstruct forgotten data. We also present DRAGDP, an enhanced version of DRAGD that leverages publicly available prior data to improve reconstruction accuracy, particularly for complex datasets like facial images. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that DRAGD and DRAGDP significantly outperform existing methods in data reconstruction.Our work highlights a critical privacy vulnerability in federated unlearning and offers a practical solution, advancing the security of federated unlearning systems in real-world applications.

Abstract: Stroke is one of the leading causes of death globally, making early and accurate diagnosis essential for improving patient outcomes, particularly in emergency settings where timely intervention is critical. CT scans are the key imaging modality because of their speed, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness. This study proposed an artificial intelligence framework for multiclass stroke classification (ischemic, hemorrhagic, and no stroke) using CT scan images from a dataset provided by the Republic of Turkey's Ministry of Health. The proposed method adopted MaxViT, a state-of-the-art Vision Transformer, as the primary deep learning model for image-based stroke classification, with additional transformer variants (vision transformer, transformer-in-transformer, and ConvNext). To enhance model generalization and address class imbalance, we applied data augmentation techniques, including synthetic image generation. The MaxViT model trained with augmentation achieved the best performance, reaching an accuracy and F1-score of 98.00%, outperforming all other evaluated models and the baseline methods. The primary goal of this study was to distinguish between stroke types with high accuracy while addressing crucial issues of transparency and trust in artificial intelligence models. To achieve this, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) was integrated into the framework, particularly Grad-CAM++. It provides visual explanations of the model's decisions by highlighting relevant stroke regions in the CT scans and establishing an accurate, interpretable, and clinically applicable solution for early stroke detection. This research contributed to the development of a trustworthy AI-assisted diagnostic tool for stroke, facilitating its integration into clinical practice and enhancing access to timely and optimal stroke diagnosis in emergency departments, thereby saving more lives.

Abstract: In recent years, the rampant spread of misinformation on social media has made accurate detection of multimodal fake news a critical research focus. However, previous research has not adequately understood the semantics of images, and models struggle to discern news authenticity with limited textual information. Meanwhile, treating all emotional types of news uniformly without tailored approaches further leads to performance degradation. Therefore, we propose a novel Knowledge Augmentation and Emotion Guidance Network (KEN). On the one hand, we effectively leverage LVLM's powerful semantic understanding and extensive world knowledge. For images, the generated captions provide a comprehensive understanding of image content and scenes, while for text, the retrieved evidence helps break the information silos caused by the closed and limited text and context. On the other hand, we consider inter-class differences between different emotional types of news through balanced learning, achieving fine-grained modeling of the relationship between emotional types and authenticity. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our KEN.

Abstract: Programming-by-prompting with generative AI offers a new paradigm for end-user programming, shifting the focus from syntactic fluency to semantic intent. This shift holds particular promise for non-programmers such as educators, who can describe instructional goals in natural language to generate interactive learning content. Yet in bypassing direct code authoring, many of programming's core affordances - such as traceability, stepwise refinement, and behavioral testing - are lost. We propose the Chain-of-Abstractions (CoA) framework as a way to recover these affordances while preserving the expressive flexibility of natural language. CoA decomposes the synthesis process into a sequence of cognitively meaningful, task-aligned representations that function as checkpoints for specification, inspection, and refinement. We instantiate this approach in SimStep, an authoring environment for teachers that scaffolds simulation creation through four intermediate abstractions: Concept Graph, Scenario Graph, Learning Goal Graph, and UI Interaction Graph. To address ambiguities and misalignments, SimStep includes an inverse correction process that surfaces in-filled model assumptions and enables targeted revision without requiring users to manipulate code. Evaluations with educators show that CoA enables greater authoring control and interpretability in programming-by-prompting workflows.

Abstract: We investigate the integration of Conformal Prediction (CP) with supervised learning on deterministically encrypted data, aiming to bridge the gap between rigorous uncertainty quantification and privacy-preserving machine learning. Using AES-encrypted variants of the MNIST dataset, we demonstrate that CP methods remain effective even when applied directly in the encrypted domain, owing to the preservation of data exchangeability under fixed-key encryption. We test traditional $p$-value-based against $e$-value-based conformal predictors. Our empirical evaluation reveals that models trained on deterministically encrypted data retain the ability to extract meaningful structure, achieving 36.88\% test accuracy -- significantly above random guessing (9.56\%) observed with per-instance encryption. Moreover, $e$-value-based CP achieves predictive set coverage of over 60\% with 4.3 loss-threshold calibration, correctly capturing the true label in 4888 out of 5000 test cases. In contrast, the $p$-value-based CP yields smaller predictive sets but with reduced coverage accuracy. These findings highlight both the promise and limitations of CP in encrypted data settings and underscore critical trade-offs between prediction set compactness and reliability. %Our work sets a foundation for principled uncertainty quantification in secure, privacy-aware learning systems.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach, OrQstrator, which is a modular framework for conducting quantum circuit optimization in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. Our framework is powered by Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Our orchestration engine intelligently selects among three complementary circuit optimizers: A DRL-based circuit rewriter trained to reduce depth and gate count via learned rewrite sequences; a domain-specific optimizer that performs efficient local gate resynthesis and numeric optimization; a parameterized circuit instantiator that improves compilation by optimizing template circuits during gate set translation. These modules are coordinated by a central orchestration engine that learns coordination policies based on circuit structure, hardware constraints, and backend-aware performance features such as gate count, depth, and expected fidelity. The system outputs an optimized circuit for hardware-aware transpilation and execution, leveraging techniques from an existing state-of-the-art approach, called the NISQ Analyzer, to adapt to backend constraints.

Abstract: Text classification plays a pivotal role in edge computing applications like industrial monitoring, health diagnostics, and smart assistants, where low latency and high accuracy are both key requirements. Generative classifiers, in particular, have been shown to exhibit robustness to out-of-distribution and noisy data, which is an extremely critical consideration for deployment in such real-time edge environments. However, deploying such models on edge devices faces computational and memory constraints. Post Training Quantization (PTQ) reduces model size and compute costs without retraining, making it ideal for edge deployment. In this work, we present a comprehensive comparative study of generative and discriminative Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-based text classification models with PTQ using the Brevitas quantization library. We evaluate both types of classifier models across multiple bitwidths and assess their robustness under regular and noisy input conditions. We find that while discriminative classifiers remain robust, generative ones are more sensitive to bitwidth, calibration data used during PTQ, and input noise during quantized inference. We study the influence of class imbalance in calibration data for both types of classifiers, comparing scenarios with evenly and unevenly distributed class samples including their effect on weight adjustments and activation profiles during PTQ. Using test statistics derived from nonparametric hypothesis testing, we identify that using class imbalanced data during calibration introduces insufficient weight adaptation at lower bitwidths for generative LSTM classifiers, thereby leading to degraded performance. This study underscores the role of calibration data in PTQ and when generative classifiers succeed or fail under noise, aiding deployment in edge environments.

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive open-source framework for developing correlation kernels, with a particular focus on user-defined and composition of kernels for surrogate modeling. By advancing kernel-based modeling techniques, we incorporate frequency-aware elements that effectively capture complex mechanical behaviors and timefrequency dynamics intrinsic to aircraft systems. Traditional kernel functions, often limited to exponential-based methods, are extended to include a wider range of kernels such as exponential squared sine and rational quadratic kernels, along with their respective firstand second-order derivatives. The proposed methodologies are first validated on a sinus cardinal test case and then applied to forecasting Mauna-Loa Carbon Dioxide (CO 2 ) concentrations and airline passenger traffic. All these advancements are integrated into the open-source Surrogate Modeling Toolbox (SMT 2.0), providing a versatile platform for both standard and customizable kernel configurations. Furthermore, the framework enables the combination of various kernels to leverage their unique strengths into composite models tailored to specific problems. The resulting framework offers a flexible toolset for engineers and researchers, paving the way for numerous future applications in metamodeling for complex, frequency-sensitive domains.

Abstract: We present EPT-2, the latest iteration in our Earth Physics Transformer (EPT) family of foundation AI models for Earth system forecasting. EPT-2 delivers substantial improvements over its predecessor, EPT-1.5, and sets a new state of the art in predicting energy-relevant variables-including 10m and 100m wind speed, 2m temperature, and surface solar radiation-across the full 0-240h forecast horizon. It consistently outperforms leading AI weather models such as Microsoft Aurora, as well as the operational numerical forecast system IFS HRES from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). In parallel, we introduce a perturbation-based ensemble model of EPT-2 for probabilistic forecasting, called EPT-2e. Remarkably, EPT-2e significantly surpasses the ECMWF ENS mean-long considered the gold standard for medium- to longrange forecasting-while operating at a fraction of the computational cost. EPT models, as well as third-party forecasts, are accessible via the app.jua.ai platform.

Abstract: Ants achieve robust visual homing with minimal sensory input and only a few learning walks, inspiring biomimetic solutions for autonomous navigation. While Mushroom Body (MB) models have been used in robotic route following, they have not yet been applied to visual homing. We present the first real-world implementation of a lateralized MB architecture for visual homing onboard a compact autonomous car-like robot. We test whether the sign of the angular path integration (PI) signal can categorize panoramic views, acquired during learning walks and encoded in the MB, into "goal on the left" and "goal on the right" memory banks, enabling robust homing in natural outdoor settings. We validate this approach through four incremental experiments: (1) simulation showing attractor-like nest dynamics; (2) real-world homing after decoupled learning walks, producing nest search behavior; (3) homing after random walks using noisy PI emulated with GPS-RTK; and (4) precise stopping-at-the-goal behavior enabled by a fifth MB Output Neuron (MBON) encoding goal-views to control velocity. This mimics the accurate homing behavior of ants and functionally resembles waypoint-based position control in robotics, despite relying solely on visual input. Operating at 8 Hz on a Raspberry Pi 4 with 32x32 pixel views and a memory footprint under 9 kB, our system offers a biologically grounded, resource-efficient solution for autonomous visual homing.

Abstract: We present the first foundational AI model for universal physics simulation that learns physical laws directly from boundary-condition data without requiring a priori equation encoding. Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and finite-difference methods necessitate explicit mathematical formulation of governing equations, fundamentally limiting their generalizability and discovery potential. Our sketch-guided diffusion transformer approach reimagines computational physics by treating simulation as a conditional generation problem, where spatial boundary conditions guide the synthesis of physically accurate steady-state solutions.
  By leveraging enhanced diffusion transformer architectures with novel spatial relationship encoding, our model achieves direct boundary-to-equilibrium mapping and is generalizable to diverse physics domains. Unlike sequential time-stepping methods that accumulate errors over iterations, our approach bypasses temporal integration entirely, directly generating steady-state solutions with SSIM > 0.8 while maintaining sub-pixel boundary accuracy. Our data-informed approach enables physics discovery through learned representations analyzable via Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), revealing emergent physical relationships without predetermined mathematical constraints. This work represents a paradigm shift from AI-accelerated physics to AI-discovered physics, establishing the first truly universal physics simulation framework.

Abstract: Pneumonia is a leading cause of mortality in children under five, requiring accurate chest X-ray diagnosis. This study presents a machine learning-based Pediatric Chest Pneumonia Classification System to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The CNN-based model was trained on 5,863 labeled chest X-ray images from children aged 0-5 years from the Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center. To address limited data, we applied augmentation techniques (rotation, zooming, shear, horizontal flipping) and employed GANs to generate synthetic images, addressing class imbalance. The system achieved optimal performance using combined original, augmented, and GAN-generated data, evaluated through accuracy and F1 score metrics. The final model was deployed via a Flask web application, enabling real-time classification with probability estimates. Results demonstrate the potential of deep learning and GANs in improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency for pediatric pneumonia classification, particularly valuable in resource-limited clinical settings https://github.com/AbdulManaf12/Pediatric-Chest-Pneumonia-Classification

Abstract: Hacker forums provide critical early warning signals for emerging cybersecurity threats, but extracting actionable intelligence from their unstructured and noisy content remains a significant challenge. This paper presents an unsupervised framework that automatically detects, clusters, and prioritizes security events discussed across hacker forum posts. Our approach leverages Transformer-based embeddings fine-tuned with contrastive learning to group related discussions into distinct security event clusters, identifying incidents like zero-day disclosures or malware releases without relying on predefined keywords. The framework incorporates a daily ranking mechanism that prioritizes identified events using quantifiable metrics reflecting timeliness, source credibility, information completeness, and relevance. Experimental evaluation on real-world hacker forum data demonstrates that our method effectively reduces noise and surfaces high-priority threats, enabling security analysts to mount proactive responses. By transforming disparate hacker forum discussions into structured, actionable intelligence, our work addresses fundamental challenges in automated threat detection and analysis.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) and State of Health (SOH) is essential for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) across a wide range of industrial applications. We propose a novel framework -- Reinforced Graph-Based Physics-Informed Neural Networks Enhanced with Dynamic Weights (RGPD) -- that combines physics-based supervision with advanced spatio-temporal learning. Graph Convolutional Recurrent Networks (GCRNs) embed graph-convolutional filters within recurrent units to capture how node representations evolve over time. Graph Attention Convolution (GATConv) leverages a self-attention mechanism to compute learnable, edge-wise attention coefficients, dynamically weighting neighbor contributions for adaptive spatial aggregation. A Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) module is positioned between the Temporal Attention Unit (TAU) and GCRN to further improve the spatio-temporal learning. This module improves attention and prediction accuracy by dynamically scaling hidden representations to minimize noise and highlight informative features. To identify the most relevant physical constraints in each area, Q-learning agents dynamically assign weights to physics-informed loss terms, improving generalization across real-time industrial systems and reducing the need for manual tuning. In both RUL and SOH estimation tasks, the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, demonstrating strong robustness and predictive accuracy across varied degradation patterns across three diverse industrial benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Bit-level sparsity in quantized deep neural networks (DNNs) offers significant potential for optimizing Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations. However, two key challenges still limit its practical exploitation. First, conventional bit-serial approaches cannot simultaneously leverage the sparsity of both factors, leading to a complete waste of one factor' s sparsity. Methods designed to exploit dual-factor sparsity are still in the early stages of exploration, facing the challenge of partial product explosion. Second, the fluctuation of bit-level sparsity leads to variable cycle counts for MAC operations. Existing synchronous scheduling schemes that are suitable for dual-factor sparsity exhibit poor flexibility and still result in significant underutilization of MAC units. To address the first challenge, this study proposes a MAC unit that leverages dual-factor sparsity through the emerging particlization-based approach. The proposed design addresses the issue of partial product explosion through simple control logic, resulting in a more area- and energy-efficient MAC unit. In addition, by discarding less significant intermediate results, the design allows for further hardware simplification at the cost of minor accuracy loss. To address the second challenge, a quasi-synchronous scheme is introduced that adds cycle-level elasticity to the MAC array, reducing pipeline stalls and thereby improving MAC unit utilization. Evaluation results show that the exact version of the proposed MAC array architecture achieves a 29.2% improvement in area efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art bit-sparsity-driven architecture, while maintaining comparable energy efficiency. The approximate variant further improves energy efficiency by 7.5%, compared to the exact version. Index-Terms: DNN acceleration, Bit-level sparsity, MAC unit

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLM) have led to a new class of autonomous agents, renewing and expanding interest in the area. LLM-powered Multiagent Systems (MAS) have thus emerged, both for assistive and simulation purposes, yet tools for realistic human behavior simulation -- with its distinctive challenges and opportunities -- remain underdeveloped. Existing MAS libraries and tools lack fine-grained persona specifications, population sampling facilities, experimentation support, and integrated validation, among other key capabilities, limiting their utility for behavioral studies, social simulation, and related applications. To address these deficiencies, in this work we introduce TinyTroupe, a simulation toolkit enabling detailed persona definitions (e.g., nationality, age, occupation, personality, beliefs, behaviors) and programmatic control via numerous LLM-driven mechanisms. This allows for the concise formulation of behavioral problems of practical interest, either at the individual or group level, and provides effective means for their solution. TinyTroupe's components are presented using representative working examples, such as brainstorming and market research sessions, thereby simultaneously clarifying their purpose and demonstrating their usefulness. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations of selected aspects are also provided, highlighting possibilities, limitations, and trade-offs. The approach, though realized as a specific Python implementation, is meant as a novel conceptual contribution, which can be partially or fully incorporated in other contexts. The library is available as open source at https://github.com/microsoft/tinytroupe.

Abstract: Software systems usually provide numerous configuration options that can affect performance metrics such as execution time, memory usage, binary size, or bitrate. On the one hand, making informed decisions is challenging and requires domain expertise in options and their combinations. On the other hand, machine learning techniques can search vast configuration spaces, but with a high computational cost, since concrete executions of numerous configurations are required. In this exploratory study, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can assist in performance-oriented software configuration through prompts. We evaluate several LLMs on tasks including identifying relevant options, ranking configurations, and recommending performant configurations across various configurable systems, such as compilers, video encoders, and SAT solvers. Our preliminary results reveal both positive abilities and notable limitations: depending on the task and systems, LLMs can well align with expert knowledge, whereas hallucinations or superficial reasoning can emerge in other cases. These findings represent a first step toward systematic evaluations and the design of LLM-based solutions to assist with software configuration.

Abstract: Computer-aided design (CAD) is the digital construction of 2D and 3D objects, and is central to a wide range of engineering and manufacturing applications like automobile and aviation. Despite its importance, CAD modeling remains largely a time-intensive, manual task. Recent works have attempted to automate this process with small transformer-based models and handcrafted CAD sequence representations. However, there has been little effort to leverage the potential of large language models (LLMs) for sequential CAD design. In this work, we introduce a new large-scale dataset of more than 170k CAD models annotated with high-quality, human-like descriptions generated with our pipeline based on GPT-4.1. Using this dataset, we fine-tune powerful code-LLMs to generate CAD sequences represented in a JSON-based format from natural language descriptions, demonstrating the viability and effectiveness of this approach for text-conditioned CAD generation. Because simple metrics often fail to reflect the quality of generated objects, we introduce geometric and topological metrics based on sphericity, mean curvature, and Euler characteristic to provide richer structural insights. Our experiments and ablation studies on both synthetic and human-annotated data demonstrate that CADmium is able to automate CAD design, drastically speeding up the design of new objects. The dataset, code, and fine-tuned models are available online.

Abstract: In traffic prediction, the goal is to estimate traffic speed or flow in specific regions or road segments using historical data collected by devices deployed in each area. Each region or road segment can be viewed as an individual client that measures local traffic flow, making Federated Learning (FL) a suitable approach for collaboratively training models without sharing raw data. In centralized FL, a central server collects and aggregates model updates from multiple clients to build a shared model while preserving each client's data privacy. Standard FL methods, such as Federated Averaging (FedAvg), assume that clients are independent, which can limit performance in traffic prediction tasks where spatial relationships between clients are important. Federated Graph Learning methods can capture these dependencies during server-side aggregation, but they often introduce significant computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a lightweight graph-aware FL approach that blends the simplicity of FedAvg with key ideas from graph learning. Rather than training full models, our method applies basic neighbourhood aggregation principles to guide parameter updates, weighting client models based on graph connectivity. This approach captures spatial relationships effectively while remaining computationally efficient. We evaluate our method on two benchmark traffic datasets, METR-LA and PEMS-BAY, and show that it achieves competitive performance compared to standard baselines and recent graph-based federated learning techniques.

Abstract: Neural networks are capable of superposition -- representing more features than there are dimensions. Recent work considers the analogous concept for computation instead of storage, proposing theoretical constructions. But there has been little investigation into whether these circuits can be learned in practice. In this work, we investigate a toy model for the Universal-AND problem which computes the AND of all $m\choose 2$ pairs of $m$ sparse inputs. The hidden dimension that determines the number of non-linear activations is restricted to pressure the model to find a compute-efficient circuit, called compressed computation. We find that the training process finds a simple solution that does not correspond to theoretical constructions. It is fully dense -- every neuron contributes to every output. The solution circuit naturally scales with dimension, trading off error rates for neuron efficiency. It is similarly robust to changes in sparsity and other key parameters, and extends naturally to other boolean operations and boolean circuits. We explain the found solution in detail and compute why it is more efficient than the theoretical constructions at low sparsity. Our findings shed light on the types of circuits that models like to form and the flexibility of the superposition representation. This contributes to a broader understanding of network circuitry and interpretability.

Abstract: Neural networks have achieved remarkable success in time series classification, but their reliance on large amounts of labeled data for training limits their applicability in cold-start scenarios. Moreover, they lack interpretability, reducing transparency in decision-making. In contrast, dynamic time warping (DTW) combined with a nearest neighbor classifier is widely used for its effectiveness in limited-data settings and its inherent interpretability. However, as a non-parametric method, it is not trainable and cannot leverage large amounts of labeled data, making it less effective than neural networks in rich-resource scenarios. In this work, we aim to develop a versatile model that adapts to cold-start conditions and becomes trainable with labeled data, while maintaining interpretability. We propose a dynamic length-shortening algorithm that transforms time series into prototypes while preserving key structural patterns, thereby enabling the reformulation of the DTW recurrence relation into an equivalent recurrent neural network. Based on this, we construct a trainable model that mimics DTW's alignment behavior. As a neural network, it becomes trainable when sufficient labeled data is available, while still retaining DTW's inherent interpretability. We apply the model to several benchmark time series classification tasks and observe that it significantly outperforms previous approaches in low-resource settings and remains competitive in rich-resource settings.

Abstract: Cognitive diagnosis (CD) models latent cognitive states of human learners by analyzing their response patterns on diagnostic tests, serving as a crucial machine learning technique for educational assessment and evaluation. Traditional cognitive diagnosis models typically follow a transductive prediction paradigm that optimizes parameters to fit response scores and extract learner abilities. These approaches face significant limitations as they cannot perform instant diagnosis for new learners without computationally expensive retraining and produce diagnostic outputs with limited reliability. In this study, we introduces a novel generative diagnosis paradigm that fundamentally shifts CD from predictive to generative modeling, enabling inductive inference of cognitive states without parameter re-optimization. We propose two simple yet effective instantiations of this paradigm: Generative Item Response Theory (G-IRT) and Generative Neural Cognitive Diagnosis Model (G-NCDM), which achieve excellent performance improvements over traditional methods. The generative approach disentangles cognitive state inference from response prediction through a well-designed generation process that incorporates identifiability and monotonicity conditions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology in addressing scalability and reliability challenges, especially $\times 100$ speedup for the diagnosis of new learners. Our framework opens new avenues for cognitive diagnosis applications in artificial intelligence, particularly for intelligent model evaluation and intelligent education systems. The code is available at https://github.com/CSLiJT/Generative-CD.git.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are becoming increasingly popular, with their applications now extending beyond just a mode of transportation to serving as mobile actuators of a traffic flow to control flow dynamics. This contrasts with traditional fixed-location actuators, such as traffic signals, and is referred to as Lagrangian traffic control. However, designing effective Lagrangian traffic control policies for AVs that generalize across traffic scenarios introduces a major challenge. Real-world traffic environments are highly diverse, and developing policies that perform robustly across such diverse traffic scenarios is challenging. It is further compounded by the joint complexity of the multi-agent nature of traffic systems, mixed motives among participants, and conflicting optimization objectives subject to strict physical and external constraints. To address these challenges, we introduce Multi-Residual Mixture of Expert Learning (MRMEL), a novel framework for Lagrangian traffic control that augments a given suboptimal nominal policy with a learned residual while explicitly accounting for the structure of the traffic scenario space. In particular, taking inspiration from residual reinforcement learning, MRMEL augments a suboptimal nominal AV control policy by learning a residual correction, but at the same time dynamically selects the most suitable nominal policy from a pool of nominal policies conditioned on the traffic scenarios and modeled as a mixture of experts. We validate MRMEL using a case study in cooperative eco-driving at signalized intersections in Atlanta, Dallas Fort Worth, and Salt Lake City, with real-world data-driven traffic scenarios. The results show that MRMEL consistently yields superior performance-achieving an additional 4%-9% reduction in aggregate vehicle emissions relative to the strongest baseline in each setting.

Abstract: Relational databases underpin critical infrastructure across a wide range of domains, yet the design of generalizable pre-training strategies for learning from relational databases remains an open challenge due to task heterogeneity. Specifically, there exist infinitely many possible downstream tasks, as tasks are defined based on relational schema graphs, temporal dependencies, and SQL-defined label logics. An effective pre-training framework is desired to take these factors into account in order to obtain task-aware representations. By incorporating knowledge of the underlying distribution that drives label generation, downstream tasks can benefit from relevant side-channel information. To bridge this gap, we introduce Task Vector Estimation (TVE), a novel pre-training framework that constructs predictive supervisory signals via set-based aggregation over schema traversal graphs, explicitly modeling next-window relational dynamics. We formalize our approach through an information-theoretic lens, demonstrating that task-informed representations retain more relevant signals than those obtained without task priors. Extensive experiments on the RelBench benchmark show that TVE consistently outperforms traditional pre-training baselines. Our findings advocate for pre-training objectives that encode task heterogeneity and temporal structure as design principles for predictive modeling on relational databases.

<title>Through the River: Understanding the Benefit of Schedule-Free Methods for Language Model Training</title>

Abstract: As both model and dataset sizes continue to scale rapidly, conventional pretraining strategies with fixed compute budgets-such as cosine learning rate schedules-are increasingly inadequate for large-scale training. Recent alternatives, including warmup-stable-decay (WSD) schedules and weight averaging, offer greater flexibility. However, WSD relies on explicit decay phases to track progress, while weight averaging addresses this limitation at the cost of additional memory. In search of a more principled and scalable alternative, we revisit the Schedule-Free (SF) method [Defazio et al., 2024], which has shown strong empirical performance across diverse settings. We show that SF-AdamW effectively navigates the "river" structure of the loss landscape without decay phases or auxiliary averaging, making it particularly suitable for continuously scaling training workloads. To understand this behavior, we conduct a theoretical and empirical analysis of SF dynamics, revealing that it implicitly performs weight averaging without memory overhead. Guided by this analysis, we propose a refined variant of SF that improves robustness to momentum and performs better under large batch sizes, addressing key limitations of the original method. Together, these results establish SF as a practical, scalable, and theoretically grounded approach for language model training.

Abstract: This paper aims to propose a novel machine learning (ML) approach incorporating Homomorphic Encryption (HE) to address privacy limitations in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)-based face detection. Due to challenges related to distance, altitude, and face orientation, high-resolution imagery and sophisticated neural networks enable accurate face recognition in dynamic environments. However, privacy concerns arise from the extensive surveillance capabilities of UAVs. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel framework that integrates HE with advanced neural networks to secure facial data throughout the inference phase. This method ensures that facial data remains secure with minimal impact on detection accuracy. Specifically, the proposed system leverages the Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) scheme to perform computations directly on encrypted data, optimizing computational efficiency and security. Furthermore, we develop an effective data encoding method specifically designed to preprocess the raw facial data into CKKS form in a Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data (SIMD) manner. Building on this, we design a secure inference algorithm to compute on ciphertext without needing decryption. This approach not only protects data privacy during the processing of facial data but also enhances the efficiency of UAV-based face detection systems. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively balances privacy protection and detection performance, making it a viable solution for UAV-based secure face detection. Significantly, our approach (while maintaining data confidentially with HE encryption) can still achieve an accuracy of less than 1% compared to the benchmark without using encryption.

Abstract: Visually-Rich Document Understanding (VRDU) has emerged as a critical field, driven by the need to automatically process documents containing complex visual, textual, and layout information. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable potential in this domain, leveraging both Optical Character Recognition (OCR)-dependent and OCR-free frameworks to extract and interpret information in document images. This survey reviews recent advancements in MLLM-based VRDU, highlighting three core components: (1) methods for encoding and fusing textual, visual, and layout features; (2) training paradigms, including pretraining strategies, instruction-response tuning, and the trainability of different model modules; and (3) datasets utilized for pretraining, instruction-tuning, and supervised fine-tuning. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities in this evolving field and propose future directions to advance the efficiency, generalizability, and robustness of VRDU systems.

Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a structured and interpretable alternative to Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based RL methods, with lower computational complexity and greater transparency. However, standard MPC-RL approaches often suffer from slow convergence, suboptimal policy learning due to limited parameterization, and safety issues during online adaptation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that integrates MPC-RL with Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO). The proposed MPC-RL-MOBO utilizes noisy evaluations of the RL stage cost and its gradient, estimated via a Compatible Deterministic Policy Gradient (CDPG) approach, and incorporates them into a MOBO algorithm using the Expected Hypervolume Improvement (EHVI) acquisition function. This fusion enables efficient and safe tuning of the MPC parameters to achieve improved closed-loop performance, even under model imperfections. A numerical example demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving sample-efficient, stable, and high-performance learning for control systems.

Abstract: Code large language models (LLMs) enhance programming by understanding and generating code across languages, offering intelligent feedback, bug detection, and code updates through reflection, improving development efficiency and accessibility. While benchmarks (e.g. HumanEval/LiveCodeBench) evaluate code generation and real-world relevance, previous works ignore the scenario of modifying code in repositories. Considering challenges remaining in improving reflection capabilities and avoiding data contamination in dynamic benchmarks, we introduce LiveRepoReflection, a challenging benchmark for evaluating code understanding and generation in multi-file repository contexts, featuring 1,888 rigorously filtered test cases across $6$ programming languages to ensure diversity, correctness, and high difficulty. Further, we create RepoReflection-Instruct, a large-scale, quality-filtered instruction-tuning dataset derived from diverse sources, used to train RepoReflectionCoder through a two-turn dialogue process involving code generation and error-driven repair. The leaderboard evaluates over 40 LLMs to reflect the model performance of repository-based code reflection.

Abstract: The grand goal of AI research, and particularly Self Supervised Learning (SSL), is to produce systems that can successfully solve any possible task. In contrast, current evaluation methods available to AI researchers typically rely on a fixed collection of hand-picked downstream benchmarks. Hence, a large amount of effort is put into designing and searching for large collection of evaluation tasks that can serve as a proxy of our grand goal. We argue that such a rigid evaluation protocol creates a silent bottleneck in AI research. To remedy that, we define a probabilistic space of downstream tasks obtained by adopting a distribution of tasks and by defining Task Priors. Under this view, one can evaluate a model's performance over the set of all possible downstream tasks. Our framework is the first to provide answers to key questions such as (i) what is the average performance of my model over all possible downstream tasks weighted by the probability to encounter each task? or (ii) what is the variance of my model's performance across all downstream tasks under the defined Task Priors? Beyond establishing a new standard for evaluation, we believe that Task Priors will accelerate the pace of research in SSL - where downstream task evaluation is the sole qualitative signal that researchers have access to.

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate the intriguing ability to perform unseen tasks via in-context learning. However, it remains unclear what mechanisms inside the model drive such task-level generalization. In this work, we approach this question through the lens of off-by-one addition (i.e., 1+1=3, 2+2=5, 3+3=?), a two-step, counterfactual task with an unexpected +1 function as a second step. Leveraging circuit-style interpretability techniques such as path patching, we analyze the models' internal computations behind their notable performance and present three key findings. First, we uncover a function induction mechanism that explains the model's generalization from standard addition to off-by-one addition. This mechanism resembles the structure of the induction head mechanism found in prior work and elevates it to a higher level of abstraction. Second, we show that the induction of the +1 function is governed by multiple attention heads in parallel, each of which emits a distinct piece of the +1 function. Finally, we find that this function induction mechanism is reused in a broader range of tasks, including synthetic tasks such as shifted multiple-choice QA and algorithmic tasks such as base-8 addition. Overall, our findings offer deeper insights into how reusable and composable structures within language models enable task-level generalization.

Abstract: Video understanding plays a vital role in bridging low-level visual signals with high-level cognitive reasoning, and is fundamental to applications such as autonomous driving, embodied AI, and the broader pursuit of AGI. The rapid development of large language models (LLMs), particularly those utilizing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technology, has significantly advanced video reasoning capabilities. However, current approaches primarily depend on textual information for reasoning, overlooking the visual modality in the actual video reasoning process. In contrast, humans naturally re-examine visual content while reasoning. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel video reasoning paradigm: Video-Text Interleaved CoT (ViTCoT), which facilitates more intuitive and cognitively aligned reasoning. To the end, first, we construct the Video-Text Interleaved Benchmark (ViTIB), which is created using MLLMs for key-video selection and manually verified. Furthermore, we extensively explore the potential of the ViTCoT paradigm in the video understanding field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViTCoT significantly enhances performance compared to the traditional text-only CoT paradigm and effectively activates more neuron values in MLLMs.

<title>Covering a Few Submodular Constraints and Applications</title>

Abstract: We consider the problem of covering multiple submodular constraints. Given a finite ground set $N$, a cost function $c: N \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$, $r$ monotone submodular functions $f_1,f_2,\ldots,f_r$ over $N$ and requirements $b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_r$ the goal is to find a minimum cost subset $S \subseteq N$ such that $f_i(S) \ge b_i$ for $1 \le i \le r$. When $r=1$ this is the well-known Submodular Set Cover problem. Previous work \cite{chekuri2022covering} considered the setting when $r$ is large and developed bi-criteria approximation algorithms, and approximation algorithms for the important special case when each $f_i$ is a weighted coverage function. These are fairly general models and capture several concrete and interesting problems as special cases. The approximation ratios for these problem are at least $\Omega(\log r)$ which is unavoidable when $r$ is part of the input. In this paper, motivated by some recent applications, we consider the problem when $r$ is a \emph{fixed constant} and obtain two main results. For covering multiple submodular constraints we obtain a randomized bi-criteria approximation algorithm that for any given integer $\alpha \ge 1$ outputs a set $S$ such that $f_i(S) \ge$ $(1-1/e^\alpha -\epsilon)b_i$ for each $i \in [r]$ and $\mathbb{E}[c(S)] \le (1+\epsilon)\alpha \cdot \sf{OPT}$. Second, when the $f_i$ are weighted coverage functions from a deletion-closed set system we obtain a $(1+\epsilon)$ $(\frac{e}{e-1})$ $(1+\beta)$-approximation where $\beta$ is the approximation ratio for the underlying set cover instances via the natural LP. These results show that one can obtain nearly as good an approximation for any fixed $r$ as what one would achieve for $r=1$. We mention some applications that follow easily from these general results and anticipate more in the future.

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an essential and effective tool for diagnosing heart diseases. However, its effectiveness can be compromised by noise or unavailability of one or more leads of the standard 12-lead recordings, resulting in diagnostic errors or uncertainty. To address these challenges, we propose TolerantECG, a foundation model for ECG signals that is robust to noise and capable of functioning with arbitrary subsets of the standard 12-lead ECG. TolerantECG training combines contrastive and self-supervised learning frameworks to jointly learn ECG signal representations alongside their corresponding knowledge-retrieval-based text report descriptions and corrupted or lead-missing signals. Comprehensive benchmarking results demonstrate that TolerantECG consistently ranks as the best or second-best performer across various ECG signal conditions and class levels in the PTB-XL dataset, and achieves the highest performance on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.

<title>NeuTSFlow: Modeling Continuous Functions Behind Time Series Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a fundamental task with broad applications, yet conventional methods often treat data as discrete sequences, overlooking their origin as noisy samples of continuous processes. Crucially, discrete noisy observations cannot uniquely determine a continuous function; instead, they correspond to a family of plausible functions. Mathematically, time series can be viewed as noisy observations of a continuous function family governed by a shared probability measure. Thus, the forecasting task can be framed as learning the transition from the historical function family to the future function family. This reframing introduces two key challenges: (1) How can we leverage discrete historical and future observations to learn the relationships between their underlying continuous functions? (2) How can we model the transition path in function space from the historical function family to the future function family? To address these challenges, we propose NeuTSFlow, a novel framework that leverages Neural Operators to facilitate flow matching for learning path of measure between historical and future function families. By parameterizing the velocity field of the flow in infinite-dimensional function spaces, NeuTSFlow moves beyond traditional methods that focus on dependencies at discrete points, directly modeling function-level features instead. Experiments on diverse forecasting tasks demonstrate NeuTSFlow's superior accuracy and robustness, validating the effectiveness of the function-family perspective.

Abstract: Clustering analysis is fundamental in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis for elucidating cellular heterogeneity and diversity. Recent graph-based scRNA-seq clustering methods, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), have significantly improved in tackling the challenges of high-dimension, high-sparsity, and frequent dropout events that lead to ambiguous cell population boundaries. However, their reliance on hard graph constructions derived from thresholded similarity matrices presents challenges:(i) The simplification of intercellular relationships into binary edges (0 or 1) by applying thresholds, which restricts the capture of continuous similarity features among cells and leads to significant information loss.(ii) The presence of significant inter-cluster connections within hard graphs, which can confuse GNN methods that rely heavily on graph structures, potentially causing erroneous message propagation and biased clustering outcomes. To tackle these challenges, we introduce scSGC, a Soft Graph Clustering for single-cell RNA sequencing data, which aims to more accurately characterize continuous similarities among cells through non-binary edge weights, thereby mitigating the limitations of rigid data structures. The scSGC framework comprises three core components: (i) a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB)-based feature autoencoder; (ii) a dual-channel cut-informed soft graph embedding module; and (iii) an optimal transport-based clustering optimization module. Extensive experiments across ten datasets demonstrate that scSGC outperforms 13 state-of-the-art clustering models in clustering accuracy, cell type annotation, and computational efficiency. These results highlight its substantial potential to advance scRNA-seq data analysis and deepen our understanding of cellular heterogeneity.

Abstract: Characterization of quantum systems from experimental data is a central problem in quantum science and technology. But which measurements should be used to gather data in the first place? While optimal measurement choices can be worked out for small quantum systems, the optimization becomes intractable as the system size grows large. To address this problem, we introduce a deep neural network with a sequence model architecture that searches for efficient measurement choices in a data-driven, adaptive manner. The model can be applied to a variety of tasks, including the prediction of linear and nonlinear properties of quantum states, as well as state clustering and state tomography tasks. In all these tasks, we find that the measurement choices identified by our neural network consistently outperform the uniformly random choice. Intriguingly, for topological quantum systems, our model tends to recommend measurements at the system's boundaries, even when the task is to predict bulk properties. This behavior suggests that the neural network may have independently discovered a connection between boundaries and bulk, without having been provided any built-in knowledge of quantum physics.

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of U-Net architectures integrated with various convolutional neural network (CNN) backbones for automated lung cancer detection and segmentation in chest CT images, addressing the critical need for accurate diagnostic tools in clinical settings. A balanced dataset of 832 chest CT images (416 cancerous and 416 non-cancerous) was preprocessed using Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and resized to 128x128 pixels. U-Net models were developed with three CNN backbones: ResNet50, VGG16, and Xception, to segment lung regions. After segmentation, CNN-based classifiers and hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional machine learning classifiers (Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting) were evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation. Metrics included accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Dice coefficient, and ROC-AUC. U-Net with ResNet50 achieved the best performance for cancerous lungs (Dice: 0.9495, Accuracy: 0.9735), while U-Net with VGG16 performed best for non-cancerous segmentation (Dice: 0.9532, Accuracy: 0.9513). For classification, the CNN model using U-Net with Xception achieved 99.1 percent accuracy, 99.74 percent recall, and 99.42 percent F1-score. The hybrid CNN-SVM-Xception model achieved 96.7 percent accuracy and 97.88 percent F1-score. Compared to prior methods, our framework consistently outperformed existing models. In conclusion, combining U-Net with advanced CNN backbones provides a powerful method for both segmentation and classification of lung cancer in CT scans, supporting early diagnosis and clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Many of society's most pressing challenges, from pandemic response to supply chain disruptions to climate adaptation, emerge from the collective behavior of millions of autonomous agents making decisions over time. Large Population Models (LPMs) offer an approach to understand these complex systems by simulating entire populations with realistic behaviors and interactions at unprecedented scale. LPMs extend traditional modeling approaches through three key innovations: computational methods that efficiently simulate millions of agents simultaneously, mathematical frameworks that learn from diverse real-world data streams, and privacy-preserving communication protocols that bridge virtual and physical environments. This allows researchers to observe how agent behavior aggregates into system-level outcomes and test interventions before real-world implementation. While current AI advances primarily focus on creating "digital humans" with sophisticated individual capabilities, LPMs develop "digital societies" where the richness of interactions reveals emergent phenomena. By bridging individual agent behavior and population-scale dynamics, LPMs offer a complementary path in AI research illuminating collective intelligence and providing testing grounds for policies and social innovations before real-world deployment. We discuss the technical foundations and some open problems here. LPMs are implemented by the AgentTorch framework (github.com/AgentTorch/AgentTorch)

Abstract: Continually updating model-based indexes in generative retrieval with new documents remains challenging, as full retraining is computationally expensive and impractical under resource constraints. We propose MixLoRA-DSI, a novel framework that combines an expandable mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation experts with a layer-wise out-of-distribution (OOD)-driven expansion strategy. Instead of allocating new experts for each new corpus, our proposed expansion strategy enables sublinear parameter growth by selectively introducing new experts only when significant number of OOD documents are detected. Experiments on NQ320k and MS MARCO Passage demonstrate that MixLoRA-DSI outperforms full-model update baselines, with minimal parameter overhead and substantially lower training costs.

Abstract: This work investigates speech enhancement (SE) from the perspective of language models (LMs). We propose a novel method that leverages Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve the perceptual quality of enhanced speech. Using UTMOS, a neural MOS prediction model, as a proxy for human ratings, our approach guides optimization toward perceptually preferred outputs. This differs from existing LM-based SE methods that focus on maximizing the likelihood of clean speech tokens, which may misalign with human perception and degrade quality despite low prediction error. Experiments on the 2020 Deep Noise Suppression Challenge test sets demonstrate that applying DPO to a pretrained LM-based SE model yields consistent improvements across various speech quality metrics, with relative gains of up to 56%. To our knowledge, this is the first application of DPO to SE and the first to incorporate proxy perceptual feedback into LM-based SE training, pointing to a promising direction for perceptually aligned SE.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into safety-critical domains, such as nuclear engineering, necessitates a deep understanding of their internal reasoning processes. This paper presents a novel methodology for interpreting how an LLM encodes and utilizes domain-specific knowledge, using a Boiling Water Reactor system as a case study. We adapted a general-purpose LLM (Gemma-3-1b-it) to the nuclear domain using a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique known as Low-Rank Adaptation. By comparing the neuron activation patterns of the base model to those of the fine-tuned model, we identified a sparse set of neurons whose behavior was significantly altered during the adaptation process. To probe the causal role of these specialized neurons, we employed a neuron silencing technique. Our results demonstrate that while silencing most of these specialized neurons individually did not produce a statistically significant effect, deactivating the entire group collectively led to a statistically significant degradation in task performance. Qualitative analysis further revealed that silencing these neurons impaired the model's ability to generate detailed, contextually accurate technical information. This paper provides a concrete methodology for enhancing the transparency of an opaque black-box model, allowing domain expertise to be traced to verifiable neural circuits. This offers a pathway towards achieving nuclear-grade artificial intelligence (AI) assurance, addressing the verification and validation challenges mandated by nuclear regulatory frameworks (e.g., 10 CFR 50 Appendix B), which have limited AI deployment in safety-critical nuclear operations.

<title>Enhancing Retrieval Augmented Generation with Hierarchical Text Segmentation Chunking</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly use chunking strategies for retrieval, which enhance large language models (LLMs) by enabling them to access external knowledge, ensuring that the retrieved information is up-to-date and domain-specific. However, traditional methods often fail to create chunks that capture sufficient semantic meaning, as they do not account for the underlying textual structure. This paper proposes a novel framework that enhances RAG by integrating hierarchical text segmentation and clustering to generate more meaningful and semantically coherent chunks. During inference, the framework retrieves information by leveraging both segment-level and cluster-level vector representations, thereby increasing the likelihood of retrieving more precise and contextually relevant information. Evaluations on the NarrativeQA, QuALITY, and QASPER datasets indicate that the proposed method achieved improved results compared to traditional chunking techniques.

Abstract: Large language models are susceptible to memorizing repeated sequences, posing privacy and copyright concerns. A popular mitigation strategy is to remove memorized information from specific neurons post-hoc. However, such approaches have shown limited success so far. In a controlled setting, we show that the memorization of natural sequences (those that resemble linguistically plausible text) become mechanistically entangled with general language abilities, thereby becoming challenging to remove post-hoc. In this work, we put forward a new paradigm of MemSinks that promotes isolation of memorization by design. We leverage a sequence identifier that activates a unique set of memorization neurons for each sequence across repetitions. By analyzing the dynamics of learning and forgetting, we argue that MemSinks facilitates isolation of memorized content, making it easier to remove without compromising general language capabilities. We implement MemSinks at the billion-parameter and billion-token scale, and observe both effective isolation and strong generalization. To our knowledge, this is the first proof-of-concept on real data demonstrating that simultaneous generalization and isolation is achievable. We open-source our code at http://github.com/grghosal/MemSinks.

Abstract: The fashion retail business is centered around the capacity to comprehend products. Product attribution helps in comprehending products depending on the business process. Quality attribution improves the customer experience as they navigate through millions of products offered by a retail website. It leads to well-organized product catalogs. In the end, product attribution directly impacts the 'discovery experience' of the customer. Although large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in understanding multimodal data, their performance on fine-grained fashion attribute recognition remains under-explored. This paper presents a zero-shot evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs that balance performance with speed and cost efficiency, mainly GPT-4o-mini and Gemini 2.0 Flash. We have used the dataset DeepFashion-MultiModal (https://github.com/yumingj/DeepFashion-MultiModal) to evaluate these models in the attribution tasks of fashion products. Our study evaluates these models across 18 categories of fashion attributes, offering insight into where these models excel. We only use images as the sole input for product information to create a constrained environment. Our analysis shows that Gemini 2.0 Flash demonstrates the strongest overall performance with a macro F1 score of 56.79% across all attributes, while GPT-4o-mini scored a macro F1 score of 43.28%. Through detailed error analysis, our findings provide practical insights for deploying these LLMs in production e-commerce product attribution-related tasks and highlight the need for domain-specific fine-tuning approaches. This work also lays the groundwork for future research in fashion AI and multimodal attribute extraction.

Abstract: Precise segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for neuro-oncology diagnosis and treatment planning. Despite advances in deep learning methods, automatic segmentation remains challenging due to tumor morphological heterogeneity and complex three-dimensional spatial relationships. Current techniques primarily rely on visual features extracted from MRI sequences while underutilizing semantic knowledge embedded in medical reports. This research presents a multi-level fusion architecture that integrates pixel-level, feature-level, and semantic-level information, facilitating comprehensive processing from low-level data to high-level concepts. The semantic-level fusion pathway combines the semantic understanding capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models with the spatial feature extraction advantages of 3D U-Net through three mechanisms: 3D-2D semantic bridging, cross-modal semantic guidance, and semantic-based attention mechanisms. Experimental validation on the BraTS 2020 dataset demonstrates that the proposed model achieves an overall Dice coefficient of 0.8567, representing a 4.8% improvement compared to traditional 3D U-Net, with a 7.3% Dice coefficient increase in the clinically important enhancing tumor (ET) region.

Abstract: Large decoder-based language models have become the dominant architecture for reward modeling in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, as reward models are increasingly deployed in test-time strategies, their inference costs become a growing concern. We present TinyRM, a family of small, bidirectional masked language models (MLMs) with as few as 400 million parameters, that rival the capabilities of models over 175 times larger on reasoning and safety preference modeling tasks. TinyRM combines FLAN-style prompting, Directional Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA), and layer freezing to achieve strong performance on RewardBench, despite using significantly fewer resources. Our experiments suggest that small models benefit from domain-specific tuning strategies, particularly in reasoning, where lightweight finetuning methods are especially effective. While challenges remain in building generalist models and conversational preference modeling, our preliminary results highlight the promise of lightweight bidirectional architectures as efficient, scalable alternatives for preference modeling.

Abstract: Touch is recognized as a vital sense for humans and an equally important modality for robots, especially for dexterous manipulation, material identification, and scenarios involving visual occlusion. Building upon very recent work in touch foundation models, this demonstration will feature Octopi-1.5, our latest visual-tactile-language model. Compared to its predecessor, Octopi-1.5 introduces the ability to process tactile signals from multiple object parts and employs a simple retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module to improve performance on tasks and potentially learn new objects on-the-fly. The system can be experienced live through a new handheld tactile-enabled interface, the TMI, equipped with GelSight and TAC-02 tactile sensors. This convenient and accessible setup allows users to interact with Octopi-1.5 without requiring a robot. During the demonstration, we will showcase Octopi-1.5 solving tactile inference tasks by leveraging tactile inputs and commonsense knowledge. For example, in a Guessing Game, Octopi-1.5 will identify objects being grasped and respond to follow-up queries about how to handle it (e.g., recommending careful handling for soft fruits). We also plan to demonstrate Octopi-1.5's RAG capabilities by teaching it new items. With live interactions, this demonstration aims to highlight both the progress and limitations of VTLMs such as Octopi-1.5 and to foster further interest in this exciting field. Code for Octopi-1.5 and design files for the TMI gripper are available at https://github.com/clear-nus/octopi-1.5.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) typically require fine-tuning for domain-specific tasks, and LoRA offers a computationally efficient approach by training low-rank adapters. LoRA is also communication-efficient for federated LLMs when multiple users collaboratively fine-tune a global LLM model without sharing their proprietary raw data. However, even the transmission of local adapters between a server and clients risks serious privacy leakage. Applying differential privacy (DP) to federated LoRA encounters a dilemma: adding noise to both adapters amplifies synthetic noise on the model, while fixing one adapter impairs the learnability of fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose FedASK (Differentially Private Federated Low Rank Adaptation with Double Sketching) , a novel federated LoRA framework to enable effective updating of both low-rank adapters with robust differential privacy. Inspired by randomized SVD, our key idea is a two-stage sketching pipeline. This pipeline first aggregates carefully sketched, privacy-preserving local updates, and then reconstructs the global matrices on the server to facilitate effective updating of both adapters. We theoretically prove FedASK's differential privacy guarantee and its exact aggregation property. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FedASK consistently outperforms baseline methods across a variety of privacy settings and data distributions.

Abstract: Fear is a critical brain function for detecting danger and learning to avoid specific stimuli that can lead to danger. While fear is believed to have evolved under pressure from predators, experimentally reproducing the evolution is challenging. To investigate the relationship between environmental conditions, the evolution of fear, and the evolution of other rewards, such as food reward and social reward, we developed a distributed evolutionary simulation. In our simulation, prey and predator agents co-evolve their innate reward functions, including a possibly fear-like term for observing predators, and learn behaviors via reinforcement learning. Surprisingly, our simulation revealed that social reward for observing the same species is more important for prey to survive, and fear-like negative reward for observing predators evolves only after acquiring social reward. We also found that the predator with increased hunting ability (larger mouth) amplified fear emergence, but also that fear evolution is more stable with non-evolving predators that are bad at chasing prey. Additionally, unlike for predators, we found that positive rewards evolve in opposition to fear for stationary threats, as areas with abundant leftover food develop around them. These findings suggest that fear and social reward have had a complex interplay with each other through evolution, along with the nature of predators and threats.

Abstract: Foundation multi-modal models are often designed by stitching of multiple existing pretrained uni-modal models: for example, an image classifier with an autoregressive text model. This stitching process is performed by training a connector module that aims to align the representation-representation or representation-input spaces of these uni-modal models. However, given the complexity of training such connectors on large scale web-based datasets coupled with the ever-increasing number of available pretrained uni-modal models, the task of uni-modal models selection and subsequent connector module training becomes computationally demanding. To address this under-studied critical problem, we propose Hypernetwork Model Alignment (Hyma), a novel all-in-one solution for optimal uni-modal model selection and connector training by leveraging hypernetworks. Specifically, our framework utilizes the parameter prediction capability of a hypernetwork to obtain jointly trained connector modules for $N \times M$ combinations of uni-modal models. In our experiments, Hyma reduces the optimal uni-modal model pair search cost by $10\times$ (averaged across all experiments), while matching the ranking and trained connector performance obtained via grid search across a suite of diverse multi-modal benchmarks.

Abstract: Poultry farming is a vital component of the global food supply chain, yet it remains highly vulnerable to infectious diseases such as coccidiosis, salmonellosis, and Newcastle disease. This study proposes a lightweight machine learning-based approach to detect these diseases by analyzing poultry fecal images. We utilize multi-color space feature extraction (RGB, HSV, LAB) and explore a wide range of color, texture, and shape-based descriptors, including color histograms, local binary patterns (LBP), wavelet transforms, and edge detectors. Through a systematic ablation study and dimensionality reduction using PCA and XGBoost feature selection, we identify a compact global feature set that balances accuracy and computational efficiency. An artificial neural network (ANN) classifier trained on these features achieved 95.85% accuracy while requiring no GPU and only 638 seconds of execution time in Google Colab. Compared to deep learning models such as Xception and MobileNetV3, our proposed model offers comparable accuracy with drastically lower resource usage. This work demonstrates a cost-effective, interpretable, and scalable alternative to deep learning for real-time poultry disease detection in low-resource agricultural settings.

Abstract: Scientific paper retrieval, particularly framed as document-to-document retrieval, aims to identify relevant papers in response to a long-form query paper, rather than a short query string. Previous approaches to this task have focused on abstracts, embedding them into dense vectors as surrogates for full documents and calculating similarity across them, although abstracts provide only sparse and high-level summaries. To address this, we propose PRISM, a novel document-to-document retrieval method that introduces multiple, fine-grained representations for both the query and candidate papers. In particular, each query paper is decomposed into multiple aspect-specific views and individually embedded, which are then matched against candidate papers similarity segmented to consider their multifaceted dimensions. Moreover, we present SciFullBench, a novel benchmark in which the complete and segmented context of full papers for both queries and candidates is available. Then, experimental results show that PRISM improves performance by an average of 4.3% over existing retrieval baselines.

Abstract: Are AI systems truly representing human values, or merely averaging across them? Our study suggests a concerning reality: Large Language Models (LLMs) fail to represent diverse cultural moral frameworks despite their linguistic capabilities. We expose significant gaps between AI-generated and human moral intuitions by applying the Moral Foundations Questionnaire across 19 cultural contexts. Comparing multiple state-of-the-art LLMs' origins against human baseline data, we find these models systematically homogenize moral diversity. Surprisingly, increased model size doesn't consistently improve cultural representation fidelity. Our findings challenge the growing use of LLMs as synthetic populations in social science research and highlight a fundamental limitation in current AI alignment approaches. Without data-driven alignment beyond prompting, these systems cannot capture the nuanced, culturally-specific moral intuitions. Our results call for more grounded alignment objectives and evaluation metrics to ensure AI systems represent diverse human values rather than flattening the moral landscape.

<title>TGLD: A Trust-Aware Game-Theoretic Lane-Changing Decision Framework for Automated Vehicles in Heterogeneous Traffic</title>

Abstract: Automated vehicles (AVs) face a critical need to adopt socially compatible behaviors and cooperate effectively with human-driven vehicles (HVs) in heterogeneous traffic environment. However, most existing lane-changing frameworks overlook HVs' dynamic trust levels, limiting their ability to accurately predict human driver behaviors. To address this gap, this study proposes a trust-aware game-theoretic lane-changing decision (TGLD) framework. First, we formulate a multi-vehicle coalition game, incorporating fully cooperative interactions among AVs and partially cooperative behaviors from HVs informed by real-time trust evaluations. Second, we develop an online trust evaluation method to dynamically estimate HVs' trust levels during lane-changing interactions, guiding AVs to select context-appropriate cooperative maneuvers. Lastly, social compatibility objectives are considered by minimizing disruption to surrounding vehicles and enhancing the predictability of AV behaviors, thereby ensuring human-friendly and context-adaptive lane-changing strategies. A human-in-the-loop experiment conducted in a highway on-ramp merging scenario validates our TGLD approach. Results show that AVs can effectively adjust strategies according to different HVs' trust levels and driving styles. Moreover, incorporating a trust mechanism significantly improves lane-changing efficiency, maintains safety, and contributes to transparent and adaptive AV-HV interactions.

<title>Enhancing Chain-of-Thought Reasoning with Critical Representation Fine-tuning</title>

Abstract: Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT), a recently proposed Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method, has attracted widespread attention for significantly improving parameter efficiency by editing representation space alone. In this work, we investigate applying ReFT to complex reasoning tasks. However, directly using the native ReFT method, which modifies fixed representations at the beginning and end of each layer, yields suboptimal performance, as these fixed-position representations have uncertain impact on the outputs. We observe that, in complex reasoning tasks, there often exist certain critical representations. These representations either integrate significant information from preceding layers or regulate subsequent layer representations. Through layer-by-layer propagation, they exert a substantial influence on the final output. Naturally, fine-tuning these critical representations has the potential to greatly enhance reasoning performance. Building upon these insights, we propose Critical Representation Fine-Tuning (CRFT), a novel method that identifies and optimizes these critical representations through information flow analysis. CRFT operates within a supervised learning framework, dynamically optimizing critical representations in a low-rank linear subspace while freezing the base model. The effectiveness and efficiency of our method are validated across eight benchmarks for arithmetic and commonsense reasoning, using LLaMA and Mistral model families. Furthermore, our method also adapts effectively to few-shot settings, boosting one-shot accuracy by 16.4%. Our work highlights the untapped potential of representation-level optimization for CoT reasoning, offering a lightweight yet powerful alternative to traditional PEFT methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we study a second-order approach to policy optimization in reinforcement learning. Existing second-order methods often suffer from suboptimal sample complexity or rely on unrealistic assumptions about importance sampling. To overcome these limitations, we propose VR-CR-PN, a variance-reduced cubic-regularized policy Newton algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that integrates Hessian-aided variance reduction with second-order policy optimization, effectively addressing the distribution shift problem and achieving best-known sample complexity under general nonconvex conditions but without the need for importance sampling. We theoretically establish that VR-CR-PN achieves a sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-3})$ to reach an $\epsilon$-second-order stationary point, significantly improving upon the previous best result of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-3.5})$ under comparable assumptions. As an additional contribution, we introduce a novel Hessian estimator for the expected return function, which admits a uniform upper bound independent of the horizon length $H$, allowing the algorithm to achieve horizon-independent sample complexity.

Abstract: Accurate motion estimation for tracking deformable tissues in echocardiography is essential for precise cardiac function measurements. While traditional methods like block matching or optical flow struggle with intricate cardiac motion, modern point tracking approaches remain largely underexplored in this domain. This work investigates the potential of state-of-the-art (SOTA) point tracking methods for ultrasound, with a focus on echocardiography. Although these novel approaches demonstrate strong performance in general videos, their effectiveness and generalizability in echocardiography remain limited. By analyzing cardiac motion throughout the heart cycle in real B-mode ultrasound videos, we identify that a directional motion bias across different views is affecting the existing training strategies. To mitigate this, we refine the training procedure and incorporate a set of tailored augmentations to reduce the bias and enhance tracking robustness and generalization through impartial cardiac motion. We also propose a lightweight network leveraging multi-scale cost volumes from spatial context alone to challenge the advanced spatiotemporal point tracking models. Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning with our strategies significantly improves models' performances over their baselines, even for out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. For instance, EchoTracker boosts overall position accuracy by 60.7% and reduces median trajectory error by 61.5% across heart cycle phases. Interestingly, several point tracking models fail to outperform our proposed simple model in terms of tracking accuracy and generalization, reflecting their limitations when applied to echocardiography. Nevertheless, clinical evaluation reveals that these methods improve GLS measurements, aligning more closely with expert-validated, semi-automated tools and thus demonstrating better reproducibility in real-world applications.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of energy demand and supply is critical for optimizing sustainable energy systems, yet it is challenged by the variability of renewable sources and dynamic consumption patterns. This paper introduces a neural framework that integrates continuous-time Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), graph attention, multi-resolution wavelet transformations, and adaptive learning of frequencies to address the issues of time series prediction. The model employs a robust ODE solver, using the Runge-Kutta method, paired with graph-based attention and residual connections to better understand both structural and temporal patterns. Through wavelet-based feature extraction and adaptive frequency modulation, it adeptly captures and models diverse, multi-scale temporal dynamics. When evaluated across seven diverse datasets: ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2 (electricity transformer temperature), and Waste, Solar, and Hydro (renewable energy), this architecture consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various forecasting metrics, proving its robustness in capturing complex temporal dependencies. Furthermore, the model enhances interpretability through SHAP analysis, making it suitable for sustainable energy applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new defeasible version of propositional standpoint logic by integrating Kraus et al.'s defeasible conditionals, Britz and Varzinczak's notions of defeasible necessity and distinct possibility, along with Leisegang et al.'s approach to defeasibility into the standpoint logics of G\'omez \'Alvarez and Rudolph. The resulting logical framework allows for the expression of defeasibility on the level of implications, standpoint modal operators, and standpoint-sharpening statements. We provide a preferential semantics for this extended language and propose a tableaux calculus, which is shown to be sound and complete with respect to preferential entailment. We also establish the computational complexity of the tableaux procedure to be in PSpace.

Abstract: Innate resistance to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy remains a major clinical challenge in metastatic melanoma, with the underlying molecular networks being poorly understood. To address this, we constructed a dynamic Probabilistic Boolean Network model using transcriptomic data from patient tumor biopsies to elucidate the regulatory logic governing therapy response. We then employed a reinforcement learning agent to systematically discover optimal, multi-step therapeutic interventions and used explainable artificial intelligence to mechanistically interpret the agent's control policy. The analysis revealed that a precisely timed, 4-step temporary inhibition of the lysyl oxidase like 2 protein (LOXL2) was the most effective strategy. Our explainable analysis showed that this ``hit-and-run" intervention is sufficient to erase the molecular signature driving resistance, allowing the network to self-correct without requiring sustained intervention. This study presents a novel, time-dependent therapeutic hypothesis for overcoming immunotherapy resistance and provides a powerful computational framework for identifying non-obvious intervention protocols in complex biological systems.

Abstract: Play style identification can provide valuable game design insights and enable adaptive experiences, with the potential to improve game playing agents. Previous work relies on domain knowledge to construct play trace representations using handcrafted features. More recent approaches incorporate the sequential structure of play traces but still require some level of domain abstraction. In this study, we explore the use of unsupervised CNN-LSTM autoencoder models to obtain latent representations directly from low-level play trace data in MicroRTS. We demonstrate that this approach yields a meaningful separation of different game playing agents in the latent space, reducing reliance on domain expertise and its associated biases. This latent space is then used to guide the exploration of diverse play styles within studied AI players.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in natural language processing tasks, their effectiveness in the classification and transformation of abusive text into non-abusive versions remains an area for exploration. In this study, we aim to use LLMs to transform abusive text (tweets and reviews) featuring hate speech and swear words into non-abusive text, while retaining the intent of the text. We evaluate the performance of two state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Gemini, GPT-4o, DeekSeek and Groq, on their ability to identify abusive text. We them to transform and obtain a text that is clean from abusive and inappropriate content but maintains a similar level of sentiment and semantics, i.e. the transformed text needs to maintain its message. Afterwards, we evaluate the raw and transformed datasets with sentiment analysis and semantic analysis. Our results show Groq provides vastly different results when compared with other LLMs. We have identified similarities between GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3.

Abstract: Formal specifications are essential for ensuring software correctness, yet manually writing them is tedious and error-prone. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating such specifications from natural language intents, but the giant model size and high computational demands raise a fundamental question: Do we really need large models for this task? In this paper, we show that a small, fine-tuned language model can achieve high-quality postcondition generation with much lower computational costs. We construct a specialized dataset of prompts, reasoning logs, and postconditions, then supervise the fine-tuning of a $7$B-parameter code model. Our approach tackles real-world repository dependencies and preserves pre-state information, allowing for expressive and accurate specifications. We evaluate the model on a benchmark of real-world Java bugs (Defects4J) and compare against both proprietary giants (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-source large models. Empirical results demonstrate that our compact model matches or outperforms significantly larger counterparts in syntax correctness, semantic correctness, and bug-distinguishing capability. These findings highlight that targeted fine-tuning on a modest dataset can enable small models to achieve results formerly seen only in massive, resource-heavy LLMs, offering a practical and efficient path for the real-world adoption of automated specification generation.

We showcase feasibility on multiple benchmarks. The results suggest high target utility at moderate privacy leakage.

Abstract: Natural language-based assessment (NLA) is an approach to second language assessment that uses instructions - expressed in the form of can-do descriptors - originally intended for human examiners, aiming to determine whether large language models (LLMs) can interpret and apply them in ways comparable to human assessment. In this work, we explore the use of such descriptors with an open-source LLM, Qwen 2.5 72B, to assess responses from the publicly available S&amp;I Corpus in a zero-shot setting. Our results show that this approach - relying solely on textual information - achieves competitive performance: while it does not outperform state-of-the-art speech LLMs fine-tuned for the task, it surpasses a BERT-based model trained specifically for this purpose. NLA proves particularly effective in mismatched task settings, is generalisable to other data types and languages, and offers greater interpretability, as it is grounded in clearly explainable, widely applicable language descriptors.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in vision-language understanding, reasoning, and generation. However, they struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained localization and reasoning in high-resolution images. This constraint stems from the fact that MLLMs are fine-tuned with fixed image resolution to align with the pre-trained image encoder used in MLLM. Consequently, feeding high-resolution images directly into MLLMs leads to poor generalization due to a train-test resolution discrepancy, while downsampling these images-although ensuring consistency-compromises fine-grained visual details and ultimately degrades performance. To address this challenge, we propose Extract Candidate then Predict (ECP), a novel training-free, task-agnostic two-stage framework designed to enhance MLLM performance on high-resolution images. The key intuition behind ECP is that while MLLMs struggle with high-resolution images, their predictions on downsampled images still contain implicit localization cues. By first identifying candidate region using the coarse prediction and then predicting the final output based on candidate region, ECP effectively preserves fine-grained details while mitigating the challenges posed by high-resolution data. We validate our framework on 4K GUI grounding and 4K, 8K MLLM perception, achieving +21.3%, +5.8%, +5.2% absolute improvement compared to baseline respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness. Code is available at https://github.com/yenncye/ECP.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly central to Arabic NLP applications, evaluating their understanding of regional dialects and cultural nuances is essential, particularly in linguistically diverse settings like Saudi Arabia. This paper introduces \texttt{Absher}, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs performance across major Saudi dialects. \texttt{Absher} comprises over 18,000 multiple-choice questions spanning six distinct categories: Meaning, True/False, Fill-in-the-Blank, Contextual Usage, Cultural Interpretation, and Location Recognition. These questions are derived from a curated dataset of dialectal words, phrases, and proverbs sourced from various regions of Saudi Arabia. We evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs, including multilingual and Arabic-specific models. We also provide detailed insights into their capabilities and limitations. Our results reveal notable performance gaps, particularly in tasks requiring cultural inference or contextual understanding. Our findings highlight the urgent need for dialect-aware training and culturally aligned evaluation methodologies to improve LLMs performance in real-world Arabic applications.

Abstract: Prosthetic legs play a pivotal role in clinical rehabilitation, allowing individuals with lower-limb amputations the ability to regain mobility and improve their quality of life. Gait analysis is fundamental for optimizing prosthesis design and alignment, directly impacting the mobility and life quality of individuals with lower-limb amputations. Vision-based machine learning (ML) methods offer a scalable and non-invasive solution to gait analysis, but face challenges in correctly detecting and analyzing prosthesis, due to their unique appearances and new movement patterns. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by introducing a multi-purpose dataset, namely ProGait, to support multiple vision tasks including Video Object Segmentation, 2D Human Pose Estimation, and Gait Analysis (GA). ProGait provides 412 video clips from four above-knee amputees when testing multiple newly-fitted prosthetic legs through walking trials, and depicts the presence, contours, poses, and gait patterns of human subjects with transfemoral prosthetic legs. Alongside the dataset itself, we also present benchmark tasks and fine-tuned baseline models to illustrate the practical application and performance of the ProGait dataset. We compared our baseline models against pre-trained vision models, demonstrating improved generalizability when applying the ProGait dataset for prosthesis-specific tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/pittisl/ProGait and dataset at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ericyxy98/ProGait.

Abstract: Our society increasingly depends on intelligent systems to solve complex problems, ranging from recommender systems suggesting the next movie to watch to AI models assisting in medical diagnoses for hospitalized patients. With the iterative improvement of diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, AI holds significant potential to mitigate medical misdiagnoses by preventing numerous deaths and reducing an economic burden of approximately 450 EUR billion annually. However, a key obstacle to AI adoption lies in the lack of transparency: many automated systems function as "black boxes," providing predictions without revealing the underlying processes. This opacity can hinder experts' ability to trust and rely on AI systems. Visual analytics (VA) provides a compelling solution by combining AI models with interactive visualizations. These specialized charts and graphs empower users to incorporate their domain expertise to refine and improve the models, bridging the gap between AI and human understanding. In this work, we define, categorize, and explore how VA solutions can foster trust across the stages of a typical AI pipeline. We propose a design space for innovative visualizations and present an overview of our previously developed VA dashboards, which support critical tasks within the various pipeline stages, including data processing, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, understanding, debugging, refining, and comparing models.

Abstract: Accurate and timely cancer diagnosis from histopathological slides is vital for effective clinical decision-making. This paper introduces DepViT-CAD, a deployable AI system for multi-class cancer diagnosis in histopathology. At its core is MAViT, a novel Multi-Attention Vision Transformer designed to capture fine-grained morphological patterns across diverse tumor types. MAViT was trained on expert-annotated patches from 1008 whole-slide images, covering 11 diagnostic categories, including 10 major cancers and non-tumor tissue. DepViT-CAD was validated on two independent cohorts: 275 WSIs from The Cancer Genome Atlas and 50 routine clinical cases from pathology labs, achieving diagnostic sensitivities of 94.11% and 92%, respectively. By combining state-of-the-art transformer architecture with large-scale real-world validation, DepViT-CAD offers a robust and scalable approach for AI-assisted cancer diagnostics. To support transparency and reproducibility, software and code will be made publicly available at GitHub.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance in vision-language tasks. However, existing MLLMs are primarily trained on generic datasets, limiting their ability to reason on domain-specific visual cues such as those in facial images. In particular, tasks that require detailed understanding of facial structure, expression, emotion, and demographic features remain underexplored by MLLMs due to the lack of large-scale annotated face image-text datasets. In this work, we introduce FaceLLM, a multimodal large language model trained specifically for facial image understanding. To construct the training data, we propose a novel weakly supervised pipeline that uses ChatGPT with attribute-aware prompts to generate high-quality question-answer pairs based on images from the FairFace dataset. The resulting corpus, called FairFaceGPT, covers a diverse set of attributes including expression, pose, skin texture, and forensic information. Our experiments demonstrate that FaceLLM improves the performance of MLLMs on various face-centric tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This work highlights the potential of synthetic supervision via language models for building domain-specialized MLLMs, and sets a precedent for trustworthy, human-centric multimodal AI systems. FairFaceGPT dataset and pretrained FaceLLM models are publicly available in the project page.

Abstract: Early detection of dementia is critical for timely medical intervention and improved patient outcomes. Neuropsychological tests are widely used for cognitive assessment but have traditionally relied on manual scoring. Automatic dementia classification (ADC) systems aim to infer cognitive decline directly from speech recordings of such tests. We propose Demenba, a novel ADC framework based on state space models, which scale linearly in memory and computation with sequence length. Trained on over 1,000 hours of cognitive assessments administered to Framingham Heart Study participants, some of whom were diagnosed with dementia through adjudicated review, our method outperforms prior approaches in fine-grained dementia classification by 21\%, while using fewer parameters. We further analyze its scaling behavior and demonstrate that our model gains additional improvement when fused with large language models, paving the way for more transparent and scalable dementia assessment tools.

Abstract: Interaction-Oriented Programming (IOP) is an approach to building a multiagent system by modeling the interactions between its roles via a flexible interaction protocol and implementing agents to realize the interactions of the roles they play in the protocol.
  In recent years, we have developed an extensive suite of software that enables multiagent system developers to apply IOP. These include tools for efficiently verifying protocols for properties such as liveness and safety and middleware that simplifies the implementation of agents. This paper presents some of that software suite.

<title>Feature Distillation is the Better Choice for Model-Heterogeneous Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Model-Heterogeneous Federated Learning (Hetero-FL) has attracted growing attention for its ability to aggregate knowledge from heterogeneous models while keeping private data locally. To better aggregate knowledge from clients, ensemble distillation, as a widely used and effective technique, is often employed after global aggregation to enhance the performance of the global model. However, simply combining Hetero-FL and ensemble distillation does not always yield promising results and can make the training process unstable. The reason is that existing methods primarily focus on logit distillation, which, while being model-agnostic with softmax predictions, fails to compensate for the knowledge bias arising from heterogeneous models. To tackle this challenge, we propose a stable and efficient Feature Distillation for model-heterogeneous Federated learning, dubbed FedFD, that can incorporate aligned feature information via orthogonal projection to integrate knowledge from heterogeneous models better. Specifically, a new feature-based ensemble federated knowledge distillation paradigm is proposed. The global model on the server needs to maintain a projection layer for each client-side model architecture to align the features separately. Orthogonal techniques are employed to re-parameterize the projection layer to mitigate knowledge bias from heterogeneous models and thus maximize the distilled knowledge. Extensive experiments show that FedFD achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Multi-horizon time series forecasting has many practical applications such as demand forecasting. Accurate demand prediction is critical to help make buying and inventory decisions for supply chain management of e-commerce and physical retailers, and such predictions are typically required for future horizons extending tens of weeks. This is especially challenging during high-stake sales events when demand peaks are particularly difficult to predict accurately. However, these events are important not only for managing supply chain operations but also for ensuring a seamless shopping experience for customers. To address this challenge, we propose Temporal-Aligned Transformer (TAT), a multi-horizon forecaster leveraging apriori-known context variables such as holiday and promotion events information for improving predictive performance. Our model consists of an encoder and decoder, both embedded with a novel Temporal Alignment Attention (TAA), designed to learn context-dependent alignment for peak demand forecasting. We conduct extensive empirical analysis on two large-scale proprietary datasets from a large e-commerce retailer. We demonstrate that TAT brings up to 30% accuracy improvement on peak demand forecasting while maintaining competitive overall performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Handwritten character recognition is getting popular among researchers because of its possible applications in facilitating technological search engines, social media, recommender systems, etc. The Devanagari script is one of the oldest language scripts in India that does not have proper digitization tools. With the advancement of computing and technology, the task of this research is to extract handwritten Hindi characters from an image of Devanagari script with an automated approach to save time and obsolete data. In this paper, we present a technique to recognize handwritten Devanagari characters using two deep convolutional neural network layers. This work employs a methodology that is useful to enhance the recognition rate and configures a convolutional neural network for effective Devanagari handwritten text recognition (DHTR). This approach uses the Devanagari handwritten character dataset (DHCD), an open dataset with 36 classes of Devanagari characters. Each of these classes has 1700 images for training and testing purposes. This approach obtains promising results in terms of accuracy by achieving 96.36% accuracy in testing and 99.55% in training time.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of balancing energy efficiency with performance in AI/ML models, focusing on DeepRX, a deep learning receiver based on a fully convolutional ResNet architecture. We evaluate the energy consumption of DeepRX, considering factors including FLOPs/Watt and FLOPs/clock, and find consistency between estimated and actual energy usage, influenced by memory access patterns. The research extends to comparing energy dynamics during training and inference phases. A key contribution is the application of knowledge distillation (KD) to train a compact DeepRX \textit{student} model that emulates the performance of the \textit{teacher} model but with reduced energy consumption. We experiment with different student model sizes, optimal teacher sizes, and KD hyperparameters. Performance is measured by comparing the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance versus Signal-to-Interference \& Noise Ratio (SINR) values of the distilled model and a model trained from scratch. The distilled models demonstrate a lower error floor across SINR levels, highlighting the effectiveness of KD in achieving energy-efficient AI solutions.

Abstract: We propose LoRA-MCL, a training scheme that extends next-token prediction in language models with a method designed to decode diverse, plausible sentence continuations at inference time. Traditional language modeling is an intrinsically ill-posed problem: given a context, multiple futures may be equally plausible. Our approach leverages Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) and the Winner-Takes-All (WTA) loss to efficiently handle ambiguity through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We provide a theoretical interpretation of applying Multiple Choice Learning to Language Modeling, assuming the data is generated from a mixture of distributions. To illustrate the proposed approach, we use data sampled from mixtures of Markov chains. We then demonstrate with extensive experiments on real-world visual and audio captioning tasks that our method achieves high diversity and relevance in generated outputs.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a promising distributed machine learning approach that enables collaborative training of a global model using multiple edge devices. The data distributed among the edge devices is highly heterogeneous. Thus, FL faces the challenge of data distribution and heterogeneity, where non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data across edge devices may yield in significant accuracy drop. Furthermore, the limited computation and communication capabilities of edge devices increase the likelihood of stragglers, thus leading to slow model convergence. In this paper, we propose the FedDHAD FL framework, which comes with two novel methods: Dynamic Heterogeneous model aggregation (FedDH) and Adaptive Dropout (FedAD). FedDH dynamically adjusts the weights of each local model within the model aggregation process based on the non-IID degree of heterogeneous data to deal with the statistical data heterogeneity. FedAD performs neuron-adaptive operations in response to heterogeneous devices to improve accuracy while achieving superb efficiency. The combination of these two methods makes FedDHAD significantly outperform state-of-the-art solutions in terms of accuracy (up to 6.7% higher), efficiency (up to 2.02 times faster), and computation cost (up to 15.0% smaller).

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that large language models (LLMs) possess the capability to solve graph reasoning tasks. Notably, even when graph structures are embedded within textual descriptions, LLMs can still effectively answer related questions. This raises a fundamental question: How can a decoder-only Transformer architecture understand underlying graph structures? To address this, we start with the substructure extraction task, interpreting the inner mechanisms inside the transformers and analyzing the impact of the input queries. Specifically, through both empirical results and theoretical analysis, we present Induced Substructure Filtration (ISF), a perspective that captures the substructure identification in the multi-layer transformers. We further validate the ISF process in LLMs, revealing consistent internal dynamics across layers. Building on these insights, we explore the broader capabilities of Transformers in handling diverse graph types. Specifically, we introduce the concept of thinking in substructures to efficiently extract complex composite patterns, and demonstrate that decoder-only Transformers can successfully extract substructures from attributed graphs, such as molecular graphs. Together, our findings offer a new insight on how sequence-based Transformers perform the substructure extraction task over graph data.

Abstract: Vision-language Models (VLMs) have emerged as general-purpose tools for addressing a variety of complex computer vision problems. Such models have been shown to be highly capable, but, at the same time, lacking some basic visual understanding skills. In this paper, we set out to understand the limitations of SoTA VLMs on fundamental visual tasks by constructing a series of tests that probe which components of design, specifically, may be lacking. Importantly, we go significantly beyond the current benchmarks, which simply measure the final performance of VLM response, by also comparing and contrasting it to the performance of probes trained directly on features obtained from the visual encoder, intermediate vision-language projection and LLM-decoder output. In doing so, we uncover shortcomings in VLMs and make a number of important observations about their capabilities, robustness and how they process visual information. We hope our insights will guide progress in further improving VLMs.

Abstract: In this work we examine LLMs' ability to ask clarification questions in task-oriented dialogues that follow the asynchronous instruction-giver/instruction-follower format. We present a new corpus that combines two existing annotations of the Minecraft Dialogue Corpus -- one for reference and ambiguity in reference, and one for SDRT including clarifications -- into a single common format providing the necessary information to experiment with clarifications and their relation to ambiguity. With this corpus we compare LLM actions with original human-generated clarification questions, examining how both humans and LLMs act in the case of ambiguity. We find that there is only a weak link between ambiguity and humans producing clarification questions in these dialogues, and low correlation between humans and LLMs. Humans hardly ever produce clarification questions for referential ambiguity, but often do so for task-based uncertainty. Conversely, LLMs produce more clarification questions for referential ambiguity, but less so for task uncertainty. We question if LLMs' ability to ask clarification questions is predicated on their recent ability to simulate reasoning, and test this with different reasoning approaches, finding that reasoning does appear to increase question frequency and relevancy.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative audio models, distinguishing between human-composed and generated music is becoming increasingly challenging. As a response, models for detecting fake music have been proposed. In this work, we explore the robustness of such systems under audio augmentations. To evaluate model generalization, we constructed a dataset consisting of both real and synthetic music generated using several systems. We then apply a range of audio transformations and analyze how they affect classification accuracy. We test the performance of a recent state-of-the-art musical deepfake detection model in the presence of audio augmentations. The performance of the model decreases significantly even with the introduction of light augmentations.

Abstract: Coral reefs are vital yet vulnerable ecosystems that require continuous monitoring to support conservation. While coral reef images provide essential information in coral monitoring, interpreting such images remains challenging due to the need for domain expertise. Visual Question Answering (VQA), powered by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), has great potential in user-friendly interaction with coral reef images. However, applying VQA to coral imagery demands a dedicated dataset that addresses two key challenges: domain-specific annotations and multidimensional questions. In this work, we introduce CoralVQA, the first large-scale VQA dataset for coral reef analysis. It contains 12,805 real-world coral images from 67 coral genera collected from 3 oceans, along with 277,653 question-answer pairs that comprehensively assess ecological and health-related conditions. To construct this dataset, we develop a semi-automatic data construction pipeline in collaboration with marine biologists to ensure both scalability and professional-grade data quality. CoralVQA presents novel challenges and provides a comprehensive benchmark for studying vision-language reasoning in the context of coral reef images. By evaluating several state-of-the-art LVLMs, we reveal key limitations and opportunities. These insights form a foundation for future LVLM development, with a particular emphasis on supporting coral conservation efforts.

Abstract: Pansharpening refers to the process of integrating a high resolution panchromatic (PAN) image with a lower resolution multispectral (MS) image to generate a fused product, which is pivotal in remote sensing. Despite the effectiveness of CNNs in addressing this challenge, they are inherently constrained by the uniform application of convolutional kernels across all spatial positions, overlooking local content variations. To overcome this issue, we introduce RAPNet, a new architecture that leverages content-adaptive convolution. At its core, RAPNet employs the Receptive-field Adaptive Pansharpening Convolution (RAPConv), designed to produce spatially adaptive kernels responsive to local feature context, thereby enhancing the precision of spatial detail extraction. Additionally, the network integrates the Pansharpening Dynamic Feature Fusion (PAN-DFF) module, which incorporates an attention mechanism to achieve an optimal balance between spatial detail enhancement and spectral fidelity. Comprehensive evaluations on publicly available datasets confirm that RAPNet delivers superior performance compared to existing approaches, as demonstrated by both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments. Ablation analyses further substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive components.

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) trained on audio spectrogram patches have emerged as a prominent approach for learning self-supervised audio representations. While several recent papers have evaluated key aspects of training MAEs on audio data, the majority of these approaches still leverage vanilla transformer building blocks, whereas the transformer community has seen steady integration of newer architectural advancements. In this work, we propose AudioMAE++, a revamped audio masked autoencoder with two such enhancements, namely macaron-style transformer blocks with gated linear units. When pretrained on the AudioSet dataset, the proposed AudioMAE++ models outperform existing MAE based approaches on 10 diverse downstream tasks, demonstrating excellent performance on audio classification and speech-based benchmarks. The proposed AudioMAE++ models also demonstrate excellent scaling characteristics, outperforming directly comparable standard MAE baselines with up to 4x more parameters.

Abstract: Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have significantly enhanced the realism and interactivity of non-player characters (NPCs) in virtual reality (VR), creating more engaging and believable user experiences. This paper evaluates AI-driven NPCs within a VR interrogation simulator, focusing on their perceived realism, usability, and system performance. The simulator features two AI-powered NPCs, a suspect, and a partner, using GPT-4 Turbo to engage participants in a scenario to determine the suspect's guilt or innocence. A user study with 18 participants assessed the system using the System Usability Scale (SUS), Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQ), and a Virtual Agent Believability Questionnaire, alongside latency measurements for speech-to-text (STT), text-to-speech (TTS), OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo, and overall (cycle) latency. Results showed an average cycle latency of 7 seconds, influenced by the increasing conversational context. Believability scored 6.67 out of 10, with high ratings in behavior, social relationships, and intelligence but moderate scores in emotion and personality. The system achieved a SUS score of 79.44, indicating good usability. These findings demonstrate the potential of large language models to improve NPC realism and interaction in VR while highlighting challenges in reducing system latency and enhancing emotional depth. This research contributes to the development of more sophisticated AI-driven NPCs, revealing the need for performance optimization to achieve increasingly immersive virtual experiences.

Abstract: The aging population is growing rapidly, and so is the danger of falls in older adults. A major cause of injury is falling, and detection in time can greatly save medical expenses and recovery time. However, to provide timely intervention and avoid unnecessary alarms, detection systems must be effective and reliable while addressing privacy concerns regarding the user. In this work, we propose a framework for detecting falls using several complementary systems: a semi-supervised federated learning-based fall detection system (SF2D), an indoor localization and navigation system, and a vision-based human fall recognition system. A wearable device and an edge device identify a fall scenario in the first system. On top of that, the second system uses an indoor localization technique first to localize the fall location and then navigate a robot to inspect the scenario. A vision-based detection system running on an edge device with a mounted camera on a robot is used to recognize fallen people. Each of the systems of this proposed framework achieves different accuracy rates. Specifically, the SF2D has a 0.81% failure rate equivalent to 99.19% accuracy, while the vision-based fallen people detection achieves 96.3% accuracy. However, when we combine the accuracy of these two systems with the accuracy of the navigation system (95% success rate), our proposed framework creates a highly reliable performance for fall detection, with an overall accuracy of 99.99%. Not only is the proposed framework safe for older adults, but it is also a privacy-preserving solution for detecting falls.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about reliably detecting AI-generated text. Stylometric metrics work well on autoregressive (AR) outputs, but their effectiveness on diffusion-based models is unknown. We present the first systematic comparison of diffusion-generated text (LLaDA) and AR-generated text (LLaMA) using 2 000 samples. Perplexity, burstiness, lexical diversity, readability, and BLEU/ROUGE scores show that LLaDA closely mimics human text in perplexity and burstiness, yielding high false-negative rates for AR-oriented detectors. LLaMA shows much lower perplexity but reduced lexical fidelity. Relying on any single metric fails to separate diffusion outputs from human writing. We highlight the need for diffusion-aware detectors and outline directions such as hybrid models, diffusion-specific stylometric signatures, and robust watermarking.

Abstract: Retinal anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in screening ocular and systemic diseases. Despite its significance, progress in the field has been hindered by the absence of a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark, which is essential for the fair evaluation and advancement of methodologies. Due to this limitation, previous anomaly detection work related to retinal images has been constrained by (1) a limited and overly simplistic set of anomaly types, (2) test sets that are nearly saturated, and (3) a lack of generalization evaluation, resulting in less convincing experimental setups. Furthermore, existing benchmarks in medical anomaly detection predominantly focus on one-class supervised approaches (training only with negative samples), overlooking the vast amounts of labeled abnormal data and unlabeled data that are commonly available in clinical practice. To bridge these gaps, we introduce a benchmark for retinal anomaly detection, which is comprehensive and systematic in terms of data and algorithm. Through categorizing and benchmarking previous methods, we find that a fully supervised approach leveraging disentangled representations of abnormalities (DRA) achieves the best performance but suffers from significant drops in performance when encountering certain unseen anomalies. Inspired by the memory bank mechanisms in one-class supervised learning, we propose NFM-DRA, which integrates DRA with a Normal Feature Memory to mitigate the performance degradation, establishing a new SOTA. The benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/DopamineLcy/BenchReAD.

Abstract: Transformers are increasingly prevalent for multi-view computer vision tasks, where geometric relationships between viewpoints are critical for 3D perception. To leverage these relationships, multi-view transformers must use camera geometry to ground visual tokens in 3D space. In this work, we compare techniques for conditioning transformers on cameras: token-level raymap encodings, attention-level relative pose encodings, and a new relative encoding we propose -- Projective Positional Encoding (PRoPE) -- that captures complete camera frustums, both intrinsics and extrinsics, as a relative positional encoding. Our experiments begin by showing how relative camera conditioning improves performance in feedforward novel view synthesis, with further gains from PRoPE. This holds across settings: scenes with both shared and varying intrinsics, when combining token- and attention-level conditioning, and for generalization to inputs with out-of-distribution sequence lengths and camera intrinsics. We then verify that these benefits persist for different tasks, stereo depth estimation and discriminative spatial cognition, as well as larger model sizes.

Abstract: While autonomous driving technologies continue to advance, current Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) remain limited in their ability to interpret scene context or engage with drivers through natural language. These systems typically rely on predefined logic and lack support for dialogue-based interaction, making them inflexible in dynamic environments or when adapting to driver intent. This paper presents Scene-Aware Conversational ADAS (SC-ADAS), a modular framework that integrates Generative AI components including large language models, vision-to-text interpretation, and structured function calling to enable real-time, interpretable, and adaptive driver assistance. SC-ADAS supports multi-turn dialogue grounded in visual and sensor context, allowing natural language recommendations and driver-confirmed ADAS control. Implemented in the CARLA simulator with cloud-based Generative AI, the system executes confirmed user intents as structured ADAS commands without requiring model fine-tuning. We evaluate SC-ADAS across scene-aware, conversational, and revisited multi-turn interactions, highlighting trade-offs such as increased latency from vision-based context retrieval and token growth from accumulated dialogue history. These results demonstrate the feasibility of combining conversational reasoning, scene perception, and modular ADAS control to support the next generation of intelligent driver assistance.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence holds immense promise for transforming biology, yet a lack of standardized, cross domain, benchmarks undermines our ability to build robust, trustworthy models. Here, we present insights from a recent workshop that convened machine learning and computational biology experts across imaging, transcriptomics, proteomics, and genomics to tackle this gap. We identify major technical and systemic bottlenecks such as data heterogeneity and noise, reproducibility challenges, biases, and the fragmented ecosystem of publicly available resources and propose a set of recommendations for building benchmarking frameworks that can efficiently compare ML models of biological systems across tasks and data modalities. By promoting high quality data curation, standardized tooling, comprehensive evaluation metrics, and open, collaborative platforms, we aim to accelerate the development of robust benchmarks for AI driven Virtual Cells. These benchmarks are crucial for ensuring rigor, reproducibility, and biological relevance, and will ultimately advance the field toward integrated models that drive new discoveries, therapeutic insights, and a deeper understanding of cellular systems.

<title>Chat with AI: The Surprising Turn of Real-time Video Communication from Human to AI</title>

Abstract: AI Video Chat emerges as a new paradigm for Real-time Communication (RTC), where one peer is not a human, but a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). This makes interaction between humans and AI more intuitive, as if chatting face-to-face with a real person. However, this poses significant challenges to latency, because the MLLM inference takes up most of the response time, leaving very little time for video streaming. Due to network uncertainty and instability, transmission latency becomes a critical bottleneck preventing AI from being like a real person. To address this, we propose Artic, an AI-oriented Real-time Communication framework, exploring the network requirement shift from "humans watching video" to "AI understanding video". To reduce bitrate dramatically while maintaining MLLM accuracy, we propose Context-Aware Video Streaming that recognizes the importance of each video region for chat and allocates bitrate almost exclusively to chat-important regions. To avoid packet retransmission, we propose Loss-Resilient Adaptive Frame Rate that leverages previous frames to substitute for lost/delayed frames while avoiding bitrate waste. To evaluate the impact of video streaming quality on MLLM accuracy, we build the first benchmark, named Degraded Video Understanding Benchmark (DeViBench). Finally, we discuss some open questions and ongoing solutions for AI Video Chat.

Abstract: Transition state (TS) structures define the critical geometries and energy barriers underlying chemical reactivity, yet their fleeting nature renders them experimentally elusive and drives the reliance on costly, high-throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Here, we introduce TS-GEN, a conditional flow-matching generative model that maps samples from a simple Gaussian prior directly to transition-state saddle-point geometries in a single, deterministic pass. By embedding both reactant and product conformations as conditioning information, TS-GEN learns to transport latent noise to true TS structures via an optimal-transport path, effectively replacing the iterative optimization common in nudged-elastic band or string-method algorithms. TS-GEN delivers unprecedented accuracy, achieving a root-mean-square deviation of $0.004\ \rm{\mathring{A}}$ (vs. $0.103\ \rm{\mathring{A}}$ for prior state-of-the-art) and a mean barrier-height error of $1.019\ {\rm kcal/mol}$ (vs. $2.864\ {\rm kcal/mol}$), while requiring only $0.06\ {\rm s}$ GPU time per inference. Over 87% of generated TSs meet chemical-accuracy criteria ($<1.58\ {\rm kcal/mol}$ error), substantially outpacing existing methods. TS-GEN also exhibits strong transferability to out-of-distribution reactions from a larger database. By uniting sub-angstrom precision, sub-second speed, and broad applicability, TS-GEN will be highly useful for high-throughput exploration of complex reaction networks, paving the way to the exploration of novel chemical reaction mechanisms.

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been a longstanding focus of research. Recent works have further enhanced these capabilities using reinforcement learning (RL), with many new methods claiming significant improvements with minimal or no external supervision. Surprisingly, some studies even suggest that random or incorrect reward signals can enhance reasoning performance. However, these breakthroughs are mostly reported on the Qwen2.5 model family and evaluated on well-known benchmarks such as MATH-500, AMC, and AIME, while failing to achieve similar gains on other models like Llama, which warrants further investigation. Our analysis shows that although Qwen2.5 achieves strong mathematical reasoning performance, its pretraining on large-scale web corpora makes it vulnerable to data contamination in popular benchmarks. As a result, results derived from these benchmarks may be unreliable. To address this, we introduce a generator that produces fully synthetic arithmetic problems of arbitrary length and difficulty, yielding a clean dataset we call RandomCalculation. Using these leakage-free datasets, we show that only accurate reward signals consistently improve performance, while noisy or incorrect signals do not. We advocate for evaluating RL methods on uncontaminated benchmarks and across diverse model families to ensure trustworthy conclusions.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in end-to-end AI music generation, AI-driven modeling of professional Digital Signal Processing (DSP) workflows remains challenging. In particular, while there is growing interest in neural black-box modeling of audio effect graphs (e.g. reverb, compression, equalization), AI-based approaches struggle to replicate the nuanced signal flow and parameter interactions used in professional workflows. Existing differentiable plugin approaches often diverge from real-world tools, exhibiting inferior performance relative to simplified neural controllers under equivalent computational constraints. We introduce WildFX, a pipeline containerized with Docker for generating multi-track audio mixing datasets with rich effect graphs, powered by a professional Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) backend. WildFX supports seamless integration of cross-platform commercial plugins or any plugins in the wild, in VST/VST3/LV2/CLAP formats, enabling structural complexity (e.g., sidechains, crossovers) and achieving efficient parallelized processing. A minimalist metadata interface simplifies project/plugin configuration. Experiments demonstrate the pipeline's validity through blind estimation of mixing graphs, plugin/gain parameters, and its ability to bridge AI research with practical DSP demands. The code is available on: https://github.com/IsaacYQH/WildFX.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the state-of-the-art in various coding tasks. Beyond directly answering user queries, LLMs can also serve as judges, assessing and comparing the quality of responses generated by other models. Such an evaluation capability is crucial both for benchmarking different LLMs and for improving response quality through response ranking. However, despite the growing adoption of the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, its effectiveness in coding scenarios remains underexplored due to the absence of dedicated benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce CodeJudgeBench, a benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge models across three critical coding tasks: code generation, code repair, and unit test generation. Through comprehensive benchmarking of 26 LLM-as-a-Judge models, we find that recent thinking models significantly outperform non-thinking models on our carefully designed code judging tasks. Notably, even relatively small thinking models, such as Qwen3-8B, can outperform specially trained LLM-as-a-Judge models up to 70B in size. Nevertheless, all models still exhibit significant randomness in their judgment of coding tasks. For pairwise judging tasks, simply changing the order in which responses are presented can substantially impact accuracy. In addition, when judging code and unit tests written by different LLMs, LLM-as-a-Judge models also show variance in performance. This sensitivity raises concerns about the reliability and consistency of LLM-as-a-Judge in coding scenarios. Lastly, we study optimal prompting strategies for LLM-as-a-Judge. We find that using pair-wise comparison outperforms scalar point-wise judging. Furthermore, retaining comments and reasoning in the full, unprocessed LLM response leads to improved judge performance.

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity real-time animated sequences of photorealistic 3D head avatars is important for many graphics applications, including immersive telepresence and movies. This is a challenging problem particularly when rendering digital avatar close-ups for showing character's facial microfeatures and expressions. To capture the expressive, detailed nature of human heads, including skin furrowing and finer-scale facial movements, we propose to couple locally-defined facial expressions with 3D Gaussian splatting to enable creating ultra-high fidelity, expressive and photorealistic 3D head avatars. In contrast to previous works that operate on a global expression space, we condition our avatar's dynamics on patch-based local expression features and synthesize 3D Gaussians at a patch level. In particular, we leverage a patch-based geometric 3D face model to extract patch expressions and learn how to translate these into local dynamic skin appearance and motion by coupling the patches with anchor points of Scaffold-GS, a recent hierarchical scene representation. These anchors are then used to synthesize 3D Gaussians on-the-fly, conditioned by patch-expressions and viewing direction. We employ color-based densification and progressive training to obtain high-quality results and faster convergence for high resolution 3K training images. By leveraging patch-level expressions, ScaffoldAvatar consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance with visually natural motion, while encompassing diverse facial expressions and styles in real time.

Abstract: Neural Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) based models are powerful and interpretable approaches to neuro-symbolic learning and have shown promising results in classification and reinforcement learning settings without prior knowledge of the tasks. However, their performance is degraded by the thresholding of the post-training symbolic translation process. We show here that part of the performance degradation during translation is due to its failure to disentangle the learned knowledge represented in the form of the networks' weights. We address this issue by proposing a new disentanglement method; by splitting nodes that encode nested rules into smaller independent nodes, we are able to better preserve the models' performance. Through experiments on binary, multiclass, and multilabel classification tasks (including those requiring predicate invention), we demonstrate that our disentanglement method provides compact and interpretable logical representations for the neural DNF-based models, with performance closer to that of their pre-translation counterparts. Our code is available at https://github.com/kittykg/disentangling-ndnf-classification.

Abstract: Recent advanced vision-language models(VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on passive, offline image and video understanding tasks. However, their effectiveness in embodied settings, which require online interaction and active scene understanding remains limited. In such scenarios, an agent perceives the environment from a first-person perspective, with each action dynamically shaping subsequent observations. Even state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro struggle in open-environment interactions, exhibiting clear limitations in spatial reasoning and long-horizon planning. To address this gap, we introduce EmRACE-3K, a dataset of over 3,000 language-guided tasks situated in diverse, photorealistic environments constructed using Unreal Engine and the UnrealCV-Zoo framework. The tasks encompass a wide range of embodied challenges, including navigation, object manipulation, and multi-stage goal execution. Each task unfolds as a multi-step trajectory, pairing first-person visual observations with high-level instructions, grounded actions, and natural language rationales that express the agent's intent at every step. Using EmRACE-3K, we establish a benchmark to evaluate the embodied reasoning capabilities of VLMs across three key dimensions: Exploration, Dynamic Spatial-Semantic Reasoning, and Multi-stage Goal Execution. In zero-shot settings, all models achieve success rates below 20%, underscoring the challenge posed by our benchmark and the current limitations of VLMs in interactive environments. To demonstrate the utility of EmRACE-3K, we further fine-tune Qwen2.5-VL-7B using supervised learning followed by reinforcement learning. This approach yields substantial improvements across all three challenge categories, highlighting the dataset's effectiveness in enabling the development of embodied reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Camera traps are revolutionising wildlife monitoring by capturing vast amounts of visual data; however, the manual identification of individual animals remains a significant bottleneck. This study introduces a fully self-supervised approach to learning robust chimpanzee face embeddings from unlabeled camera-trap footage. Leveraging the DINOv2 framework, we train Vision Transformers on automatically mined face crops, eliminating the need for identity labels. Our method demonstrates strong open-set re-identification performance, surpassing supervised baselines on challenging benchmarks such as Bossou, despite utilising no labelled data during training. This work underscores the potential of self-supervised learning in biodiversity monitoring and paves the way for scalable, non-invasive population studies.

Abstract: We study infinite horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs) with "fast-slow" structure, where some state variables evolve rapidly ("fast states") while others change more gradually ("slow states"). This structure commonly arises in practice when decisions must be made at high frequencies over long horizons, and where slowly changing information still plays a critical role in determining optimal actions. Examples include inventory control under slowly changing demand indicators or dynamic pricing with gradually shifting consumer behavior. Modeling the problem at the natural decision frequency leads to MDPs with discount factors close to one, making them computationally challenging. We propose a novel approximation strategy that "freezes" slow states during phases of lower-level planning and subsequently applies value iteration to an auxiliary upper-level MDP that evolves on a slower timescale. Freezing states for short periods of time leads to easier-to-solve lower-level problems, while a slower upper-level timescale allows for a more favorable discount factor. On the theoretical side, we analyze the regret incurred by our frozen-state approach, which leads to simple insights on how to trade off regret versus computational cost. Empirically, we benchmark our new frozen-state methods on three domains, (i) inventory control with fixed order costs, (ii) a gridworld problem with spatial tasks, and (iii) dynamic pricing with reference-price effects. We demonstrate that the new methods produce high-quality policies with significantly less computation, and we show that simply omitting slow states is often a poor heuristic.

Abstract: Gradient Inversion Attacks invert the transmitted gradients in Federated Learning (FL) systems to reconstruct the sensitive data of local clients and have raised considerable privacy concerns. A majority of gradient inversion methods rely heavily on explicit prior knowledge (e.g., a well pre-trained generative model), which is often unavailable in realistic scenarios. This is because real-world client data distributions are often highly heterogeneous, domain-specific, and unavailable to attackers, making it impractical for attackers to obtain perfectly matched pre-trained models, which inevitably suffer from fundamental distribution shifts relative to target private data. To alleviate this issue, researchers have proposed to leverage the implicit prior knowledge of an over-parameterized network. However, they only utilize a fixed neural architecture for all the attack settings. This would hinder the adaptive use of implicit architectural priors and consequently limit the generalizability. In this paper, we further exploit such implicit prior knowledge by proposing Gradient Inversion via Neural Architecture Search (GI-NAS), which adaptively searches the network and captures the implicit priors behind neural architectures. Extensive experiments verify that our proposed GI-NAS can achieve superior attack performance compared to state-of-the-art gradient inversion methods, even under more practical settings with high-resolution images, large-sized batches, and advanced defense strategies. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to successfully introduce NAS to the gradient inversion community. We believe that this work exposes critical vulnerabilities in real-world federated learning by demonstrating high-fidelity reconstruction of sensitive data without requiring domain-specific priors, forcing urgent reassessment of FL privacy safeguards.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), aligning policy models with human preferences has become increasingly critical. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a promising approach for alignment, acting as an RL-free alternative to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Despite DPO's various advancements and inherent limitations, an in-depth review of these aspects is currently lacking in the literature. In this work, we present a comprehensive review of the challenges and opportunities in DPO, covering theoretical analyses, variants, relevant preference datasets, and applications. Specifically, we categorize recent studies on DPO based on key research questions to provide a thorough understanding of DPO's current landscape. Additionally, we propose several future research directions to offer insights on model alignment for the research community. An updated collection of relevant papers can be found on https://github.com/Mr-Loevan/DPO-Survey.

Abstract: Recently, newly developed Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as OpenAI's o1, have emerged, seemingly demonstrating advanced reasoning capabilities across text and image modalities. However, the depth of these advances in language-guided perception and abstract reasoning remains underexplored, and it is unclear whether these models can truly live up to their ambitious promises. To assess the progress and identify shortcomings, we enter the wonderland of Bongard problems, a set of classic visual reasoning puzzles that require human-like abilities of pattern recognition and abstract reasoning. With our extensive evaluation setup, we show that while VLMs occasionally succeed in identifying discriminative concepts and solving some of the problems, they frequently falter. Surprisingly, even elementary concepts that may seem trivial to humans, such as simple spirals, pose significant challenges. Moreover, when explicitly asked to recognize ground truth concepts, they continue to falter, suggesting not only a lack of understanding of these elementary visual concepts but also an inability to generalize to unseen concepts. We compare the results of VLMs to human performance and observe that a significant gap remains between human visual reasoning capabilities and machine cognition.

Abstract: Utilizing large language models (LLMs) for tool planning has emerged as a promising avenue for developing general AI systems, where LLMs automatically schedule external tools (e.g., vision models) to tackle complex tasks based on task descriptions. To push this paradigm toward practical applications, it is crucial for LLMs to consider tool execution costs (e.g., execution time) for tool planning. Unfortunately, prior studies overlook the tool execution costs, leading to the generation of expensive plans whose costs outweigh their benefits in terms of task performance. To fill this gap, we propose the Cost-Aware Tool Planning with LLMs (CATP-LLM) framework, which for the first time provides a coherent design to empower LLMs for cost-aware tool planning. Specifically, To facilitate efficient concurrent tool execution and cost reduction, we design a tool planning language to enhance the LLM for creating multi-branch non-sequential plans. Moreover, we propose a cost-aware offline reinforcement learning algorithm to fine-tune the LLM to optimize the performance-cost trade-off in tool planning. In the lack of public cost-related datasets, we further present OpenCATP, the first dataset for cost-aware planning, which comprises 11,100 evaluation samples from diverse tasks. Extensive experiments show that CATP-LLM outperforms GPT-4 even when using Llama2-7B as its backbone, with the average improvement of 1.5%-93.9% in terms of plan quality. Codes and dataset are available at: https://github.com/duowuyms/OpenCATP-LLM.

Abstract: Extending the context length of Language Models (LMs) by improving Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) has become a trend. While prior works mainly address RoPE's limitations within attention, this paper uncovers the adverse effects on length generalization from nearly all parts of LMs. Using Discrete Signal Processing theory, we show that RoPE enables periodic attention by implicitly achieving Non-Uniform Discrete Fourier Transform. However, this periodicity is undermined by the spectrum damage caused by: 1) linear layers and activation functions; 2) insufficiently trained frequency components brought by time-domain truncation. Building on our observations, we propose Fourier Position Embedding (FoPE), which enhances attention's frequency-domain properties to improve both its periodic extension and length generalization. FoPE constructs \textit{Fourier Series} and zero-outs the destructive frequency components, increasing model robustness against the spectrum damage. Experiments across various model scales and benchmarks show that, within varying context windows, FoPE maintains a more stable performance compared to other baselines. Several analyses and ablations bring further support to our method and theoretical modeling.

Abstract: Robustness of reasoning remains a significant challenge for large language models, and addressing it is essential for the practical applicability of AI-driven reasoning systems. We introduce Semantic Self-Verification (SSV), a novel approach that addresses the key challenge in combining language models with the rigor of logical solvers: to accurately formulate the reasoning problem from natural language to the formal language of the solver. SSV uses a consistency-based approach to produce strong abstract formalizations of problems using concrete instantiations that are generated by the model and verified by the solver. In addition to significantly advancing the overall reasoning accuracy over the state-of-the-art, a key novelty that this approach presents is a feature of verification that has near-perfect precision over a significant coverage of cases, as we demonstrate on open reasoning benchmarks. We propose such *near-certain reasoning* as a new approach to reduce the need for manual verification in many cases, taking us closer to more dependable and autonomous AI reasoning systems.

Abstract: Policymakers increasingly use development cost and compute as proxies for AI capabilities and risks. Recent laws have introduced regulatory requirements that are contingent on specific thresholds. However, technical ambiguities in how to perform this accounting create loopholes that can undermine regulatory effectiveness. We propose seven principles for designing AI cost and compute accounting standards that (1) reduce opportunities for strategic gaming, (2) avoid disincentivizing responsible risk mitigation, and (3) enable consistent implementation across companies and jurisdictions.

Abstract: Leveraging multiple large language models (LLMs) to build collaborative multi-agentic workflows has demonstrated significant potential. However, most previous studies focus on prompting the out-of-the-box LLMs, relying on their innate capability for collaboration, which may not improve LLMs' performance as shown recently. In this paper, we introduce a new post-training paradigm MAPoRL (Multi-Agent Post-co-training for collaborative LLMs with Reinforcement Learning), to explicitly elicit the collaborative behaviors and further unleash the power of multi-agentic LLM frameworks. In MAPoRL, multiple LLMs first generate their own responses independently and engage in a multi-turn discussion to collaboratively improve the final answer. In the end, a MAPoRL verifier evaluates both the answer and the discussion, by assigning a score that verifies the correctness of the answer, while adding incentives to encourage corrective and persuasive discussions. The score serves as the co-training reward, and is then maximized through multi-agent RL. Unlike existing LLM post-training paradigms, MAPoRL advocates the co-training of multiple LLMs together using RL for better generalization. Accompanied by analytical insights, our experiments demonstrate that training individual LLMs alone is insufficient to induce effective collaboration. In contrast, multi-agent co-training can boost the collaboration performance across benchmarks, with generalization to unseen domains.

Abstract: Modern reinforcement learning (RL) systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex environments, such as video games. However, they still fall short of achieving human-like sample efficiency and adaptability when learning new domains. Theory-based reinforcement learning (TBRL) is an algorithmic framework specifically designed to address this gap. Modeled on cognitive theories, TBRL leverages structured, causal world models - "theories" - as forward simulators for use in planning, generalization and exploration. Although current TBRL systems provide compelling explanations of how humans learn to play video games, they face several technical limitations: their theory languages are restrictive, and their planning algorithms are not scalable. To address these challenges, we introduce TheoryCoder, an instantiation of TBRL that exploits hierarchical representations of theories and efficient program synthesis methods for more powerful learning and planning. TheoryCoder equips agents with general-purpose abstractions (e.g., "move to"), which are then grounded in a particular environment by learning a low-level transition model (a Python program synthesized from observations by a large language model). A bilevel planning algorithm can exploit this hierarchical structure to solve large domains. We demonstrate that this approach can be successfully applied to diverse and challenging grid-world games, where approaches based on directly synthesizing a policy perform poorly. Ablation studies demonstrate the benefits of using hierarchical abstractions.

Abstract: Recent advances in automated theorem proving (ATP) through LLMs have highlighted the potential of formal reasoning with Lean 4 codes. However, ATP has not yet be revolutionized by the recent posttraining scaling as demonstrated by Open AI O1/O3 and Deepseek R1. In this work, we investigate the entire posttraining of ATP, aiming to align it with breakthroughs in reasoning models in natural languages. To begin, we continual train current ATP models with a hybrid dataset, which consists of numerous statement-proof pairs, and additional data aimed at incorporating cognitive behaviors that emulate human reasoning and hypothesis refinement. Next, we explore reinforcement learning with the use of outcome reward returned by Lean 4 compiler. Through our designed continual training and reinforcement learning processes, we have successfully improved existing formal provers, including both DeepSeek-Prover-v1.5 and Goedel-Prover, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the field of whole-proof generation. For example, we achieve a 59.8% pass rate (pass@32) on MiniF2F. This is an on-going project and we will progressively update our findings, release our data and training details.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning language models have witnessed a paradigm shift from short to long CoT pattern. Given the substantial computational cost of rollouts in long CoT models, maximizing the utility of fixed training datasets becomes crucial. Our analysis reveals that negative responses contain valuable components such as self-reflection and error-correction steps, yet primary existing methods either completely discard negative samples (RFT) or apply equal penalization across all tokens (RL), failing to leverage these potential learning signals. In light of this, we propose Behavior Constrained Policy Gradient with Negative Sample Augmentation (BCPG-NSA), a fine-grained offline RL framework that encompasses three stages: 1) sample segmentation, 2) consensus-based step correctness assessment combining LLM and PRM judgers, and 3) policy optimization with NSA designed to effectively mine positive steps within negative samples. Experimental results show that BCPG-NSA outperforms baselines on several challenging math/coding reasoning benchmarks using the same training dataset, achieving improved sample efficiency and demonstrating robustness and scalability when extended to multiple iterations.

Abstract: Embodied planning requires agents to make coherent multi-step decisions based on dynamic visual observations and natural language goals. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) excel at static perception tasks, they struggle with the temporal reasoning, spatial understanding, and commonsense grounding needed for planning in interactive environments. In this work, we introduce a reinforcement fine-tuning framework that brings R1-style reasoning enhancement into embodied planning. We first distill a high-quality dataset from a powerful closed-source model and perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to equip the model with structured decision-making priors. We then design a rule-based reward function tailored to multi-step action quality and optimize the policy via Generalized Reinforced Preference Optimization (GRPO). Our approach is evaluated on Embench, a recent benchmark for interactive embodied tasks, covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms models of similar or larger scale, including GPT-4o-mini and 70B+ open-source baselines, and exhibits strong generalization to unseen environments. This work highlights the potential of reinforcement-driven reasoning to advance long-horizon planning in embodied AI.

Abstract: Scientific discoveries increasingly rely on complex multimodal reasoning based on information-intensive scientific data and domain-specific expertise. Empowered by expert-level scientific benchmarks, scientific Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold the potential to significantly enhance this discovery process in realistic workflows. However, current scientific benchmarks mostly focus on evaluating the knowledge understanding capabilities of MLLMs, leading to an inadequate assessment of their perception and reasoning abilities. To address this gap, we present the Scientists' First Exam (SFE) benchmark, designed to evaluate the scientific cognitive capacities of MLLMs through three interconnected levels: scientific signal perception, scientific attribute understanding, scientific comparative reasoning. Specifically, SFE comprises 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across three question types, spanning 66 multimodal tasks across five high-value disciplines. Extensive experiments reveal that current state-of-the-art GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 achieve only 34.08% and 26.52% on SFE, highlighting significant room for MLLMs to improve in scientific realms. We hope the insights obtained in SFE will facilitate further developments in AI-enhanced scientific discoveries.

Abstract: Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems use uniform processing, causing inefficiency as simple queries consume resources similar to complex multi-hop tasks. We present SymRAG, a framework that introduces adaptive query routing via real-time complexity and load assessment to select symbolic, neural, or hybrid pathways. SymRAG's neuro-symbolic approach adjusts computational pathways based on both query characteristics and system load, enabling efficient resource allocation across diverse query types. By combining linguistic and structural query properties with system load metrics, SymRAG allocates resources proportional to reasoning requirements. Evaluated on 2,000 queries across HotpotQA (multi-hop reasoning) and DROP (discrete reasoning) using Llama-3.2-3B and Mistral-7B models, SymRAG achieves competitive accuracy (97.6--100.0% exact match) with efficient resource utilization (3.6--6.2% CPU utilization, 0.985--3.165s processing). Disabling adaptive routing increases processing time by 169--1151%, showing its significance for complex models. These results suggest adaptive computation strategies are more sustainable and scalable for hybrid AI systems that use dynamic routing and neuro-symbolic frameworks.

Abstract: Individual causal inference (ICI) uses causal inference methods to understand and predict the effects of interventions on individuals, considering their specific characteristics / facts. It aims to estimate individual causal effect (ICE), which varies across individuals. Estimating ICE can be challenging due to the limited data available for individuals, and the fact that most causal inference methods are population-based. Structural Causal Model (SCM) is fundamentally population-based. Therefore, causal discovery (structural learning and parameter learning), association queries and intervention queries are all naturally population-based. However, exogenous variables (U) in SCM can encode individual variations and thus provide the mechanism for individualized population per specific individual characteristics / facts. Based on this, we propose ICI with SCM as a "rung 3" causal inference, because it involves "imagining" what would be the causal effect of a hypothetical intervention on an individual, given the individual's observed characteristics / facts. Specifically, we propose the indiv-operator, indiv(W), to formalize/represent the population individualization process, and the individual causal query, P(Y | indiv(W), do(X), Z), to formalize/represent ICI. We show and argue that ICI with SCM is inference on individual alternatives (possible), not individual counterfactuals (non-actual).

Abstract: Designing experiments and result interpretations are core scientific competencies, particularly in biology, where researchers perturb complex systems to uncover the underlying systems. Recent efforts to evaluate the scientific capabilities of large language models (LLMs) fail to test these competencies because wet-lab experimentation is prohibitively expensive: in expertise, time and equipment. We introduce SciGym, a first-in-class benchmark that assesses LLMs' iterative experiment design and analysis abilities in open-ended scientific discovery tasks. SciGym overcomes the challenge of wet-lab costs by running a dry lab of biological systems. These models, encoded in Systems Biology Markup Language, are efficient for generating simulated data, making them ideal testbeds for experimentation on realistically complex systems. We evaluated six frontier LLMs on 137 small systems, and released a total of 350 systems. Our evaluation shows that while more capable models demonstrated superior performance, all models' performance declined significantly as system complexity increased, suggesting substantial room for improvement in the scientific capabilities of LLM agents.

Abstract: Capsule networks are biologically inspired neural networks that group neurons into vectors called capsules, each explicitly representing an object or one of its parts. The routing mechanism connects capsules in consecutive layers, forming a hierarchical structure between parts and objects, also known as a parse tree. Capsule networks often attempt to model all elements in an image, requiring large network sizes to handle complexities such as intricate backgrounds or irrelevant objects. However, this comprehensive modeling leads to increased parameter counts and computational inefficiencies. Our goal is to enable capsule networks to focus only on the object of interest, reducing the number of parse trees. We accomplish this with REM (Routing Entropy Minimization), a technique that minimizes the entropy of the parse tree-like structure. REM drives the model parameters distribution towards low entropy configurations through a pruning mechanism, significantly reducing the generation of intra-class parse trees. This empowers capsules to learn more stable and succinct representations with fewer parameters and negligible performance loss.

Abstract: Recent research reveals that machine learning (ML) models are highly sensitive to minor changes in their training procedure, such as the inclusion or exclusion of a single data point, leading to conflicting predictions on individual data points; a property termed as arbitrariness or instability in ML pipelines in prior work. Drawing from the uncertainty literature, we show that stability decomposes into epistemic and aleatoric components, capturing the consistency and confidence in prediction, respectively. We use this decomposition to provide two main contributions. Our first contribution is an extensive empirical evaluation. We find that (i) epistemic instability can be reduced with more training data whereas aleatoric instability cannot; (ii) state-of-the-art ML models have aleatoric instability as high as 79% and aleatoric instability disparities among demographic groups as high as 29% in popular fairness benchmarks; and (iii) fairness pre-processing interventions generally increase aleatoric instability more than in-processing interventions, and both epistemic and aleatoric instability are highly sensitive to data-processing interventions and model architecture. Our second contribution is a practical solution to the problem of systematic arbitrariness. We propose a model selection procedure that includes epistemic and aleatoric criteria alongside existing accuracy and fairness criteria, and show that it successfully narrows down a large set of good models (50-100 on our datasets) to a handful of stable, fair and accurate ones. We built and publicly released a python library to measure epistemic and aleatoric multiplicity in any ML pipeline alongside existing confusion-matrix-based metrics, providing practitioners with a rich suite of evaluation metrics to use to define a more precise criterion during model selection.

<title>CoCo: A Coupled Contrastive Framework for Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Graph Classification</title>

Abstract: Although graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved impressive achievements in graph classification, they often need abundant task-specific labels, which could be extensively costly to acquire. A credible solution is to explore additional labeled graphs to enhance unsupervised learning on the target domain. However, how to apply GNNs to domain adaptation remains unsolved owing to the insufficient exploration of graph topology and the significant domain discrepancy. In this paper, we propose Coupled Contrastive Graph Representation Learning (CoCo), which extracts the topological information from coupled learning branches and reduces the domain discrepancy with coupled contrastive learning. CoCo contains a graph convolutional network branch and a hierarchical graph kernel network branch, which explore graph topology in implicit and explicit manners. Besides, we incorporate coupled branches into a holistic multi-view contrastive learning framework, which not only incorporates graph representations learned from complementary views for enhanced understanding, but also encourages the similarity between cross-domain example pairs with the same semantics for domain alignment. Extensive experiments on popular datasets show that our CoCo outperforms these competing baselines in different settings generally.

<title>Bounding the Worst-class Error: A Boosting Approach</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14890</link>

Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of the worst-class error rate, instead of the standard error rate averaged over all classes. For example, a three-class classification task with class-wise error rates of 10%, 10%, and 40% has a worst-class error rate of 40%, whereas the average is 20% under the class-balanced condition. The worst-class error is important in many applications. For example, in a medical image classification task, it would not be acceptable for the malignant tumor class to have a 40% error rate, while the benign and healthy classes have a 10% error rates. To avoid overfitting in worst-class error minimization using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), we design a problem formulation for bounding the worst-class error instead of achieving zero worst-class error. Moreover, to correctly bound the worst-class error, we propose a boosting approach which ensembles DNNs. We give training and generalization worst-class-error bound. Experimental results show that the algorithm lowers worst-class test error rates while avoiding overfitting to the training set.

Abstract: The integration of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is gradually attracting attention due to the low power consumption and high efficiency in processing the non-Euclidean data represented by graphs. However, as a common problem, dynamic graph representation learning faces challenges such as high complexity and large memory overheads. Current work often uses SNNs instead of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) by using binary features instead of continuous ones for efficient training, which would overlooks graph structure information and leads to the loss of details during propagation. Additionally, optimizing dynamic spiking models typically requires propagation of information across time steps, which increases memory requirements. To address these challenges, we present a framework named \underline{Dy}namic \underline{S}p\underline{i}king \underline{G}raph \underline{N}eural Networks (\method{}). To mitigate the information loss problem, \method{} propagates early-layer information directly to the last layer for information compensation. To accommodate the memory requirements, we apply the implicit differentiation on the equilibrium state, which does not rely on the exact reverse of the forward computation. While traditional implicit differentiation methods are usually used for static situations, \method{} extends it to the dynamic graph setting. Extensive experiments on three large-scale real-world dynamic graph datasets validate the effectiveness of \method{} on dynamic node classification tasks with lower computational costs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into creative coding, yet how users reflect, and how different co-creation conditions influence reflective behavior, remains underexplored. This study investigates situated, moment-to-moment reflection in creative coding under two prompting strategies: the entire task invocation (T1) and decomposed subtask invocation (T2), to examine their effects on reflective behavior. Our mixed-method results reveal three distinct reflection types and show that T2 encourages more frequent, strategic, and generative reflection, fostering diagnostic reasoning and goal redefinition. These findings offer insights into how LLM-based tools foster deeper creative engagement through structured, behaviorally grounded reflection support.

<title>An In-depth Evaluation of Large Language Models in Sentence Simplification with Error-based Human Assessment</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04963</link>

Abstract: Recent studies have used both automatic metrics and human evaluations to assess the simplification abilities of LLMs. However, the suitability of existing evaluation methodologies for LLMs remains in question. First, the suitability of current automatic metrics on LLMs' simplification evaluation is still uncertain. Second, current human evaluation approaches in sentence simplification often fall into two extremes: they are either too superficial, failing to offer a clear understanding of the models' performance, or overly detailed, making the annotation process complex and prone to inconsistency, which in turn affects the evaluation's reliability. To address these problems, this study provides in-depth insights into LLMs' performance while ensuring the reliability of the evaluation. We design an error-based human annotation framework to assess the LLMs' simplification capabilities. We select both closed-source and open-source LLMs, including GPT-4, Qwen2.5-72B, and Llama-3.2-3B. We believe that these models offer a representative selection across large, medium, and small sizes of LLMs. Results show that LLMs generally generate fewer erroneous simplification outputs compared to the previous state-of-the-art. However, LLMs have their limitations, as seen in GPT-4's and Qwen2.5-72B's struggle with lexical paraphrasing. Furthermore, we conduct meta-evaluations on widely used automatic metrics using our human annotations. We find that these metrics lack sufficient sensitivity to assess the overall high-quality simplifications, particularly those generated by high-performance LLMs.

Abstract: Continuous graph neural networks (CGNNs) have garnered significant attention due to their ability to generalize existing discrete graph neural networks (GNNs) by introducing continuous dynamics. They typically draw inspiration from diffusion-based methods to introduce a novel propagation scheme, which is analyzed using ordinary differential equations (ODE). However, the implementation of CGNNs requires significant computational power, making them challenging to deploy on battery-powered devices. Inspired by recent spiking neural networks (SNNs), which emulate a biological inference process and provide an energy-efficient neural architecture, we incorporate the SNNs with CGNNs in a unified framework, named Continuous Spiking Graph Neural Networks (COS-GNN). We employ SNNs for graph node representation at each time step, which are further integrated into the ODE process along with time. To enhance information preservation and mitigate information loss in SNNs, we introduce the high-order structure of COS-GNN, which utilizes the second-order ODE for spiking representation and continuous propagation. Moreover, we provide the theoretical proof that COS-GNN effectively mitigates the issues of exploding and vanishing gradients, enabling us to capture long-range dependencies between nodes. Experimental results on graph-based learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed COS-GNN over competitive baselines.

Abstract: Attribution methods are primarily designed to study input component contributions to individual model predictions. However, some research applications require a summary of attribution patterns across the entire dataset to facilitate the interpretability of the scrutinized models at a task-level rather than an instance-level. It specifically applies when the localization of important input information is supposed to be stable for a specific problem but remains unidentified among numerous components. In this paper, we present a dataset-wise attribution method called Integrated Gradient Correlation (IGC) that enables region-specific analysis by a direct summation over associated components, and further relates the sum of all attributions to a model prediction score (correlation). We demonstrate IGC on synthetic data and fMRI neural signals (NSD dataset) with the study of the representation of image features in the brain and the estimation of the visual receptive field of neural populations. The resulting IGC attributions reveal selective patterns, coherent with respective model objectives.

<title>A Review of Reward Functions for Reinforcement Learning in the context of Autonomous Driving</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has emerged as an important approach for autonomous driving. A reward function is used in reinforcement learning to establish the learned skill objectives and guide the agent toward the optimal policy. Since autonomous driving is a complex domain with partly conflicting objectives with varying degrees of priority, developing a suitable reward function represents a fundamental challenge. This paper aims to highlight the gap in such function design by assessing different proposed formulations in the literature and dividing individual objectives into Safety, Comfort, Progress, and Traffic Rules compliance categories. Additionally, the limitations of the reviewed reward functions are discussed, such as objectives aggregation and indifference to driving context. Furthermore, the reward categories are frequently inadequately formulated and lack standardization. This paper concludes by proposing future research that potentially addresses the observed shortcomings in rewards, including a reward validation framework and structured rewards that are context-aware and able to resolve conflicts.

Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have revolutionized many areas of machine learning, particularly in natural language and data sequence processing. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has demonstrated its ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) a promising alternatives to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), we proposed a new neural networks architecture inspired by KAN and the LSTM, the Temporal Kolomogorov-Arnold Networks (TKANs). TKANs combined the strenght of both networks, it is composed of Recurring Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (RKANs) Layers embedding memory management. This innovation enables us to perform multi-step time series forecasting with enhanced accuracy and efficiency. By addressing the limitations of traditional models in handling complex sequential patterns, the TKAN architecture offers significant potential for advancements in fields requiring more than one step ahead forecasting.

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Preference Optimization (PO) are key processes for aligning Language Models (LMs) with human preferences post pre-training. While SFT excels in efficiency and PO in effectiveness, they are often combined sequentially without integrating their optimization objectives. This approach ignores the opportunities to bridge their paradigm gap and take the strengths from both. In this paper, we interpret SFT and PO with two sub-processes -- Preference Estimation and Transition Optimization -- defined at token level within the Markov Decision Process (MDP). This modeling shows that SFT is only a special case of PO with inferior estimation and optimization. PO estimates the model's preference by its entire generation, while SFT only scores model's subsequent predicted tokens based on prior tokens from ground truth answer. These priors deviates from model's distribution, hindering the preference estimation and transition optimization. Building on this view, we introduce Intuitive Fine-Tuning (IFT) to integrate SFT and PO into a single process. Through a temporal residual connection, IFT brings better estimation and optimization by capturing LMs' intuitive sense of its entire answers. But it solely relies on a single policy and the same volume of non-preference-labeled data as SFT. Our experiments show that IFT performs comparably or even superiorly to SFT and some typical PO methods across several tasks, particularly those require generation, reasoning, and fact-following abilities. An explainable Frozen Lake game further validates the effectiveness of IFT for getting competitive policy.

Abstract: Payload transport over flat terrain via multi-wheel robot carriers is well-understood, highly effective, and configurable. In this paper, our goal is to provide similar effectiveness and configurability for transport over rough terrain that is more suitable for legs rather than wheels. For this purpose, we consider multi-biped robot carriers, where wheels are replaced by multiple bipedal robots attached to the carrier. Our main contribution is to design a decentralized controller for such systems that can be effectively applied to varying numbers and configurations of rigidly attached bipedal robots without retraining. We present a reinforcement learning approach for training the controller in simulation that supports transfer to the real world. Our experiments in simulation provide quantitative metrics showing the effectiveness of the approach over a wide variety of simulated transport scenarios. In addition, we demonstrate the controller in the real-world for systems composed of two and three Cassie robots. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a scalable multi-biped payload transport system.

Abstract: Change point detection in time series aims to identify moments when the probability distribution of time series changes. It is widely applied in many areas, such as human activity sensing and medical science. In the context of multivariate time series, this typically involves examining the joint distribution of multiple variables: If the distribution of any one variable changes, the entire time series undergoes a distribution shift. However, in practical applications, we may be interested only in certain components of the time series, exploring abrupt changes in their distributions while accounting for the presence of other components. Here, assuming an underlying structural causal model that governs the time-series data generation, we address this task by proposing a two-stage non-parametric algorithm that first learns parts of the causal structure through constraint-based discovery methods, and then employs conditional relative Pearson divergence estimation to identify the change points. The conditional relative Pearson divergence quantifies the distribution difference between consecutive segments in the time series, while the causal discovery method allows a focus on the causal mechanism, facilitating access to independent and identically distributed (IID) samples. Theoretically, the typical assumption of samples being IID in conventional change point detection methods can be relaxed based on the Causal Markov Condition. Through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we validate the correctness and utility of our approach.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) enables researchers to automatically explore vast search spaces and find efficient neural networks. But NAS suffers from a key bottleneck, i.e., numerous architectures need to be evaluated during the search process, which requires a lot of computing resources and time. In order to improve the efficiency of NAS, a series of methods have been proposed to reduce the evaluation time of neural architectures. However, they are not efficient enough and still only focus on the accuracy of architectures. In addition to the classification accuracy, more efficient and smaller network architectures are required in real-world applications. To address the above problems, we propose the SMEM-NAS, a pairwise comparison relation-assisted multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on a multi-population mechanism. In the SMEM-NAS, a surrogate model is constructed based on pairwise comparison relations to predict the accuracy ranking of architectures, rather than the absolute accuracy. Moreover, two populations cooperate with each other in the search process, i.e., a main population guides the evolution, while a vice population expands the diversity. Our method aims to provide high-performance models that take into account multiple optimization objectives. We conduct a series of experiments on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets to verify its effectiveness. With only a single GPU searching for 0.17 days, competitive architectures can be found by SMEM-NAS which achieves 78.91% accuracy with the MAdds of 570M on the ImageNet. This work makes a significant advance in the important field of NAS. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/ccz-enas/SMEM-NAS.

Abstract: Contemporary research in social sciences increasingly utilizes state-of-the-art generative language models to annotate or generate content. While these models achieve benchmark-leading performance on common language tasks, their application to novel out-of-domain tasks remains insufficiently explored. To address this gap, we investigate how personalized language models align with human responses on the Moral Foundation Theory Questionnaire. We adapt open-source generative language models to different political personas and repeatedly survey these models to generate synthetic data sets where model-persona combinations define our sub-populations. Our analysis reveals that models produce inconsistent results across multiple repetitions, yielding high response variance. Furthermore, the alignment between synthetic data and corresponding human data from psychological studies shows a weak correlation, with conservative persona-prompted models particularly failing to align with actual conservative populations. These results suggest that language models struggle to coherently represent ideologies through in-context prompting due to their alignment process. Thus, using language models to simulate social interactions requires measurable improvements in in-context optimization or parameter manipulation to align with psychological and sociological stereotypes properly.

Abstract: Existing work on improving language model reasoning typically explores a single solution path, which can be prone to errors. Inspired by perspective-taking in social studies, this paper introduces DiPT, a novel approach that complements current reasoning methods by explicitly incorporating diversified viewpoints. This approach allows the model to gain a deeper understanding of the problem's context and identify the most effective solution path during the inference stage. Additionally, it provides a general data-centric AI recipe for augmenting existing data to improve their quality for fine-tuning.
  Our empirical results demonstrate that DiPT can be flexibly integrated into existing methods that focus on a single reasoning approach, enhancing their reasoning performance and stability when presented with paraphrased problems. Furthermore, we illustrate improved context understanding by maintaining the model's safe outputs against "jailbreaking" prompts intentionally designed to bypass safeguards built into deployed models. Lastly, we show that fine-tuning with data enriched with diverse perspectives can boost the reasoning capabilities of the model compared to fine-tuning with raw data alone.

Abstract: Verification and validation of autonomous driving (AD) systems and components is of increasing importance, as such technology increases in real-world prevalence. Safety-critical scenario generation is a key approach to robustify AD policies through closed-loop training. However, existing approaches for scenario generation rely on simplistic objectives, resulting in overly-aggressive or non-reactive adversarial behaviors. To generate diverse adversarial yet realistic scenarios, we propose SEAL, a scenario perturbation approach which leverages learned objective functions and adversarial, human-like skills. SEAL-perturbed scenarios are more realistic than SOTA baselines, leading to improved ego task success across real-world, in-distribution, and out-of-distribution scenarios, of more than 20%. To facilitate future research, we release our code and tools: https://github.com/cmubig/SEAL

Abstract: We present TheraGen, an advanced AI-powered mental health chatbot utilizing the LLaMA 2 7B model. This approach builds upon recent advancements in language models and transformer architectures. TheraGen provides all-day personalized, compassionate mental health care by leveraging a large dataset of 1 million conversational entries, combining anonymized therapy transcripts, online mental health discussions, and psychological literature, including APA resources. Our implementation employs transfer learning, fine-tuning, and advanced training techniques to optimize performance. TheraGen offers a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction, providing empathetic responses and evidence-based coping strategies. Evaluation results demonstrate high user satisfaction rates, with 94% of users reporting improved mental well-being. The system achieved a BLEU score of 0.67 and a ROUGE score of 0.62, indicating strong response accuracy.

Abstract: With the development of edge computing, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution for the intelligent Internet of Things (IoT). However, applying FL in mobile edge-cloud networks is greatly challenged by statistical heterogeneity and high communication overhead. To address it, we propose a hybrid federated learning framework called HFLDD, which integrates dataset distillation to generate approximately independent and equally distributed (IID) data, thereby improving the performance of model training. In particular, we partition the clients into heterogeneous clusters, where the data labels among different clients within a cluster are unbalanced while the data labels among different clusters are balanced. The cluster heads collect distilled data from the corresponding cluster members, and conduct model training in collaboration with the server. This training process is like traditional federated learning on IID data, and hence effectively alleviates the impact of non-IID data on model training. We perform a comprehensive analysis of the convergence behavior, communication overhead, and computational complexity of the proposed HFLDD. Extensive experimental results based on multiple public datasets demonstrate that when data labels are severely imbalanced, the proposed HFLDD outperforms the baseline methods in terms of both test accuracy and communication cost.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated their capabilities in modeling trajectories of multi-tasks. However, existing multi-task planners or policies typically rely on task-specific demonstrations via multi-task imitation, or require task-specific reward labels to facilitate policy optimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL). They are costly due to the substantial human efforts required to collect expert data or design reward functions. To address these challenges, we aim to develop a versatile diffusion planner capable of leveraging large-scale inferior data that contains task-agnostic sub-optimal trajectories, with the ability to fast adapt to specific tasks. In this paper, we propose SODP, a two-stage framework that leverages Sub-Optimal data to learn a Diffusion Planner, which is generalizable for various downstream tasks. Specifically, in the pre-training stage, we train a foundation diffusion planner that extracts general planning capabilities by modeling the versatile distribution of multi-task trajectories, which can be sub-optimal and has wide data coverage. Then for downstream tasks, we adopt RL-based fine-tuning with task-specific rewards to quickly refine the diffusion planner, which aims to generate action sequences with higher task-specific returns. Experimental results from multi-task domains including Meta-World and Adroit demonstrate that SODP outperforms state-of-the-art methods with only a small amount of data for reward-guided fine-tuning.

Abstract: With the trend of large graph learning models, business owners tend to employ a model provided by a third party to deliver business services to users. However, these models might be backdoored, and malicious users can submit trigger-embedded inputs to manipulate the model predictions. Current graph backdoor defenses have several limitations: 1) depending on model-related details, 2) requiring additional model fine-tuning, and 3) relying upon extra explainability tools, all of which are infeasible under stringent privacy policies. To address those limitations, we propose GraphProt, which allows resource-constrained business owners to rely on third parties to avoid backdoor attacks on GNN-based graph classifiers. Our GraphProt is model-agnostic and only relies on the input graph. The key insight is to leverage subgraph information for prediction, thereby mitigating backdoor effects induced by triggers. GraphProt comprises two components: clustering-based trigger elimination and robust subgraph ensemble. Specifically, we first propose feature-topology clustering that aims to remove most of the anomalous subgraphs (triggers). Moreover, we design subgraph sampling strategies based on feature-topology clustering to build a robust classifier via majority vote. Experimental results across three backdoor attacks and six benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphProt significantly reduces the backdoor attack success rate while preserving the model accuracy on regular graph classification tasks.

Abstract: Despite their success in many domains, large language models (LLMs) remain under-studied in scenarios requiring optimal decision-making under uncertainty. This is crucial as many real-world applications, ranging from personalized recommendations to healthcare interventions, demand that LLMs not only predict but also actively learn to make optimal decisions through exploration. In this work, we measure LLMs' (in)ability to make optimal decisions in bandits, a state-less reinforcement learning setting relevant to many applications. We develop a comprehensive suite of environments, including both context-free and contextual bandits with varying task difficulties, to benchmark LLMs' performance. Motivated by the existence of optimal exploration algorithms, we propose efficient ways to integrate this algorithmic knowledge into LLMs: by providing explicit algorithm-guided support during inference; and through algorithm distillation via in-context demonstrations and fine-tuning, using synthetic data generated from these algorithms. Impressively, these techniques allow us to achieve superior exploration performance with smaller models, surpassing larger models on various tasks. We conducted an extensive ablation study to shed light on various factors, such as task difficulty and data representation, that influence the efficiency of LLM exploration. Additionally, we conduct a rigorous analysis of the LLM's exploration efficiency using the concept of regret, linking its ability to explore to the model size and underlying algorithm.

Abstract: Fingerprinting large language models (LLMs) is essential for verifying model ownership, ensuring authenticity, and preventing misuse. Traditional fingerprinting methods often require significant computational overhead or white-box verification access. In this paper, we introduce UTF, a novel and efficient approach to fingerprinting LLMs by leveraging under-trained tokens. Under-trained tokens are tokens that the model has not fully learned during its training phase. By utilizing these tokens, we perform supervised fine-tuning to embed specific input-output pairs into the model. This process allows the LLM to produce predetermined outputs when presented with certain inputs, effectively embedding a unique fingerprint. Our method has minimal overhead and impact on model's performance, and does not require white-box access to target model's ownership identification. Compared to existing fingerprinting methods, UTF is also more effective and robust to fine-tuning and random guess.

Abstract: Unsupervised pretraining has been transformative in many supervised domains. However, applying such ideas to reinforcement learning (RL) presents a unique challenge in that fine-tuning does not involve mimicking task-specific data, but rather exploring and locating the solution through iterative self-improvement. In this work, we study how unlabeled offline trajectory data can be leveraged to learn efficient exploration strategies. While prior data can be used to pretrain a set of low-level skills, or as additional off-policy data for online RL, it has been unclear how to combine these ideas effectively for online exploration. Our method SUPE (Skills from Unlabeled Prior data for Exploration) demonstrates that a careful combination of these ideas compounds their benefits. Our method first extracts low-level skills using a variational autoencoder (VAE), and then pseudo-labels unlabeled trajectories with optimistic rewards and high-level action labels, transforming prior data into high-level, task-relevant examples that encourage novelty-seeking behavior. Finally, SUPE uses these transformed examples as additional off-policy data for online RL to learn a high-level policy that composes pretrained low-level skills to explore efficiently. In our experiments, SUPE consistently outperforms prior strategies across a suite of 42 long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks. Code: https://github.com/rail-berkeley/supe.

<title>TabDPT: Scaling Tabular Foundation Models on Real Data</title>

Abstract: Tabular data is one of the most ubiquitous sources of information worldwide, spanning a wide variety of domains. This inherent heterogeneity has slowed the development of Tabular Foundation Models (TFMs) capable of fast generalization to unseen datasets. In-Context Learning (ICL) has recently emerged as a promising solution for TFMs, enabling dynamic adaptation to new tasks without additional tuning. While many studies have attempted to re-purpose large language models for tabular ICL, they have had limited success, so recent works have focused on developing tabular-specific foundation models. In this work, we propose an approach to combine ICL-based retrieval with self supervised learning to train tabular foundation models. We also investigate the utility of real vs. synthetic data for model pre-training, and show that real data can contain useful signal not easily captured in synthetic training. Specifically, we show that incorporating real data during the pre-training phase can lead to significantly faster training and better downstream generalization to unseen data. Our resulting model, TabDPT, achieves top performance on both regression (CTR23) and classification (CC18) benchmarks. Importantly, we also demonstrate that with our pre-training procedure, scaling both model and data size leads to consistent performance improvements that follow power laws. This echoes scaling laws in LLMs and other foundation models, and suggests that Internet-scale TFMs can be achievable. We open-source our full pipeline: inference code including trained model weights can be found at github.com/layer6ai-labs/TabDPT-inference, and the training code to reproduce experiments can be found at github.com/layer6ai-labs/TabDPT-training.

Abstract: We study infinite-horizon average-reward reinforcement learning (RL) for Lipschitz MDPs, a broad class that subsumes several important classes such as linear and RKHS MDPs, function approximation frameworks, and develop an adaptive algorithm $\text{ZoRL}$ with regret bounded as $\mathcal{O}\big(T^{1 - d_{\text{eff.}}^{-1}}\big)$, where $d_{\text{eff.}}= 2d_\mathcal{S} + d_z + 3$, $d_\mathcal{S}$ is the dimension of the state space and $d_z$ is the zooming dimension. In contrast, algorithms with fixed discretization yield $d_{\text{eff.}} = 2(d_\mathcal{S} + d_\mathcal{A}) + 2$, $d_\mathcal{A}$ being the dimension of action space. $\text{ZoRL}$ achieves this by discretizing the state-action space adaptively and zooming into ''promising regions'' of the state-action space. $d_z$, a problem-dependent quantity bounded by the state-action space's dimension, allows us to conclude that if an MDP is benign, then the regret of $\text{ZoRL}$ will be small. The zooming dimension and $\text{ZoRL}$ are truly adaptive, i.e., the current work shows how to capture adaptivity gains for infinite-horizon average-reward RL. $\text{ZoRL}$ outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in experiments, thereby demonstrating the gains arising due to adaptivity.

Abstract: We present the Material Masked Autoencoder (MMAE), a self-supervised Vision Transformer pretrained on a large corpus of short-fiber composite images via masked image reconstruction. The pretrained MMAE learns latent representations that capture essential microstructural features and are broadly transferable across tasks. We demonstrate two key applications: (i) predicting homogenized stiffness components through fine-tuning on limited data, and (ii) inferring physically interpretable parameters by coupling MMAE with an interaction-based material network (IMN), thereby enabling extrapolation of nonlinear stress-strain responses. These results highlight the promise of microstructure foundation models and lay the groundwork for future extensions to more complex systems, such as 3D composites and experimental datasets.

Abstract: Interpretation is critical for disease diagnosis, but existing models struggle to balance predictive accuracy with human-understandable rationales. While large language models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning abilities, their clinical use is limited by high computational costs and restricted multimodal reasoning ability. Small language models (SLMs) are efficient but lack advanced reasoning for integrating multimodal medical data. In addition, both LLMs and SLMs lack domain knowledge for trustworthy reasoning. Therefore, we propose ClinRaGen, enhancing SLMs by leveraging LLM-derived reasoning ability via rationale distillation and domain knowledge injection for trustworthy multimodal rationale generation. Key innovations include a sequential rationale distillation framework that equips SLMs with LLM-comparable multimodal reasoning abilities, and a knowledge-augmented attention mechanism that jointly unifies multimodal representation from time series and textual data in the same encoding space, enabling it to be naturally interpreted by SLMs while incorporating domain knowledge for reliable rationale generation. Experiments on real-world medical datasets show that ClinRaGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in disease diagnosis and rationale generation, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining LLM-driven reasoning with knowledge augmentation for improved interpretability.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with equivariant properties have achieved significant success in modeling complex dynamic systems and molecular properties. However, their expressiveness ability is limited by: (1) Existing methods often overlook the over-smoothing issue caused by traditional GNN models, as well as the gradient explosion or vanishing problems in deep GNNs. (2) Most models operate on first-order information, neglecting that the real world often consists of second-order systems, which further limits the model's representation capabilities. To address these issues, we propose the \textbf{Du}al \textbf{S}econd-order \textbf{E}quivariant \textbf{G}raph \textbf{O}rdinary Differential Equation (\method{}) for equivariant representation. Specifically, \method{} apply the dual second-order equivariant graph ordinary differential equations (Graph ODEs) on graph embeddings and node coordinates, simultaneously. Theoretically, we first prove that \method{} maintains the equivariant property. Furthermore, we provide theoretical insights showing that \method{} effectively alleviates the over-smoothing problem in both feature representation and coordinate update. Additionally, we demonstrate that the proposed \method{} mitigates the exploding and vanishing gradients problem, facilitating the training of deep multi-layer GNNs. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of the proposed \method{} compared to baselines.

Abstract: Diffusion-based image editing models have made remarkable progress in recent years. However, achieving high-quality video editing remains a significant challenge. One major hurdle is the absence of open-source, large-scale video editing datasets based on real-world data, as constructing such datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Moreover, video data requires a significantly larger number of tokens for representation, which substantially increases the training costs for video editing models. Lastly, current video editing models offer limited interactivity, often making it difficult for users to express their editing requirements effectively in a single attempt. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a dataset VIVID-10M and a baseline model VIVID. VIVID-10M is the first large-scale hybrid image-video local editing dataset aimed at reducing data construction and model training costs, which comprises 9.7M samples that encompass a wide range of video editing tasks. VIVID is a Versatile and Interactive VIdeo local eDiting model trained on VIVID-10M, which supports entity addition, modification, and deletion. At its core, a keyframe-guided interactive video editing mechanism is proposed, enabling users to iteratively edit keyframes and propagate it to other frames, thereby reducing latency in achieving desired outcomes. Extensive experimental evaluations show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in video local editing, surpassing baseline methods in both automated metrics and user studies. The VIVID-10M dataset are open-sourced at https://kwaivgi.github.io/VIVID/.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based on transformers achieve cutting-edge results on a variety of applications. However, their enormous size and processing requirements hinder deployment on constrained resources. To enhance efficiency, binarization and Early Exit (EE) have proved to be effective solutions. However, binarization may lead to performance loss as reduced precision affects gradient estimation and parameter updates. Besides, research on EE mechanisms is still in its early stages. To address these challenges, we introduce Binarized Early Exit Transformer (BEExformer), the first-ever selective learning-based transformer integrating Binarization-Aware Training (BAT) with EE for efficient and fast textual inference. Each transformer block has an integrated Selective-Learn Forget Network (SLFN) to enhance contextual retention while eliminating irrelevant information. The BAT employs a differentiable second-order approximation to the sign function, enabling gradient computation that captures both the sign and magnitude of the weights. This aids in 21.30 times reduction in model size. The EE mechanism hinges on fractional reduction in entropy among intermediate transformer blocks with soft-routing loss estimation. This accelerates inference by reducing FLOPs by 52.08% and even improves accuracy by 2.89% by resolving the "overthinking" problem inherent in deep networks. Extensive evaluation through comparison with the SOTA methods and various ablations across six datasets covering multiple NLP tasks demonstrates its Pareto-optimal performance-efficiency trade-off.

Abstract: Reliable prediction of pediatric obesity can offer a valuable resource to providers, helping them engage in timely preventive interventions before the disease is established. Many efforts have been made to develop ML-based predictive models of obesity, and some studies have reported high predictive performances. However, no commonly used clinical decision support tool based on existing ML models currently exists. This study presents a novel end-to-end pipeline specifically designed for pediatric obesity prediction, which supports the entire process of data extraction, inference, and communication via an API or a user interface. While focusing only on routinely recorded data in pediatric electronic health records (EHRs), our pipeline uses a diverse expert-curated list of medical concepts to predict the 1-3 years risk of developing obesity. Furthermore, by using the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard in our design procedure, we specifically target facilitating low-effort integration of our pipeline with different EHR systems. In our experiments, we report the effectiveness of the predictive model as well as its alignment with the feedback from various stakeholders, including ML scientists, providers, health IT personnel, health administration representatives, and patient group representatives.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary Scene Graph Generation (OV-SGG) overcomes the limitations of the closed-set assumption by aligning visual relationship representations with open-vocabulary textual representations. This enables the identification of novel visual relationships, making it applicable to real-world scenarios with diverse relationships. However, existing OV-SGG methods are constrained by fixed text representations, limiting diversity and accuracy in image-text alignment. To address these challenges, we propose the Relation-Aware Hierarchical Prompting (RAHP) framework, which enhances text representation by integrating subject-object and region-specific relation information. Our approach utilizes entity clustering to address the complexity of relation triplet categories, enabling the effective integration of subject-object information. Additionally, we utilize a large language model (LLM) to generate detailed region-aware prompts, capturing fine-grained visual interactions and improving alignment between visual and textual modalities. RAHP also introduces a dynamic selection mechanism within Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which adaptively selects relevant text prompts based on the visual content, reducing noise from irrelevant prompts. Extensive experiments on the Visual Genome and Open Images v6 datasets demonstrate that our framework consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the challenges of open-vocabulary scene graph generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are empowering decision-making in several applications, including tool or API usage and answering multiple-choice questions (MCQs). However, incorrect outputs pose significant risks in high-stakes domains like healthcare and finance. To quantify LLM uncertainty and thereby mitigate these risks, recent works employ conformal prediction (CP), a model- and distribution-agnostic framework that uses LLM outputs to generate a \emph{prediction set} containing the true answer with high probability. Leveraging CP, we propose \emph{conformal revision of questions} (CROQ), which revises the question by narrowing down the available choices to those in the prediction set and asking the LLM the revised question. We expect LLMs to be more accurate on revised questions with fewer choices. Furthermore, we expect CROQ to be effective when the prediction sets from CP are small. Commonly used logit scores often lead to large sets, diminishing CROQ's effectiveness. To overcome this, we propose CP-OPT, an optimization framework to learn scores that minimize set sizes while maintaining coverage. Our extensive experiments on MMLU, ToolAlpaca, and TruthfulQA datasets with multiple LLMs show that CROQ improves accuracy over the standard inference, with more pronounced gains when paired with CP-OPT.

Abstract: The rapid advancement in large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text, raising concerns about the misuse of AI-generated content and making it critical to detect it. However, the task remains challenging, particularly in unseen domains or with unfamiliar LLMs. Leveraging LLM next-token distribution outputs offers a theoretically appealing approach for detection, as they encapsulate insights from the models' extensive pre-training on diverse corpora. Despite its promise, zero-shot methods that attempt to operationalize these outputs have met with limited success. We hypothesize that one of the problems is that they use the mean to aggregate next-token distribution metrics across tokens, when some tokens are naturally easier or harder to predict and should be weighted differently. Based on this idea, we propose the Perplexity Attention Weighted Network (PAWN), which uses the last hidden states of the LLM and positions to weight the sum of a series of features based on metrics from the next-token distribution across the sequence length. Although not zero-shot, our method allows us to cache the last hidden states and next-token distribution metrics on disk, greatly reducing the training resource requirements. PAWN shows competitive and even better performance in-distribution than the strongest baselines (fine-tuned LMs) with a fraction of their trainable parameters. Our model also generalizes better to unseen domains and source models, with smaller variability in the decision boundary across distribution shifts. It is also more robust to adversarial attacks, and if the backbone has multilingual capabilities, it presents decent generalization to languages not seen during supervised training, with LLaMA3-1B reaching a mean macro-averaged F1 score of 81.46% in cross-validation with nine languages.

Abstract: Accurate spatial-temporal (ST) prediction for dynamic systems, such as urban mobility and weather patterns, is crucial but hindered by complex ST correlations and the challenge of concurrently modeling long-term trends with short-term fluctuations. Existing methods often falter in these areas. This paper proposes the BiDepth Multimodal Neural Network (BDMNN), which integrates two key innovations: 1) a bidirectional depth modulation mechanism that dynamically adjusts network depth to comprehensively capture both long-term seasonality and immediate short-term events; and 2) a novel convolutional self-attention cell (CSAC). Critically, unlike many attention mechanisms that can lose spatial acuity, our CSAC is specifically designed to preserve crucial spatial relationships throughout the network, akin to standard convolutional layers, while simultaneously capturing temporal dependencies. Evaluated on real-world urban traffic and precipitation datasets, BDMNN demonstrates significant accuracy improvements, achieving a 12% Mean Squared Error (MSE) reduction in urban traffic prediction and a 15% improvement in precipitation forecasting over leading deep learning benchmarks like ConvLSTM, using comparable computational resources. These advancements offer robust ST forecasting for smart city management, disaster prevention, and resource optimization.

Abstract: Accurate detection of traffic anomalies is crucial for effective urban traffic management and congestion mitigation. We use the Spatiotemporal Generative Adversarial Network (STGAN) framework combining Graph Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks to capture complex spatial and temporal dependencies in traffic data. We apply STGAN to real-time, minute-by-minute observations from 42 traffic cameras across Gothenburg, Sweden, collected over several months in 2020. The images are processed to compute a flow metric representing vehicle density, which serves as input for the model. Training is conducted on data from April to November 2020, and validation is performed on a separate dataset from November 14 to 23, 2020. Our results demonstrate that the model effectively detects traffic anomalies with high precision and low false positive rates. The detected anomalies include camera signal interruptions, visual artifacts, and extreme weather conditions affecting traffic flow.

Abstract: Large Language Models have proven surprisingly effective at solving a wide range of tasks from just a handful of examples. However, their lack of reliability and modularity limits their capacity to tackle large problems that require many steps of reasoning. In response, researchers have proposed advanced pipelines that leverage domain-specific knowledge to chain smaller prompts, provide intermediate feedback and improve performance through search. However, the current complexity of writing, tuning, maintaining and improving such pipelines has limited their sophistication. We propose oracular programming, a foundational paradigm for building LLM-enabled applications that lets domain experts express high-level problem-solving strategies as programs with unresolved choice points. These choice points are resolved at runtime by LLMs, which generalize from user-provided examples of correct and incorrect decisions. An oracular program is composed of three orthogonal components: a strategy that consists in a nondeterministic program with choice points that can be reified into a search tree, a policy that specifies how to navigate this tree with the help of LLM oracles, and a set of demonstrations that describe successful and unsuccessful search tree navigation scenarios across diverse problem instances. Each component is expressed in a dedicated programming language and can be independently improved or substituted. We address the key programming language design challenges of modularly composing oracular programs and enforcing consistency between their components as they evolve.

Abstract: Many commercial Large Language Models (LLMs) are often closed-source, limiting developers to prompt tuning for aligning content generation with specific applications. While these models currently do not provide access to token logits, we argue that if such access were available, it would enable more powerful adaptation techniques beyond prompt engineering. In this paper, we propose a token-level probability reweighting framework that, given access to logits and a small amount of task-specific data, can effectively steer black-box LLMs toward application-specific content generation. Our approach views next-token prediction through the lens of supervised classification. We show that aligning black-box LLMs with task-specific data can be formulated as a label noise correction problem, leading to Plugin model -- an autoregressive probability reweighting model that operates solely on logits. We provide theoretical justification for why reweighting logits alone is sufficient for task adaptation. Extensive experiments with multiple datasets, LLMs, and reweighting models demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, advocating for broader access to token logits in closed-source models.

Abstract: Healthcare systems are struggling to meet the growing demand for neurological care, particularly in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). We propose that LLM-based generative AI systems can enhance clinician capabilities to approach specialist-level assessment and decision-making in ADRD care at scale. This article presents a comprehensive six-phase roadmap for responsible design and integration of such systems into ADRD care: (1) high-quality standardized data collection across modalities; (2) decision support; (3) clinical integration enhancing workflows; (4) rigorous validation and monitoring protocols; (5) continuous learning through clinical feedback; and (6) robust ethics and risk management frameworks. This human centered approach optimizes clinicians' capabilities in comprehensive data collection, interpretation of complex clinical information, and timely application of relevant medical knowledge while prioritizing patient safety, healthcare equity, and transparency. Though focused on ADRD, these principles offer broad applicability across medical specialties facing similar systemic challenges.

<title>Brain Latent Progression: Individual-based Spatiotemporal Disease Progression on 3D Brain MRIs via Latent Diffusion</title>

Abstract: The growing availability of longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) datasets has facilitated Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven modeling of disease progression, making it possible to predict future medical scans for individual patients. However, despite significant advancements in AI, current methods continue to face challenges including achieving patient-specific individualization, ensuring spatiotemporal consistency, efficiently utilizing longitudinal data, and managing the substantial memory demands of 3D scans. To address these challenges, we propose Brain Latent Progression (BrLP), a novel spatiotemporal model designed to predict individual-level disease progression in 3D brain MRIs. The key contributions in BrLP are fourfold: (i) it operates in a small latent space, mitigating the computational challenges posed by high-dimensional imaging data; (ii) it explicitly integrates subject metadata to enhance the individualization of predictions; (iii) it incorporates prior knowledge of disease dynamics through an auxiliary model, facilitating the integration of longitudinal data; and (iv) it introduces the Latent Average Stabilization (LAS) algorithm, which (a) enforces spatiotemporal consistency in the predicted progression at inference time and (b) allows us to derive a measure of the uncertainty for the prediction at the global and voxel level. We train and evaluate BrLP on 11,730 T1-weighted (T1w) brain MRIs from 2,805 subjects and validate its generalizability on an external test set comprising 2,257 MRIs from 962 subjects. Our experiments compare BrLP-generated MRI scans with real follow-up MRIs, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy compared to existing methods. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/LemuelPuglisi/BrLP.

Abstract: Post-hoc explanation methods for black-box models often struggle with faithfulness and human interpretability due to the lack of explainability in current neural architectures. Meanwhile, B-cos networks have been introduced to improve model explainability by proposing an architecture that removes bias terms and promotes input-weight alignment. Although B-cos networks have shown success in building explainable systems, their application has so far been limited to computer vision models and their associated training pipelines. In this work, we introduce B-cos LMs, i.e., B-cos language models (LMs) empowered for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Our approach directly transforms pre-trained language models into B-cos LMs by combining B-cos conversion and task fine-tuning, improving efficiency compared to previous methods. Our automatic and human evaluation results demonstrate that B-cos LMs produce more faithful and human interpretable explanations than post-hoc methods, while maintaining task performance comparable to conventional fine-tuning. Our in-depth analysis explores how B-cos LMs differ from conventionally fine-tuned models in their learning processes and explanation patterns. Finally, we are also the first to explore the transformation of decoder-only models to B-cos LMs for generation tasks.

<title>IPAD: Inverse Prompt for AI Detection -- A Robust and Explainable LLM-Generated Text Detector</title>

arXiv:2502.15902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have attained human-level fluency in text generation, which complicates the distinction between human-written and LLM-generated texts. This increases the risk of misuse and highlights the need for reliable detectors. Yet, existing detectors exhibit poor robustness on out-of-distribution (OOD) data and attacked data, which is critical for real-world scenarios. Also, they struggle to provide interpretable evidence to support their decisions, thus undermining the reliability. In light of these challenges, we propose IPAD (Inverse Prompt for AI Detection), a novel framework consisting of a Prompt Inverter that identifies predicted prompts that could have generated the input text, and two Distinguishers that examine the probability that the input texts align with the predicted prompts. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that IPAD outperforms the strongest baselines by 9.05% (Average Recall) on in-distribution data, 12.93% (AUROC) on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and 5.48% (AUROC) on attacked data. IPAD also performs robustly on structured datasets. Furthermore, an interpretability assessment is conducted to illustrate that IPAD enhances the AI detection trustworthiness by allowing users to directly examine the decision-making evidence, which provides interpretable support for its state-of-the-art detection results.

arXiv:2502.18448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Handling ambiguity and underspecification is an important challenge in natural language interfaces, particularly for tasks like text-to-SQL semantic parsing. We propose a modular approach that resolves ambiguity using natural language interpretations before mapping these to logical forms (e.g., SQL queries). Although LLMs excel at parsing unambiguous utterances, they show strong biases for ambiguous ones, typically predicting only preferred interpretations. We constructively exploit this bias to generate an initial set of preferred disambiguations and then apply a specialized infilling model to identify and generate missing interpretations. To train the infilling model, we introduce an annotation method that uses SQL execution to validate different meanings. Our approach improves interpretation coverage and generalizes across datasets with different annotation styles, database structures, and ambiguity types.

<title>No, of Course I Can! Deeper Fine-Tuning Attacks That Bypass Token-Level Safety Mechanisms</title>

Abstract: Leading language model (LM) providers like OpenAI and Anthropic allow customers to fine-tune frontier LMs for specific use cases. To prevent abuse, these providers apply filters to block fine-tuning on overtly harmful data. In this setting, we make three contributions: First, while past work has shown that safety alignment is "shallow", we correspondingly demonstrate that existing fine-tuning attacks are shallow -- attacks target only the first several tokens of the model response, and consequently can be blocked by generating the first several response tokens with an aligned model. Second, we conceptually illustrate how to make attacks deeper by introducing a new fine-tuning attack that trains models to first refuse harmful requests before answering them; this "refuse-then-comply" strategy bypasses shallow defenses and produces harmful responses that evade output filters. Third, we demonstrate the potency of our new fine-tuning attack by jailbreaking both open-source models equipped with defenses and production models, achieving attack success rates of 57% and 72% against GPT-4o and Claude Haiku, respectively. Our attack received a $2000 bug bounty from OpenAI and was acknowledged as a vulnerability by Anthropic. Our work undermines the notion that models are safe because they initially refuse harmful requests and broadens awareness of the scope of attacks that face production fine-tuning APIs.

<title>Class-Aware PillarMix: Can Mixed Sample Data Augmentation Enhance 3D Object Detection with Radar Point Clouds?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02687</link>

Abstract: Due to the significant effort required for data collection and annotation in 3D perception tasks, mixed sample data augmentation (MSDA) has been widely studied to generate diverse training samples by mixing existing data. Recently, many MSDA techniques have been developed for point clouds, but they mainly target LiDAR data, leaving their application to radar point clouds largely unexplored. In this paper, we examine the feasibility of applying existing MSDA methods to radar point clouds and identify several challenges in adapting these techniques. These obstacles stem from the radar's irregular angular distribution, deviations from a single-sensor polar layout in multi-radar setups, and point sparsity. To address these issues, we propose Class-Aware PillarMix (CAPMix), a novel MSDA approach that applies MixUp at the pillar level in 3D point clouds, guided by class labels. Unlike methods that rely a single mix ratio to the entire sample, CAPMix assigns an independent ratio to each pillar, boosting sample diversity. To account for the density of different classes, we use class-specific distributions: for dense objects (e.g., large vehicles), we skew ratios to favor points from another sample, while for sparse objects (e.g., pedestrians), we sample more points from the original. This class-aware mixing retains critical details and enriches each sample with new information, ultimately generating more diverse training data. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only significantly boosts performance but also outperforms existing MSDA approaches across two datasets (Bosch Street and K-Radar). We believe that this straightforward yet effective approach will spark further investigation into MSDA techniques for radar data.

Abstract: We introduce KodCode, a synthetic dataset that addresses the persistent challenge of acquiring high-quality, verifiable training data across diverse difficulties and domains for training Large Language Models for coding. Existing code-focused resources typically fail to ensure either the breadth of coverage (e.g., spanning simple coding tasks to advanced algorithmic problems) or verifiable correctness (e.g., unit tests). In contrast, KodCode comprises question-solution-test triplets that are systematically validated via a self-verification procedure. Our pipeline begins by synthesizing a broad range of coding questions, then generates solutions and test cases with additional attempts allocated to challenging problems. Finally, post-training data synthesis is done by rewriting questions into diverse formats and generating responses under a test-based reject sampling procedure from a reasoning model (DeepSeek R1). This pipeline yields a large-scale, robust and diverse coding dataset. KodCode is suitable for supervised fine-tuning and the paired unit tests also provide great potential for RL tuning. Fine-tuning experiments on coding benchmarks (HumanEval(+), MBPP(+), BigCodeBench, and LiveCodeBench) demonstrate that KodCode-tuned models achieve state-of-the-art performance, surpassing models like Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B.

Abstract: Autoregressive models (ARMs) have become the workhorse for sequence generation tasks, since many problems can be modeled as next-token prediction. While there appears to be a natural ordering for text (i.e., left-to-right), for many data types, such as graphs, the canonical ordering is less obvious. To address this problem, we introduce a variant of ARM that generates high-dimensional data using a probabilistic ordering that is sequentially inferred from data. This model incorporates a trainable probability distribution, referred to as an order-policy, that dynamically decides the autoregressive order in a state-dependent manner. To train the model, we introduce a variational lower bound on the log-likelihood, which we optimize with stochastic gradient estimation. We demonstrate experimentally that our method can learn meaningful autoregressive orderings in image and graph generation. On the challenging domain of molecular graph generation, we achieve state-of-the-art results on the QM9 and ZINC250k benchmarks, evaluated across key metrics for distribution similarity and drug-likeless.

Abstract: Can we simulate a sandbox society with generative agents to model human behavior, thereby reducing the over-reliance on real human trials for assessing public policies? In this work, we investigate the feasibility of simulating health-related decision-making, using vaccine hesitancy, defined as the delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite the availability of vaccination services (MacDonald, 2015), as a case study. To this end, we introduce the VacSim framework with 100 generative agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). VacSim simulates vaccine policy outcomes with the following steps: 1) instantiate a population of agents with demographics based on census data; 2) connect the agents via a social network and model vaccine attitudes as a function of social dynamics and disease-related information; 3) design and evaluate various public health interventions aimed at mitigating vaccine hesitancy. To align with real-world results, we also introduce simulation warmup and attitude modulation to adjust agents' attitudes. We propose a series of evaluations to assess the reliability of various LLM simulations. Experiments indicate that models like Llama and Qwen can simulate aspects of human behavior but also highlight real-world alignment challenges, such as inconsistent responses with demographic profiles. This early exploration of LLM-driven simulations is not meant to serve as definitive policy guidance; instead, it serves as a call for action to examine social simulation for policy development.

Abstract: SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, remains a global health concern due to its high transmissibility and evolving variants. Although vaccination efforts and therapeutic advancements have mitigated disease severity, emerging mutations continue to challenge diagnostics and containment strategies. As of mid-February 2025, global test positivity has risen to 11%, marking the highest level in over six months despite widespread immunization efforts. Newer variants demonstrate enhanced host cell binding, increasing both infectivity and diagnostic complexity. This study evaluates the effectiveness of deep transfer learning in delivering rapid, accurate, and mutation-resilient COVID-19 diagnosis from medical imaging, with a focus on scalability and accessibility. We developed an automated detection system using state-of-the-art CNNs, including VGG16, ResNet50, ConvNetXtTiny, MobileNet, NASNetMobile, and DenseNet121 among others, to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray and CT images. Among all the models evaluated, DenseNet121 emerged as the best-performing architecture for COVID-19 diagnosis using CT and X-ray images. It achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, with 96.9% precision, 98.9% recall, 97.9% F1-score and 99.8% AUC score, indicating a high degree of consistency and reliability in both detecting positive and negative cases. The confusion matrix showed minimal false positives and false negatives, underscoring the model's robustness in real-world diagnostic scenarios.

Abstract: Many studies suggest that LLMs have left wing leans. The article extends previous analysis of US presidential elections considering several virtual elections in multiple European countries. The analysis considers multiple LLMs and the results confirm the extent of the leaning. Furthermore, the results show that the leaning is not uniform between countries. Sometimes, models refuse to take a position in the virtual elections, but the refusal rate itself is not uniform between countries.

Abstract: Autonomous graphical user interface (GUI) agents powered by multimodal large language models have shown great promise. However, a critical yet underexplored issue persists: over-execution, where the agent executes tasks in a fully autonomous way, without adequate assessment of its action confidence to compromise an adaptive human-agent collaboration. This poses substantial risks in complex scenarios, such as those involving ambiguous user instructions, unexpected interruptions, and environmental hijacks. To address the issue, we introduce OS-Kairos, an adaptive GUI agent capable of predicting confidence levels at each interaction step and efficiently deciding whether to act autonomously or seek human intervention. OS-Kairos is developed through two key mechanisms: (i) collaborative probing that annotates confidence scores at each interaction step; (ii) confidence-driven interaction that leverages these confidence scores to elicit the ability of adaptive interaction. Experimental results show that OS-Kairos substantially outperforms existing models on our curated dataset featuring complex scenarios, as well as on established benchmarks such as AITZ and Meta-GUI, with 24.59\%$\sim$87.29\% improvements in task success rate. OS-Kairos facilitates an adaptive human-agent collaboration, prioritizing effectiveness, generality, scalability, and efficiency for real-world GUI interaction. The dataset and codes are available at https://github.com/Wuzheng02/OS-Kairos.

Abstract: This paper challenges the argument that generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is entitled to broad immunity from copyright law for reproducing copyrighted works without authorization due to a fair use defense. It examines fair use legal arguments and eight distinct substantive arguments, contending that every legal and substantive argument favoring fair use for GenAI applies equally, if not more so, to humans. Therefore, granting GenAI exceptional privileges in this domain is legally and logically inconsistent with withholding broad fair use exemptions from individual humans. It would mean no human would need to pay for virtually any copyright work again. The solution is to take a circumspect view of any fair use claim for mass copyright reproduction by any entity and focus on the first principles of whether permitting such exceptionalism for GenAI promotes science and the arts.

Abstract: The adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and model-based design within the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry has been hindered by the perception that using BIM authoring tools demands more effort than conventional 2D drafting. To enhance design efficiency, this paper proposes a BIM command recommendation framework that predicts the optimal next actions in real-time based on users' historical interactions. We propose a comprehensive filtering and enhancement method for large-scale raw BIM log data and introduce a novel command recommendation model. Our model builds upon the state-of-the-art Transformer backbones originally developed for large language models (LLMs), incorporating a custom feature fusion module, dedicated loss function, and targeted learning strategy. In a case study, the proposed method is applied to over 32 billion rows of real-world log data collected globally from the BIM authoring software Vectorworks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can learn universal and generalizable modeling patterns from anonymous user interaction sequences across different countries, disciplines, and projects. When generating recommendations for the next command, our approach achieves a Recall@10 of approximately 84%. The code is available at: https://github.com/dcy0577/BIM-Command-Recommendation.git

Abstract: In the traditional view of reinforcement learning, the agent's goal is to find an optimal policy that maximizes its expected sum of rewards. Once the agent finds this policy, the learning ends. This view contrasts with \emph{continual reinforcement learning}, where learning does not end, and agents are expected to continually learn and adapt indefinitely. Despite the clear distinction between these two paradigms of learning, much of the progress in continual reinforcement learning has been shaped by foundations rooted in the traditional view of reinforcement learning. In this paper, we first examine whether the foundations of traditional reinforcement learning are suitable for the continual reinforcement learning paradigm. We identify four key pillars of the traditional reinforcement learning foundations that are antithetical to the goals of continual learning: the Markov decision process formalism, the focus on atemporal artifacts, the expected sum of rewards as an evaluation metric, and episodic benchmark environments that embrace the other three foundations. We then propose a new formalism that sheds the first and the third foundations and replaces them with the history process as a mathematical formalism and a new definition of deviation regret, adapted for continual learning, as an evaluation metric. Finally, we discuss possible approaches to shed the other two foundations.

<title>Divergence of Empirical Neural Tangent Kernel in Classification Problems</title>

Abstract: This paper demonstrates that in classification problems, fully connected neural networks (FCNs) and residual neural networks (ResNets) cannot be approximated by kernel logistic regression based on the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) under overtraining (i.e., when training time approaches infinity). Specifically, when using the cross-entropy loss, regardless of how large the network width is (as long as it is finite), the empirical NTK diverges from the NTK on the training samples as training time increases. To establish this result, we first demonstrate the strictly positive definiteness of the NTKs for multi-layer FCNs and ResNets. Then, we prove that during training, % with the cross-entropy loss, the neural network parameters diverge if the smallest eigenvalue of the empirical NTK matrix (Gram matrix) with respect to training samples is bounded below by a positive constant. This behavior contrasts sharply with the lazy training regime commonly observed in regression problems. Consequently, using a proof by contradiction, we show that the empirical NTK does not uniformly converge to the NTK across all times on the training samples as the network width increases. We validate our theoretical results through experiments on both synthetic data and the MNIST classification task. This finding implies that NTK theory is not applicable in this context, with significant theoretical implications for understanding neural networks in classification problems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) guardrail systems are designed to protect against prompt injection and jailbreak attacks. However, they remain vulnerable to evasion techniques. We demonstrate two approaches for bypassing LLM prompt injection and jailbreak detection systems via traditional character injection methods and algorithmic Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) evasion techniques. Through testing against six prominent protection systems, including Microsoft's Azure Prompt Shield and Meta's Prompt Guard, we show that both methods can be used to evade detection while maintaining adversarial utility achieving in some instances up to 100% evasion success. Furthermore, we demonstrate that adversaries can enhance Attack Success Rates (ASR) against black-box targets by leveraging word importance ranking computed by offline white-box models. Our findings reveal vulnerabilities within current LLM protection mechanisms and highlight the need for more robust guardrail systems.

Abstract: Drug overdose remains a critical global health issue, often driven by misuse of opioids, painkillers, and psychiatric medications. Traditional research methods face limitations, whereas social media offers real-time insights into self-reported substance use and overdose symptoms. This study proposes an AI-driven NLP framework trained on annotated social media data to detect commonly used drugs and associated overdose symptoms. Using a hybrid annotation strategy with LLMs and human annotators, we applied traditional ML models, neural networks, and advanced transformer-based models. Our framework achieved 98% accuracy in multi-class and 97% in multi-label classification, outperforming baseline models by up to 8%. These findings highlight the potential of AI for supporting public health surveillance and personalized intervention strategies.

Abstract: Conventional Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) for Quantum Machine Learning typically rely on a fixed Hermitian observable, often built from Pauli operators. Inspired by the Heisenberg picture, we propose an adaptive non-local measurement framework that substantially increases the model complexity of the quantum circuits. Our introduction of dynamical Hermitian observables with evolving parameters shows that optimizing VQC rotations corresponds to tracing a trajectory in the observable space. This viewpoint reveals that standard VQCs are merely a special case of the Heisenberg representation.
  Furthermore, we show that properly incorporating variational rotations with non-local observables enhances qubit interaction and information mixture, admitting flexible circuit designs. Two non-local measurement schemes are introduced, and numerical simulations on classification tasks confirm that our approach outperforms conventional VQCs, yielding a more powerful and resource-efficient approach as a Quantum Neural Network.

Abstract: We design a suite of minimal algorithmic tasks that are a loose abstraction of open-ended real-world tasks. This allows us to cleanly and controllably quantify the creative limits of the present-day language model. Much like real-world tasks that require a creative, far-sighted leap of thought, our tasks require an implicit, open-ended stochastic planning step that either (a) discovers new connections in an abstract knowledge graph (like in wordplay, drawing analogies, or research) or (b) constructs new patterns (like in designing math problems or new proteins). In these tasks, we empirically and conceptually argue how next-token learning is myopic; multi-token approaches, namely teacherless training and diffusion models, comparatively excel in producing diverse and original output. Secondly, to elicit randomness without hurting coherence, we find that injecting noise at the input layer (dubbed seed-conditioning) works surprisingly as well as (and in some conditions, better than) temperature sampling from the output layer. Thus, our work offers a principled, minimal test-bed for analyzing open-ended creative skills, and offers new arguments for going beyond next-token learning and temperature sampling. We make part of the code available under https://github.com/chenwu98/algorithmic-creativity

<title>Avoiding Leakage Poisoning: Concept Interventions Under Distribution Shifts</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how concept-based models (CMs) respond to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. CMs are interpretable neural architectures that first predict a set of high-level concepts (e.g., stripes, black) and then predict a task label from those concepts. In particular, we study the impact of concept interventions (i.e., operations where a human expert corrects a CM's mispredicted concepts at test time) on CMs' task predictions when inputs are OOD. Our analysis reveals a weakness in current state-of-the-art CMs, which we term leakage poisoning, that prevents them from properly improving their accuracy when intervened on for OOD inputs. To address this, we introduce MixCEM, a new CM that learns to dynamically exploit leaked information missing from its concepts only when this information is in-distribution. Our results across tasks with and without complete sets of concept annotations demonstrate that MixCEMs outperform strong baselines by significantly improving their accuracy for both in-distribution and OOD samples in the presence and absence of concept interventions.

Abstract: The hallmark of effective language use lies in consistency: expressing similar meanings in similar contexts and avoiding contradictions. While human communication naturally demonstrates this principle, state-of-the-art language models (LMs) struggle to maintain reliable consistency across task- and domain-specific applications. Here we examine the landscape of consistency research in LMs, analyze current approaches to measure aspects of consistency, and identify critical research gaps. Our findings point to an urgent need for quality benchmarks to measure and interdisciplinary approaches to ensure consistency while preserving utility.

Abstract: We introduce RegionFocus, a visual test-time scaling approach for Vision Language Model Agents. Understanding webpages is challenging due to the visual complexity of GUI images and the large number of interface elements, making accurate action selection difficult. Our approach dynamically zooms in on relevant regions, reducing background clutter and improving grounding accuracy. To support this process, we propose an image-as-map mechanism that visualizes key landmarks at each step, providing a transparent action record and enables the agent to effectively choose among action candidates. Even with a simple region selection strategy, we observe significant performance gains of 28+\% on Screenspot-pro and 24+\% on WebVoyager benchmarks on top of two state-of-the-art open vision language model agents, UI-TARS and Qwen2.5-VL, highlighting the effectiveness of visual test-time scaling in interactive settings. We achieve a new state-of-the-art grounding performance of 61.6\% on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark by applying RegionFocus to a Qwen2.5-VL-72B model. Our code will be released publicly at https://github.com/tiangeluo/RegionFocus.

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence have highlighted the remarkable capabilities of neural network (NN)-powered systems on classical computers. However, these systems face significant computational challenges that limit scalability and efficiency. Quantum computers hold the potential to overcome these limitations and increase processing power beyond classical systems. Despite this, integrating quantum computing with NNs remains largely unrealized due to challenges posed by noise, decoherence, and high error rates in current quantum hardware. Here, we propose a novel quantum echo-state network (QESN) design and implementation algorithm that can operate within the presence of noise on current IBM hardware. We apply classical control-theoretic response analysis to characterize the QESN, emphasizing its rich nonlinear dynamics and memory, as well as its ability to be fine-tuned with sparsity and re-uploading blocks. We validate our approach through a comprehensive demonstration of QESNs functioning as quantum observers, applied in both high-fidelity simulations and hardware experiments utilizing data from a prototypical chaotic Lorenz system. Our results show that the QESN can predict long time-series with persistent memory, running over 100 times longer than the median T1 and T2 of the IBM Marrakesh QPU, achieving state-of-the-art time-series performance on superconducting hardware.

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has outpaced traditional evaluation methodologies. This progress presents novel challenges, such as measuring human-like psychological constructs, moving beyond static and task-specific benchmarks, and establishing human-centered evaluation. These challenges intersect with psychometrics, the science of quantifying the intangible aspects of human psychology, such as personality, values, and intelligence. This review paper introduces and synthesizes the emerging interdisciplinary field of LLM Psychometrics, which leverages psychometric instruments, theories, and principles to evaluate, understand, and enhance LLMs. The reviewed literature systematically shapes benchmarking principles, broadens evaluation scopes, refines methodologies, validates results, and advances LLM capabilities. Diverse perspectives are integrated to provide a structured framework for researchers across disciplines, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of this nascent field. Ultimately, the review provides actionable insights for developing future evaluation paradigms that align with human-level AI and promote the advancement of human-centered AI systems for societal benefit. A curated repository of LLM psychometric resources is available at https://github.com/valuebyte-ai/Awesome-LLM-Psychometrics.

Abstract: Long-form legal reasoning remains a key challenge for large language models (LLMs) in spite of recent advances in test-time scaling. We introduce LEXam, a novel benchmark derived from 340 law exams spanning 116 law school courses across a range of subjects and degree levels. The dataset comprises 4,886 law exam questions in English and German, including 2,841 long-form, open-ended questions and 2,045 multiple-choice questions. Besides reference answers, the open questions are also accompanied by explicit guidance outlining the expected legal reasoning approach such as issue spotting, rule recall, or rule application. Our evaluation on both open-ended and multiple-choice questions present significant challenges for current LLMs; in particular, they notably struggle with open questions that require structured, multi-step legal reasoning. Moreover, our results underscore the effectiveness of the dataset in differentiating between models with varying capabilities. Adopting an LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm with rigorous human expert validation, we demonstrate how model-generated reasoning steps can be evaluated consistently and accurately. Our evaluation setup provides a scalable method to assess legal reasoning quality beyond simple accuracy metrics. Project page: https://lexam-benchmark.github.io/

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have achieved notable progress in modeling discrete data, while their potential in molecular generation remains underexplored. In this work, we explore their potential and introduce the surprising result that naively applying standards MDMs severely degrades the performance. We identify the critical cause of this issue as a state-clashing problem-where the forward diffusion of distinct molecules collapse into a common state, resulting in a mixture of reconstruction targets that cannot be learned using typical reverse diffusion process with unimodal predictions. To mitigate this, we propose Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD) that orchestrates per-element corruption trajectories to avoid collision between distinct molecular graphs. This is achieved through a parameterized noise scheduling network that assigns distinct corruption rates to individual graph elements, i.e., atoms and bonds. Extensive experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks reveal that MELD markedly enhances overall generation quality compared to element-agnostic noise scheduling, increasing the chemical validity of vanilla MDMs on ZINC250K from 15% to 93%, Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art property alignment in conditional generation tasks.

Abstract: Serious Games (SGs) are nowadays shifting focus to include procedural content generation (PCG) in the development process as a means of offering personalized and enhanced player experience. However, the development of a framework to assess the impact of PCG techniques when integrated into SGs remains particularly challenging. This study proposes a methodology for automated evaluation of PCG integration in SGs, incorporating deep reinforcement learning (DRL) game testing agents. To validate the proposed framework, a previously introduced SG featuring card game mechanics and incorporating three different versions of PCG for nonplayer character (NPC) creation has been deployed. Version 1 features random NPC creation, while versions 2 and 3 utilize a genetic algorithm approach. These versions are used to test the impact of different dynamic SG environments on the proposed framework's agents. The obtained results highlight the superiority of the DRL game testing agents trained on Versions 2 and 3 over those trained on Version 1 in terms of win rate (i.e. number of wins per played games) and training time. More specifically, within the execution of a test emulating regular gameplay, both Versions 2 and 3 peaked at a 97% win rate and achieved statistically significant higher (p=0009) win rates compared to those achieved in Version 1 that peaked at 94%. Overall, results advocate towards the proposed framework's capability to produce meaningful data for the evaluation of procedurally generated content in SGs.

arXiv:2505.18373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that in-context learning (ICL) predictably arises from standard self-supervised next-token pretraining, rather than being an exotic emergent property. This work establishes the foundational principles of this emergence by focusing on in-distribution ICL, demonstrating how models necessarily adapt to context when trained on token sequences, especially from non-ergodic sources. Our information-theoretic framework precisely predicts these in-distribution ICL dynamics (i.e., context-dependent loss reduction). We verify this with experiments using synthetic datasets of differing types of correlational structure, reproducing characteristic phenomena like phase transitions in training loss for induction head formation and power-law scaling of in-context loss. We further show that a model's in-context performance on any task is mathematically coupled to the ensemble of tasks seen in pretraining, offering a fundamental explanation, grounded in architecture- and modality-independent principles, for such inference-time learning.

Abstract: This paper investigates the robustness of the Lur'e problem under positivity constraints, drawing on results from the positive Aizerman conjecture and robustness properties of Metzler matrices. Specifically, we consider a control system of Lur'e type in which not only the linear part includes parametric uncertainty but also the nonlinear sector bound is unknown. We investigate tools from positive linear systems to effectively solve the problems in complicated and uncertain nonlinear systems. By leveraging the positivity characteristic of the system, we derive an explicit formula for the stability radius of Lur'e systems. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to systems with neural network (NN) feedback loops. Building on this approach, we also propose a refinement method for sector bounds of NNs. This study introduces a scalable and efficient approach for robustness analysis of both Lur'e and NN-controlled systems. Finally, the proposed results are supported by illustrative examples.

Abstract: Despite the constant development of new bias mitigation methods for machine learning, no method consistently succeeds, and a fundamental question remains unanswered: when and why do bias mitigation techniques fail? In this paper, we hypothesise that a key factor may be the often-overlooked but crucial step shared by many bias mitigation methods: the definition of subgroups. To investigate this, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art bias mitigation methods across multiple vision and language classification tasks, systematically varying subgroup definitions, including coarse, fine-grained, intersectional, and noisy subgroups. Our results reveal that subgroup choice significantly impacts performance, with certain groupings paradoxically leading to worse outcomes than no mitigation at all. Our findings suggest that observing a disparity between a set of subgroups is not a sufficient reason to use those subgroups for mitigation. Through theoretical analysis, we explain these phenomena and uncover a counter-intuitive insight that, in some cases, improving fairness with respect to a particular set of subgroups is best achieved by using a different set of subgroups for mitigation. Our work highlights the importance of careful subgroup definition in bias mitigation and presents it as an alternative lever for improving the robustness and fairness of machine learning models.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, with UNet serving as a milestone architecture. The typical component of UNet family is the skip connection, however, their skip connections face two significant limitations: (1) they lack effective interaction between features at different scales, and (2) they rely on simple concatenation or addition operations, which constrain efficient information integration. While recent improvements to UNet have focused on enhancing encoder and decoder capabilities, these limitations remain overlooked. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale feature fusion method that reimagines the UNet decoding process as solving an initial value problem (IVP), treating skip connections as discrete nodes. By leveraging principles from the linear multistep method, we propose an adaptive ordinary differential equation method to enable effective multi-scale feature fusion. Our approach is independent of the encoder and decoder architectures, making it adaptable to various U-Net-like networks. Experiments on ACDC, KiTS2023, MSD brain tumor, and ISIC2017/2018 skin lesion segmentation datasets demonstrate improved feature utilization, reduced network parameters, and maintained high performance. The code is available at https://github.com/nayutayuki/FuseUNet.

Abstract: We present BIS Reasoning 1.0, the first large-scale Japanese dataset of syllogistic reasoning problems explicitly designed to evaluate belief-inconsistent reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior datasets such as NeuBAROCO and JFLD, which focus on general or belief-aligned reasoning, BIS Reasoning 1.0 introduces logically valid yet belief-inconsistent syllogisms to uncover reasoning biases in LLMs trained on human-aligned corpora. We benchmark state-of-the-art models - including GPT models, Claude models, and leading Japanese LLMs - revealing significant variance in performance, with GPT-4o achieving 79.54% accuracy. Our analysis identifies critical weaknesses in current LLMs when handling logically valid but belief-conflicting inputs. These findings have important implications for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains such as law, healthcare, and scientific literature, where truth must override intuitive belief to ensure integrity and safety.

Abstract: The growing gap between the increasing complexity of large language models (LLMs) and the limited computational budgets of edge devices poses a key challenge for efficient on-device inference, despite gradual improvements in hardware capabilities. Existing strategies, such as aggressive quantization, pruning, or remote inference, trade accuracy for efficiency or lead to substantial cost burdens. This position paper introduces a new framework that leverages speculative decoding, previously viewed primarily as a decoding acceleration technique for autoregressive generation of LLMs, as a promising approach specifically adapted for edge computing by orchestrating computation across heterogeneous devices. We propose \acronym, a framework that allows lightweight edge devices to draft multiple candidate tokens locally using diverse draft models, while a single, shared edge server verifies the tokens utilizing a more precise target model. To further increase the efficiency of verification, the edge server batch the diverse verification requests from devices. This approach supports device heterogeneity and reduces server-side memory footprint by sharing the same upstream target model across multiple devices. Our initial experiments with Jetson Orin Nano, Raspberry Pi 4B/5, and an edge server equipped with 4 Nvidia A100 GPUs indicate substantial benefits: 2.2 more system throughput, 2.8 more system capacity, and better cost efficiency, all without sacrificing model accuracy.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled multimodal foundation models to tackle both image understanding and generation within a unified framework. Despite these gains, unified models often underperform compared to specialized models in either task. A key challenge in developing unified models lies in the inherent differences between the visual features needed for image understanding versus generation, as well as the distinct training processes required for each modality. In this work, we introduce Pisces, an auto-regressive multimodal foundation model that addresses this challenge through a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored training techniques optimized for multimodal generation. Combined with meticulous data curation, pretraining, and finetuning, Pisces achieves competitive performance in both image understanding and image generation. We evaluate Pisces on over 20 public benchmarks for image understanding, where it demonstrates strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, on GenEval, a widely adopted benchmark for image generation, Pisces exhibits robust generative capabilities. Our extensive analysis reveals the synergistic relationship between image understanding and generation, and the benefits of using separate visual encoders, advancing the field of unified multimodal models.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, making early detection and accurate treatment response monitoring critical priorities. We present BreastDCEDL, a curated, deep learning-ready dataset comprising pre-treatment 3D Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) scans from 2,070 breast cancer patients drawn from the I-SPY1, I-SPY2, and Duke cohorts, all sourced from The Cancer Imaging Archive. The raw DICOM imaging data were rigorously converted into standardized 3D NIfTI volumes with preserved signal integrity, accompanied by unified tumor annotations and harmonized clinical metadata including pathologic complete response (pCR), hormone receptor (HR), and HER2 status. Although DCE-MRI provides essential diagnostic information and deep learning offers tremendous potential for analyzing such complex data, progress has been limited by lack of accessible, public, multicenter datasets. BreastDCEDL addresses this gap by enabling development of advanced models, including state-of-the-art transformer architectures that require substantial training data. To demonstrate its capacity for robust modeling, we developed the first transformer-based model for breast DCE-MRI, leveraging Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture trained on RGB-fused images from three contrast phases (pre-contrast, early post-contrast, and late post-contrast). Our ViT model achieved state-of-the-art pCR prediction performance in HR+/HER2- patients (AUC 0.94, accuracy 0.93). BreastDCEDL includes predefined benchmark splits, offering a framework for reproducible research and enabling clinically meaningful modeling in breast cancer imaging.

Abstract: Label Proportion Learning (LLP) addresses the classification problem where multiple instances are grouped into bags and each bag contains information about the proportion of each class. However, in practical applications, obtaining precise supervisory information regarding the proportion of instances in a specific class is challenging. To better align with real-world application scenarios and effectively leverage the proportional constraints of instances within tuples, this paper proposes a generalized learning framework \emph{MDPU}. Specifically, we first mathematically model the distribution of instances within tuples of arbitrary size, under the constraint that the number of positive instances is no less than that of negative instances. Then we derive an unbiased risk estimator that satisfies risk consistency based on the empirical risk minimization (ERM) method. To mitigate the inevitable overfitting issue during training, a risk correction method is introduced, leading to the development of a corrected risk estimator. The generalization error bounds of the unbiased risk estimator theoretically demonstrate the consistency of the proposed method. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and comparisons with other relevant baseline methods comprehensively validate the effectiveness of the proposed learning framework.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have revolutionized information retrieval and question answering, but traditional text-based chunking methods struggle with complex document structures, multi-page tables, embedded figures, and contextual dependencies across page boundaries. We present a novel multimodal document chunking approach that leverages Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to process PDF documents in batches while maintaining semantic coherence and structural integrity. Our method processes documents in configurable page batches with cross-batch context preservation, enabling accurate handling of tables spanning multiple pages, embedded visual elements, and procedural content. We evaluate our approach on a curated dataset of PDF documents with manually crafted queries, demonstrating improvements in chunk quality and downstream RAG performance. Our vision-guided approach achieves better accuracy compared to traditional vanilla RAG systems, with qualitative analysis showing superior preservation of document structure and semantic coherence.

Abstract: A key challenge in security analysis is the manual evaluation of potential security weaknesses generated by static application security testing (SAST) tools. Numerous false positives (FPs) in these reports reduce the effectiveness of security analysis. We propose using Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve the assessment of SAST findings. We investigate the ability of LLMs to reduce FPs while trying to maintain a perfect true positive rate, using datasets extracted from the OWASP Benchmark (v1.2) and a real-world software project. Our results indicate that advanced prompting techniques, such as Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency, substantially improve FP detection. Notably, some LLMs identified approximately 62.5% of FPs in the OWASP Benchmark dataset without missing genuine weaknesses. Combining detections from different LLMs would increase this FP detection to approximately 78.9%. Additionally, we demonstrate our approach's generalizability using a real-world dataset covering five SAST tools, three programming languages, and infrastructure files. The best LLM detected 33.85% of all FPs without missing genuine weaknesses, while combining detections from different LLMs would increase this detection to 38.46%. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs to complement traditional SAST tools, enhancing automation and reducing resources spent addressing false alarms.

Abstract: The effectiveness of AI debugging follows a predictable exponential decay pattern; most models lose 60-80% of their debugging capability within just 2-3 attempts, despite iterative debugging being a critical capability for practical code generation systems. We introduce the Debugging Decay Index (DDI), a mathematical framework that quantifies when debugging becomes ineffective and predicts intervention points. Our strategic fresh start approach shifts from exploitation to exploration at strategic points in the debugging process, demonstrating that well-timed interventions can rescue the effectiveness of debugging. DDI reveals a fundamental limitation in current AI debugging and provides the first quantitative framework for optimising iterative code generation strategies.

Abstract: The majority of data in businesses and industries is stored in tables, databases, and data warehouses. Reasoning with table-structured data poses significant challenges for large language models (LLMs) due to its hidden semantics, inherent complexity, and structured nature. One of these challenges is lacking an effective evaluation benchmark fairly reflecting the performances of LLMs on broad table reasoning abilities. In this paper, we fill in this gap, presenting a comprehensive table reasoning evolution benchmark, TReB, which measures both shallow table understanding abilities and deep table reasoning abilities, a total of 26 sub-tasks. We construct a high quality dataset through an iterative data processing procedure. We create an evaluation framework to robustly measure table reasoning capabilities with three distinct inference modes, TCoT, PoT and ICoT. Further, we benchmark over 20 state-of-the-art LLMs using this frame work and prove its effectiveness. Experimental results reveal that existing LLMs still have significant room for improvement in addressing the complex and real world Table related tasks. Both the dataset and evaluation framework are publicly available, with the dataset hosted on huggingface.co/datasets/JT-LM/JIUTIAN-TReB and the framework on github.com/JT-LM/jiutian-treb.

arXiv:2506.21278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture that employs a spherical Cauchy (spCauchy) latent distribution. Unlike traditional Gaussian latent spaces or the widely used von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution, spCauchy provides a more natural hyperspherical representation of latent variables, better capturing directional data while maintaining flexibility. Its heavy-tailed nature prevents over-regularization, ensuring efficient latent space utilization while offering a more expressive representation. Additionally, spCauchy circumvents the numerical instabilities inherent to vMF, which arise from computing normalization constants involving Bessel functions. Instead, it enables a fully differentiable and efficient reparameterization trick via M\"obius transformations, allowing for stable and scalable training. The KL divergence can be computed through a rapidly converging power series, eliminating concerns of underflow or overflow associated with evaluation of ratios of hypergeometric functions. These properties make spCauchy a compelling alternative for VAEs, offering both theoretical advantages and practical efficiency in high-dimensional generative modeling.

Abstract: Robotics has made remarkable hardware strides-from DARPA's Urban and Robotics Challenges to the first humanoid-robot kickboxing tournament-yet commercial autonomy still lags behind progress in machine learning. A major bottleneck is software: current robot stacks demand steep learning curves, low-level C/C++ expertise, fragmented tooling, and intricate hardware integration, in stark contrast to the Python-centric, well-documented ecosystems that propelled modern AI. We introduce ARK, an open-source, Python-first robotics framework designed to close that gap. ARK presents a Gym-style environment interface that allows users to collect data, preprocess it, and train policies using state-of-the-art imitation-learning algorithms (e.g., ACT, Diffusion Policy) while seamlessly toggling between high-fidelity simulation and physical robots. A lightweight client-server architecture provides networked publisher-subscriber communication, and optional C/C++ bindings ensure real-time performance when needed. ARK ships with reusable modules for control, SLAM, motion planning, system identification, and visualization, along with native ROS interoperability. Comprehensive documentation and case studies-from manipulation to mobile navigation-demonstrate rapid prototyping, effortless hardware swapping, and end-to-end pipelines that rival the convenience of mainstream machine-learning workflows. By unifying robotics and AI practices under a common Python umbrella, ARK lowers entry barriers and accelerates research and commercial deployment of autonomous robots.

Abstract: Exploration remains a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in environments with sparse or adversarial reward structures. In this work, we study how the architecture of deep neural policies implicitly shapes exploration before training. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate strategies for generating ballistic or diffusive trajectories from untrained policies in a toy model. Using the theory of infinite-width networks and a continuous-time limit, we show that untrained policies return correlated actions and result in non-trivial state-visitation distributions. We discuss the distributions of the corresponding trajectories for a standard architecture, revealing insights into inductive biases for tackling exploration. Our results establish a theoretical and experimental framework for using policy initialization as a design tool to understand exploration behavior in early training.

Abstract: Language models trained with reinforcement learning (RL) can engage in reward hacking--the exploitation of unintended strategies for high reward--without revealing this behavior in their chain-of-thought reasoning. This makes the detection of reward hacking difficult, posing risks for high-stakes applications. We propose verbalization fine-tuning (VFT), a pre-RL fine-tuning intervention that trains models to explicitly acknowledge when they are influenced by prompt cues--hints which point to incorrect answers (e.g., "a Stanford professor thinks the answer is A"). To evaluate VFT, we subsequently train models with RL on environments where held-out prompt cues signal which incorrect answers will receive high reward, incentivizing models to exploit these cues instead of reasoning correctly. We measure how often models exploit these cues without verbalizing it. After RL, only 6% of the VFT-trained model's responses consist of undetected reward hacks. In comparison, when we perform RL without VFT, the rate of undetected reward hacks goes up to 88%; with a debiasing baseline intervention, this increases further to 99%. VFT achieves this by substantially increasing how often models verbalize the influence of cues, from 8% to 43% after VFT, and up to 94% after RL. Baselines remain low even after RL (11% and 1%). Our results show that teaching models to explicitly verbalize reward hacking behavior before RL significantly improves their detection, offering a practical path toward more transparent and safe AI systems.

Abstract: Time series autoregression (AR) is a classical tool for modeling auto-correlations and periodic structures in real-world systems. We revisit this model from an interpretable machine learning perspective by introducing sparse autoregression (SAR), where $\ell_0$-norm constraints are used to isolate dominant periodicities. We formulate exact mixed-integer optimization (MIO) approaches for both stationary and non-stationary settings and introduce two scalable extensions: a decision variable pruning (DVP) strategy for temporally-varying SAR (TV-SAR), and a two-stage optimization scheme for spatially- and temporally-varying SAR (STV-SAR). These models enable scalable inference on real-world spatiotemporal datasets. We validate our framework on large-scale mobility and climate time series. On NYC ridesharing data, TV-SAR reveals interpretable daily and weekly cycles as well as long-term shifts due to COVID-19. On climate datasets, STV-SAR uncovers the evolving spatial structure of temperature and precipitation seasonality across four decades in North America and detects global sea surface temperature dynamics, including El Ni\~no. Together, our results demonstrate the interpretability, flexibility, and scalability of sparse autoregression for periodicity quantification in complex time series.

Abstract: Access to accurate and actionable harm reduction information can directly impact the health outcomes of People Who Use Drugs (PWUD), yet existing online channels often fail to meet their diverse and dynamic needs due to limitations in adaptability, accessibility, and the pervasive impact of stigma. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a novel opportunity to enhance information provision, but their application in such a high-stakes domain is under-explored and presents socio-technical challenges. This paper investigates how LLMs can be responsibly designed to support the information needs of PWUD. Through a qualitative workshop involving diverse stakeholder groups (academics, harm reduction practitioners, and an online community moderator), we explored LLM capabilities, identified potential use cases, and delineated core design considerations. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can address some existing information barriers (e.g., by offering responsive, multilingual, and potentially less stigmatising interactions), their effectiveness is contingent upon overcoming challenges related to ethical alignment with harm reduction principles, nuanced contextual understanding, effective communication, and clearly defined operational boundaries. We articulate design pathways emphasising collaborative co-design with experts and PWUD to develop LLM systems that are helpful, safe, and responsibly governed. This work contributes empirically grounded insights and actionable design considerations for the responsible development of LLMs as supportive tools within the harm reduction ecosystem.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are used in a variety of mission-critical roles. Due to the rapidly developing nature of LLMs, there is a lack of quantifiable understanding of the bias and perspective associated with LLM output. Inspired by this need, this paper considers the broader issue of perspective or viewpoint of general text and perspective control of large-language model (LLM) output. Perspective-Dial consists of two main components: a (1) metric space, dubbed Perspective Space, that enables quantitative measurements of different perspectives regarding a topic, and the use of (2) Systematic Prompt Engineering that utilizes greedy-coordinate descent to control LLM output perspective based on measurement feedback from the Perspective Space. The empirical nature of the approach allows progress to side step a principled understanding of perspective or bias -- effectively quantifying and adjusting outputs for a variety of topics. Potential applications include detection, tracking and mitigation of LLM bias, narrative detection, sense making and tracking in public discourse, and debate bot advocating given perspective.

Abstract: Test-time Adaptation (TTA) adapts a given model to testing domain data with potential domain shifts through online unsupervised learning, yielding impressive performance. However, to date, existing TTA methods primarily focus on single-model adaptation. In this work, we investigate an intriguing question: how does cross-model knowledge influence the TTA process? Our findings reveal that, in TTA's unsupervised online setting, each model can provide complementary, confident knowledge to the others, even when there are substantial differences in model size. For instance, a smaller model like MobileViT (10.6M parameters) can effectively guide a larger model like ViT-Base (86.6M parameters). In light of this, we propose COCA, a Cross-Model Co-Learning framework for TTA, which mainly consists of two main strategies. 1) Co-adaptation adaptively integrates complementary knowledge from other models throughout the TTA process, reducing individual model biases. 2) Self-adaptation enhances each model's unique strengths via unsupervised learning, enabling diverse adaptation to the target domain. Extensive experiments show that COCA, which can also serve as a plug-and-play module, significantly boosts existing SOTAs, on models with various sizes--including ResNets, ViTs, and Mobile-ViTs--via cross-model co-learned TTA. For example, with Mobile-ViT's guidance, COCA raises ViT-Base's average adaptation accuracy on ImageNet-C from 51.7% to 64.5%. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/ycarobot/COCA.

Abstract: Blending visual and textual concepts into a new visual concept is a unique and powerful trait of human beings that can fuel creativity. However, in practice, cross-modal conceptual blending for humans is prone to cognitive biases, like design fixation, which leads to local minima in the design space. In this paper, we propose a T2I diffusion adapter "IT-Blender" that can automate the blending process to enhance human creativity. Prior works related to cross-modal conceptual blending are limited in encoding a real image without loss of details or in disentangling the image and text inputs. To address these gaps, IT-Blender leverages pretrained diffusion models (SD and FLUX) to blend the latent representations of a clean reference image with those of the noisy generated image. Combined with our novel blended attention, IT-Blender encodes the real reference image without loss of details and blends the visual concept with the object specified by the text in a disentangled way. Our experiment results show that IT-Blender outperforms the baselines by a large margin in blending visual and textual concepts, shedding light on the new application of image generative models to augment human creativity.

Abstract: In order to increase the effectiveness of model training, data reduction is essential to data-centric AI. It does this by locating the most instructive examples in massive datasets. To increase data quality and training efficiency, the main difficulty is to choose the best examples rather than the complete datasets. In this paper, we propose an effective data reduction strategy based on Pointwise -Information (PVI). To enable a static method, we first use PVI to quantify instance difficulty and remove instances with low difficulty. Experiments show that the classifier performance is maintained with only a 0.0001% to 0.76% reduction in accuracy when 10%-30% of the data is removed. Second, we train the classifiers using a progressive learning strategy on examples sorted by increasing PVI, accelerating convergence and achieving a 0.8% accuracy gain over conventional training. Our findings imply that training a classifier on the chosen optimal subset may improve model performance and increase training efficiency when combined with an efficient data reduction strategy. Furthermore, we have adapted the PVI framework, which was previously limited to English datasets, to a variety of Chinese NLP tasks and base models, yielding insightful results for faster training and cross-lingual data reduction. The codes are released at https://github.com/zhouwenchi/DatasetReductionStrategy.

Abstract: The collection and release of street-level recordings as Open Data play a vital role in advancing autonomous driving systems and AI research. However, these datasets pose significant privacy risks, particularly for pedestrians, due to the presence of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that extends beyond biometric traits such as faces. In this paper, we present cRID, a novel cross-modal framework combining Large Vision-Language Models, Graph Attention Networks, and representation learning to detect textual describable clues of PII and enhance person re-identification (Re-ID). Our approach focuses on identifying and leveraging interpretable features, enabling the detection of semantically meaningful PII beyond low-level appearance cues. We conduct a systematic evaluation of PII presence in person image datasets. Our experiments show improved performance in practical cross-dataset Re-ID scenarios, notably from Market-1501 to CUHK03-np (detected), highlighting the framework's practical utility. Code is available at https://github.com/RAufschlaeger/cRID.

<title>DeltaSHAP: Explaining Prediction Evolutions in Online Patient Monitoring with Shapley Values</title>

Abstract: This study proposes DeltaSHAP, a novel explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) algorithm specifically designed for online patient monitoring systems. In clinical environments, discovering the causes driving patient risk evolution is critical for timely intervention, yet existing XAI methods fail to address the unique requirements of clinical time series explanation tasks. To this end, DeltaSHAP addresses three key clinical needs: explaining the changes in the consecutive predictions rather than isolated prediction scores, providing both magnitude and direction of feature attributions, and delivering these insights in real time. By adapting Shapley values to temporal settings, our approach accurately captures feature coalition effects. It further attributes prediction changes using only the actually observed feature combinations, making it efficient and practical for time-sensitive clinical applications. We also introduce new evaluation metrics to evaluate the faithfulness of the attributions for online time series, and demonstrate through experiments on online patient monitoring tasks that DeltaSHAP outperforms state-of-the-art XAI methods in both explanation quality as 62% and computational efficiency as 33% time reduction on the MIMIC-III decompensation benchmark. We release our code at https://github.com/AITRICS/DeltaSHAP.

<title>FlowSpec: Continuous Pipelined Speculative Decoding for Efficient Distributed LLM Inference</title>

Abstract: Distributed inference serves as a promising approach to enabling the inference of large language models (LLMs) at the network edge. It distributes the inference process to multiple devices to ensure that the LLMs can fit into the device memory. Recent pipeline-based approaches have the potential to parallelize communication and computation, which helps reduce inference latency. However, the benefit diminishes when the inference request at the network edge is sparse, where pipeline is typically at low utilization. To enable efficient distributed LLM inference at the edge, we propose \textbf{FlowSpec}, a pipeline-parallel tree-based speculative decoding framework. FlowSpec incorporates three key mechanisms to improve decoding efficiency: 1) score-based step-wise verification prioritizes more important draft tokens to bring earlier accpeted tokens; 2) efficient draft management to prune invalid tokens while maintaining correct causal relationship during verification; 3) dynamic draft expansion strategies to supply high-quality speculative inputs. These techniques work in concert to enhance both pipeline utilization and speculative efficiency. We evaluate FlowSpec on a real-world testbed with other baselines. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly improves inference speed across diverse models and configurations, achieving speedup ratios 1.28$\times$-1.79$\times$ compared to baselines. Our code is publicly available at \href{https://github.com/Leosang-lx/FlowSpec#}{https://github.com/Leosang-lx/FlowSpec\#}

<title>De-Fake: Style based Anomaly Deepfake Detection</title>

Abstract: Detecting deepfakes involving face-swaps presents a significant challenge, particularly in real-world scenarios where anyone can perform face-swapping with freely available tools and apps without any technical knowledge. Existing deepfake detection methods rely on facial landmarks or inconsistencies in pixel-level features and often struggle with face-swap deepfakes, where the source face is seamlessly blended into the target image or video. The prevalence of face-swap is evident in everyday life, where it is used to spread false information, damage reputations, manipulate political opinions, create non-consensual intimate deepfakes (NCID), and exploit children by enabling the creation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Even prominent public figures are not immune to its impact, with numerous deepfakes of them circulating widely across social media platforms. Another challenge faced by deepfake detection methods is the creation of datasets that encompass a wide range of variations, as training models require substantial amounts of data. This raises privacy concerns, particularly regarding the processing and storage of personal facial data, which could lead to unauthorized access or misuse. Our key idea is to identify these style discrepancies to detect face-swapped images effectively without accessing the real facial image. We perform comprehensive evaluations using multiple datasets and face-swapping methods, which showcases the effectiveness of SafeVision in detecting face-swap deepfakes across diverse scenarios. SafeVision offers a reliable and scalable solution for detecting face-swaps in a privacy preserving manner, making it particularly effective in challenging real-world applications. To the best of our knowledge, SafeVision is the first deepfake detection using style features while providing inherent privacy protection.

<title>An Efficient Deep Learning Framework for Brain Stroke Diagnosis Using Computed Tomography (CT) Images</title>

Abstract: Brain stroke is a leading cause of mortality and long-term disability worldwide, underscoring the need for precise and rapid prediction techniques. Computed Tomography (CT) scan is considered one of the most effective methods for diagnosing brain strokes. Most stroke classification techniques use a single slice-level prediction mechanism, requiring radiologists to manually select the most critical CT slice from the original CT volume. Although clinical evaluations are often used in traditional diagnostic procedures, machine learning (ML) has opened up new avenues for improving stroke diagnosis. To supplement traditional diagnostic techniques, this study investigates machine learning models for early brain stroke prediction using CT scan images. This research proposes a novel machine learning approach to brain stroke detection, focusing on optimizing classification performance with pre-trained deep learning models and advanced optimization strategies. Pre-trained models, including DenseNet201, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and Xception, are used for feature extraction. Feature engineering techniques, including BFO, PCA, and LDA, further enhance model performance. These features are then classified using machine learning algorithms, including SVC, RF, XGB, DT, LR, KNN, and GNB. Our experiments demonstrate that the combination of MobileNetV2, LDA, and SVC achieved the highest classification accuracy of 97.93%, significantly outperforming other model-optimizer-classifier combinations. The results underline the effectiveness of integrating lightweight pre-trained models with robust optimization and classification techniques for brain stroke diagnosis.

<title>From Video to EEG: Adapting Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture to Uncover Visual Concepts in Brain Signal Analysis</title>

Abstract: EEG signals capture brain activity with high temporal and low spatial resolution, supporting applications such as neurological diagnosis, cognitive monitoring, and brain-computer interfaces. However, effective analysis is hindered by limited labeled data, high dimensionality, and the absence of scalable models that fully capture spatiotemporal dependencies. Existing self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often focus on either spatial or temporal features, leading to suboptimal representations. To this end, we propose EEG-VJEPA, a novel adaptation of the Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) for EEG classification. By treating EEG as video-like sequences, EEG-VJEPA learns semantically meaningful spatiotemporal representations using joint embeddings and adaptive masking. To our knowledge, this is the first work that exploits V-JEPA for EEG classification and explores the visual concepts learned by the model. Evaluations on the publicly available Temple University Hospital (TUH) Abnormal EEG dataset show that EEG-VJEPA outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in classification accuracy. Beyond classification accuracy, EEG-VJEPA captures physiologically relevant spatial and temporal signal patterns, offering interpretable embeddings that may support human-AI collaboration in diagnostic workflows. These findings position EEG-VJEPA as a promising framework for scalable, trustworthy EEG analysis in real-world clinical settings.

Abstract: Understanding character relationships is essential for interpreting complex narratives and conducting socially grounded AI research. However, manual annotation is time-consuming and low in coverage, while large language models (LLMs) often produce hallucinated or logically inconsistent outputs. We present SymbolicThought, a human-in-the-loop framework that combines LLM-based extraction with symbolic reasoning. The system constructs editable character relationship graphs, refines them using seven types of logical constraints, and enables real-time validation and conflict resolution through an interactive interface. To support logical supervision and explainable social analysis, we release a dataset of 160 interpersonal relationships with corresponding logical structures. Experiments show that SymbolicThought improves annotation accuracy and consistency while significantly reducing time cost, offering a practical tool for narrative understanding, explainable AI, and LLM evaluation.

<title>Model Collapse Is Not a Bug but a Feature in Machine Unlearning for LLMs</title>

Abstract: Current unlearning methods for LLMs optimize on the private information they seek to remove by incorporating it into their training objectives. We argue this not only risks reinforcing exposure to sensitive data, it also fundamentally contradicts the principle of minimizing its use. As a remedy, we propose a novel unlearning method - Partial Model Collapse (PMC), which does not require unlearning targets in the unlearning objective. Our approach is inspired by recent observations that training generative models on their own generations leads to distribution collapse, effectively removing information from the model. Our core idea is to leverage this collapse for unlearning by triggering collapse partially on the sensitive data. We theoretically analyze that our approach converges to the desired outcome, i.e. the LLM unlearns the information in the forget set. We empirically demonstrate that PMC overcomes two key limitations of existing unlearning approaches that explicitly optimize on unlearning targets, and more effectively removes private information from model outputs. Overall, our contributions represent an important step toward more comprehensive unlearning that aligns with real-world privacy constraints.

Abstract: Cyclic peptides, characterized by geometric constraints absent in linear peptides, offer enhanced biochemical properties, presenting new opportunities to address unmet medical needs. However, designing target-specific cyclic peptides remains underexplored due to limited training data. To bridge the gap, we propose CP-Composer, a novel generative framework that enables zero-shot cyclic peptide generation via composable geometric constraints. Our approach decomposes complex cyclization patterns into unit constraints, which are incorporated into a diffusion model through geometric conditioning on nodes and edges. During training, the model learns from unit constraints and their random combinations in linear peptides, while at inference, novel constraint combinations required for cyclization are imposed as input. Experiments show that our model, despite trained with linear peptides, is capable of generating diverse target-binding cyclic peptides, reaching success rates from 38% to 84% on different cyclization strategies.

Abstract: Effective feedback is essential for student learning but is time-intensive for teachers. We present LearnLens, a modular, LLM-based system that generates personalised, curriculum-aligned feedback in science education. LearnLens comprises three components: (1) an error-aware assessment module that captures nuanced reasoning errors; (2) a curriculum-grounded generation module that uses a structured, topic-linked memory chain rather than traditional similarity-based retrieval, improving relevance and reducing noise; and (3) an educator-in-the-loop interface for customisation and oversight. LearnLens addresses key challenges in existing systems, offering scalable, high-quality feedback that empowers both teachers and students.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) personalization aims to align model outputs with individuals' unique preferences and opinions. While recent efforts have implemented various personalization methods, a unified theoretical framework that can systematically understand the drivers of effective personalization is still lacking. In this work, we integrate the well-established cognitive dual-memory model into LLM personalization, by mirroring episodic memory to historical user engagements and semantic memory to long-term, evolving user beliefs. Specifically, we systematically investigate memory instantiations and introduce a unified framework, PRIME, using episodic and semantic memory mechanisms. We further augment PRIME with a novel personalized thinking capability inspired by the slow thinking strategy. Moreover, recognizing the absence of suitable benchmarks, we introduce a dataset using Change My View (CMV) from Reddit, specifically designed to evaluate long-context personalization. Extensive experiments validate PRIME's effectiveness across both long- and short-context scenarios. Further analysis confirms that PRIME effectively captures dynamic personalization beyond mere popularity biases.

Abstract: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation shows great potential in fields such as film production. Despite significant advances, current V2A methods relying on global video information struggle with complex scenes and generating audio tailored to specific objects. To address these limitations, we introduce Hear-Your-Click, an interactive V2A framework enabling users to generate sounds for specific objects by clicking on the frame. To achieve this, we propose Object-aware Contrastive Audio-Visual Fine-tuning (OCAV) with a Mask-guided Visual Encoder (MVE) to obtain object-level visual features aligned with audio. Furthermore, we tailor two data augmentation strategies, Random Video Stitching (RVS) and Mask-guided Loudness Modulation (MLM), to enhance the model's sensitivity to segmented objects. To measure audio-visual correspondence, we designed a new evaluation metric, the CAV score. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework offers more precise control and improves generation performance across various metrics. Project Page: https://github.com/SynapGrid/Hear-Your-Click

Abstract: The paper presents our system developed for table question answering (TQA). TQA tasks face challenges due to the characteristics of real-world tabular data, such as large size, incomplete column semantics, and entity ambiguity. To address these issues, we propose a large language model (LLM)-powered and programming-based table reasoning framework, named TableReasoner. It models a table using the schema that combines structural and semantic representations, enabling holistic understanding and efficient processing of large tables. We design a multi-step schema linking plan to derive a focused table schema that retains only query-relevant information, eliminating ambiguity and alleviating hallucinations. This focused table schema provides precise and sufficient table details for query refinement and programming. Furthermore, we integrate the reasoning workflow into an iterative thinking architecture, allowing incremental cycles of thinking, reasoning and reflection. Our system achieves first place in both subtasks of SemEval-2025 Task 8.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical applications, the challenge of jailbreaking, where adversaries manipulate the models to bypass safety mechanisms, has become a significant concern. This paper presents a dynamic Stackelberg game framework to model the interactions between attackers and defenders in the context of LLM jailbreaking. The framework treats the prompt-response dynamics as a sequential extensive-form game, where the defender, as the leader, commits to a strategy while anticipating the attacker's optimal responses. We propose a novel agentic AI solution, the "Purple Agent," which integrates adversarial exploration and defensive strategies using Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). The Purple Agent actively simulates potential attack trajectories and intervenes proactively to prevent harmful outputs. This approach offers a principled method for analyzing adversarial dynamics and provides a foundation for mitigating the risk of jailbreaking.

Abstract: We introduce the LLM-Nash framework, a game-theoretic model where agents select reasoning prompts to guide decision-making via Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike classical games that assume utility-maximizing agents with full rationality, this framework captures bounded rationality by modeling the reasoning process explicitly. Equilibrium is defined over the prompt space, with actions emerging as the behavioral output of LLM inference. This approach enables the study of cognitive constraints, mindset expressiveness, and epistemic learning. Through illustrative examples, we show how reasoning equilibria can diverge from classical Nash outcomes, offering a new foundation for strategic interaction in LLM-enabled systems.

Abstract: What drives an agent to explore the world while also maintaining control over the environment? From a child at play to scientists in the lab, intelligent agents must balance curiosity (the drive to seek knowledge) with competence (the drive to master and control the environment). Bridging cognitive theories of intrinsic motivation with reinforcement learning, we ask how evolving internal representations mediate the trade-off between curiosity (novelty or information gain) and competence (empowerment). We compare two model-based agents using handcrafted state abstractions (Tabular) or learning an internal world model (Dreamer). The Tabular agent shows curiosity and competence guide exploration in distinct patterns, while prioritizing both improves exploration. The Dreamer agent reveals a two-way interaction between exploration and representation learning, mirroring the developmental co-evolution of curiosity and competence. Our findings formalize adaptive exploration as a balance between pursuing the unknown and the controllable, offering insights for cognitive theories and efficient reinforcement learning.

Abstract: A large class of Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) methods employs a machine learner to process the input entities, while relying on a reasoner based on First-Order Logic to represent and process more complex relationships among the entities. A fundamental role for these methods is played by the process of logic grounding, which determines the relevant substitutions for the logic rules using a (sub)set of entities. Some NeSy methods use an exhaustive derivation of all possible substitutions, preserving the full expressive power of the logic knowledge. This leads to a combinatorial explosion in the number of ground formulas to consider and, therefore, strongly limits their scalability. Other methods rely on heuristic-based selective derivations, which are generally more computationally efficient, but lack a justification and provide no guarantees of preserving the information provided to and returned by the reasoner. Taking inspiration from multi-hop symbolic reasoning, this paper proposes a parametrized family of grounding methods generalizing classic Backward Chaining. Different selections within this family allow us to obtain commonly employed grounding methods as special cases, and to control the trade-off between expressiveness and scalability of the reasoner. The experimental results show that the selection of the grounding criterion is often as important as the NeSy method itself.

<title>Quantum Federated Learning for Multimodal Data: A Modality-Agnostic Approach</title>

Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) has been recently introduced to enable a distributed privacy-preserving quantum machine learning (QML) model training across quantum processors (clients). Despite recent research efforts, existing QFL frameworks predominantly focus on unimodal systems, limiting their applicability to real-world tasks that often naturally involve multiple modalities. To fill this significant gap, we present for the first time a novel multimodal approach specifically tailored for the QFL setting with the intermediate fusion using quantum entanglement. Furthermore, to address a major bottleneck in multimodal QFL, where the absence of certain modalities during training can degrade model performance, we introduce a Missing Modality Agnostic (MMA) mechanism that isolates untrained quantum circuits, ensuring stable training without corrupted states. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed multimodal QFL method with MMA yields an improvement in accuracy of 6.84% in independent and identically distributed (IID) and 7.25% in non-IID data distributions compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: There is growing interest in giving AI agents access to cryptocurrencies as well as to the smart contracts that transact them. But doing so, this position paper argues, could lead to formidable new vectors of AI harm. To support this argument, we first examine the unique properties of cryptocurrencies and smart contracts that could lead to these new vectors of harm. Next, we describe each of these new vectors of harm in detail. Finally, we conclude with a call for more technical research aimed at preventing and mitigating these harms and, thereby making it safer to endow AI agents with cryptocurrencies and smart contracts.

Abstract: Abductive reasoning, reasoning for inferring explanations for observations, is often mentioned in scientific, design-related and artistic contexts, but its understanding varies across these domains. This paper reviews how abductive reasoning is discussed in epistemology, science and design, and then analyses how various computational systems use abductive reasoning. Our analysis shows that neither theoretical accounts nor computational implementations of abductive reasoning adequately address generating creative hypotheses. Theoretical frameworks do not provide a straightforward model for generating creative abductive hypotheses, computational systems largely implement syllogistic forms of abductive reasoning. We break down abductive computational systems into components and conclude by identifying specific directions for future research that could advance the state of creative abductive reasoning in computational systems.

Abstract: The emergence of autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents capable of tool usage has introduced new safety risks that go beyond traditional conversational misuse. These agents, empowered to execute external functions, are vulnerable to both user-initiated threats (e.g., adversarial prompts) and tool-initiated threats (e.g., malicious outputs from compromised tools). In this paper, we propose the first unified safety-alignment framework for tool-using agents, enabling models to handle both channels of threat via structured reasoning and sandboxed reinforcement learning. We introduce a tri-modal taxonomy, including benign, malicious, and sensitive for both user prompts and tool responses, and define a policy-driven decision model. Our framework employs a custom-designed sandbox environment that simulates real-world tool execution and allows fine-grained reward shaping. Through extensive evaluations on public and self-built benchmarks, including Agent SafetyBench, InjecAgent, and BFCL, we demonstrate that our safety-aligned agents significantly improve resistance to security threats while preserving strong utility on benign tasks. Our results show that safety and effectiveness can be jointly optimized, laying the groundwork for trustworthy deployment of autonomous LLM agents.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), have significantly enhanced their reasoning abilities. However, a critical gap persists: these models struggle with dynamic spatial interactions, a capability essential for real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce M2-Reasoning-7B, a model designed to excel in both general and spatial reasoning. Our approach integrates two key innovations: (1) a novel data pipeline that generates 294.2K high-quality data samples (168K for cold-start fine-tuning and 126.2K for RLVR), which feature logically coherent reasoning trajectories and have undergone comprehensive assessment; and (2) a dynamic multi-task training strategy with step-wise optimization to mitigate conflicts between data, and task-specific rewards for delivering tailored incentive signals. This combination of curated data and advanced training allows M2-Reasoning-7B to set a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) across 8 benchmarks, showcasing superior performance in both general and spatial reasoning domains.

<title>Multi-Agent LLMs as Ethics Advocates in AI-Based Systems</title>

Abstract: Incorporating ethics into the requirement elicitation process is essential for creating ethically aligned systems. Although eliciting manual ethics requirements is effective, it requires diverse input from multiple stakeholders, which can be challenging due to time and resource constraints. Moreover, it is often given a low priority in the requirements elicitation process. This study proposes a framework for generating ethics requirements drafts by introducing an ethics advocate agent in a multi-agent LLM setting. This agent critiques and provides input on ethical issues based on the system description. The proposed framework is evaluated through two case studies from different contexts, demonstrating that it captures the majority of ethics requirements identified by researchers during 30-minute interviews and introduces several additional relevant requirements. However, it also highlights reliability issues in generating ethics requirements, emphasizing the need for human feedback in this sensitive domain. We believe this work can facilitate the broader adoption of ethics in the requirements engineering process, ultimately leading to more ethically aligned products.

Abstract: We define several canonical problems related to contrastive explanations, each answering a question of the form ''Why P but not Q?''. The problems compute causes for both P and Q, explicitly comparing their differences. We investigate the basic properties of our definitions in the setting of propositional logic. We show, inter alia, that our framework captures a cardinality-minimal version of existing contrastive explanations in the literature. Furthermore, we provide an extensive analysis of the computational complexities of the problems. We also implement the problems for CNF-formulas using answer set programming and present several examples demonstrating how they work in practice.

<title>From Language to Logic: A Bi-Level Framework for Structured Reasoning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08501</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08501</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.08501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured reasoning over natural language inputs remains a core challenge in artificial intelligence, as it requires bridging the gap between unstructured linguistic expressions and formal logical representations. In this paper, we propose a novel \textbf{bi-level framework} that maps language to logic through a two-stage process: high-level task abstraction and low-level logic generation. At the upper level, a large language model (LLM) parses natural language queries into intermediate structured representations specifying the problem type, objectives, decision variables, and symbolic constraints. At the lower level, the LLM uses these representations to generate symbolic workflows or executable reasoning programs for accurate and interpretable decision making. The framework supports modular reasoning, enforces explicit constraints, and generalizes across domains such as mathematical problem solving, question answering, and logical inference. We further optimize the framework with an end-to-end {bi-level} optimization approach that jointly refines both the high-level abstraction and low-level logic generation stages. Experiments on multiple realistic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing baselines in accuracy, with accuracy gains reaching as high as 40\%. Moreover, the bi-level design enhances transparency and error traceability, offering a promising step toward trustworthy and systematic reasoning with LLMs.

<title>A Multi-granularity Concept Sparse Activation and Hierarchical Knowledge Graph Fusion Framework for Rare Disease Diagnosis</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.08529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite advances from medical large language models in healthcare, rare-disease diagnosis remains hampered by insufficient knowledge-representation depth, limited concept understanding, and constrained clinical reasoning. We propose a framework that couples multi-granularity sparse activation of medical concepts with a hierarchical knowledge graph. Four complementary matching algorithms, diversity control, and a five-level fallback strategy enable precise concept activation, while a three-layer knowledge graph (taxonomy, clinical features, instances) provides structured, up-to-date context. Experiments on the BioASQ rare-disease QA set show BLEU gains of 0.09, ROUGE gains of 0.05, and accuracy gains of 0.12, with peak accuracy of 0.89 approaching the 0.90 clinical threshold. Expert evaluation confirms improvements in information quality, reasoning, and professional expression, suggesting our approach shortens the "diagnostic odyssey" for rare-disease patients.

<title>Large Multi-modal Model Cartographic Map Comprehension for Textual Locality Georeferencing</title>

Abstract: Millions of biological sample records collected in the last few centuries archived in natural history collections are un-georeferenced. Georeferencing complex locality descriptions associated with these collection samples is a highly labour-intensive task collection agencies struggle with. None of the existing automated methods exploit maps that are an essential tool for georeferencing complex relations. We present preliminary experiments and results of a novel method that exploits multi-modal capabilities of recent Large Multi-Modal Models (LMM). This method enables the model to visually contextualize spatial relations it reads in the locality description. We use a grid-based approach to adapt these auto-regressive models for this task in a zero-shot setting. Our experiments conducted on a small manually annotated dataset show impressive results for our approach ($\sim$1 km Average distance error) compared to uni-modal georeferencing with Large Language Models and existing georeferencing tools. The paper also discusses the findings of the experiments in light of an LMM's ability to comprehend fine-grained maps. Motivated by these results, a practical framework is proposed to integrate this method into a georeferencing workflow.

<title>Unlocking Speech Instruction Data Potential with Query Rewriting</title>

Abstract: End-to-end Large Speech Language Models~(\textbf{LSLMs}) demonstrate strong potential in response latency and speech comprehension capabilities, showcasing general intelligence across speech understanding tasks. However, the ability to follow speech instructions has not been fully realized due to the lack of datasets and heavily biased training tasks. Leveraging the rich ASR datasets, previous approaches have used Large Language Models~(\textbf{LLMs}) to continue the linguistic information of speech to construct speech instruction datasets. Yet, due to the gap between LLM-generated results and real human responses, the continuation methods further amplify these shortcomings. Given the high costs of collecting and annotating speech instruction datasets by humans, using speech synthesis to construct large-scale speech instruction datasets has become a balanced and robust alternative. Although modern Text-To-Speech~(\textbf{TTS}) models have achieved near-human-level synthesis quality, it is challenging to appropriately convert out-of-distribution text instruction to speech due to the limitations of the training data distribution in TTS models. To address this issue, we propose a query rewriting framework with multi-LLM knowledge fusion, employing multiple agents to annotate and validate the synthesized speech, making it possible to construct high-quality speech instruction datasets without relying on human annotation. Experiments show that this method can transform text instructions into distributions more suitable for TTS models for speech synthesis through zero-shot rewriting, increasing data usability from 72\% to 93\%. It also demonstrates unique advantages in rewriting tasks that require complex knowledge and context-related abilities.

Abstract: Early-stage engineering design involves complex, iterative reasoning, yet existing large language model (LLM) workflows struggle to maintain task continuity and generate executable models. We evaluate whether a structured multi-agent system (MAS) can more effectively manage requirements extraction, functional decomposition, and simulator code generation than a simpler two-agent system (2AS). The target application is a solar-powered water filtration system as described in a cahier des charges. We introduce the Design-State Graph (DSG), a JSON-serializable representation that bundles requirements, physical embodiments, and Python-based physics models into graph nodes. A nine-role MAS iteratively builds and refines the DSG, while the 2AS collapses the process to a Generator-Reflector loop. Both systems run a total of 60 experiments (2 LLMs - Llama 3.3 70B vs reasoning-distilled DeepSeek R1 70B x 2 agent configurations x 3 temperatures x 5 seeds). We report a JSON validity, requirement coverage, embodiment presence, code compatibility, workflow completion, runtime, and graph size. Across all runs, both MAS and 2AS maintained perfect JSON integrity and embodiment tagging. Requirement coverage remained minimal (less than 20\%). Code compatibility peaked at 100\% under specific 2AS settings but averaged below 50\% for MAS. Only the reasoning-distilled model reliably flagged workflow completion. Powered by DeepSeek R1 70B, the MAS generated more granular DSGs (average 5-6 nodes) whereas 2AS mode-collapsed. Structured multi-agent orchestration enhanced design detail. Reasoning-distilled LLM improved completion rates, yet low requirements and fidelity gaps in coding persisted.

Abstract: We introduce our Leanabell-Prover-V2, a 7B large language models (LLMs) that can produce formal theorem proofs in Lean 4, with verifier-integrated Long Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT). Following our previous work Leanabell-Prover-V1, we continual to choose to posttrain existing strong prover models for further performance improvement. In our V2 version, we mainly upgrade the Reinforcement Learning (RL) with feedback provided by the Lean 4 verifier. Crucially, verifier feedback, such as indicating success or detailing specific errors, allows the LLM to become ``self-aware'' of the correctness of its own reasoning process and learn to reflexively correct errors. Leanabell-Prover-V2 directly optimizes LLM reasoning trajectories with multi-turn verifier interactions, together with feedback token masking for stable RL training and a simple reward strategy. Experiments show that Leanabell-Prover-V2 improves performance by 3.2% (pass@128) with Kimina-Prover-Preview-Distill-7B and 2.0% (pass@128) with DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B on the MiniF2F test set.

Abstract: AI Agents rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal-LLMs (MLLMs) to perform interpretation and inference in text and image tasks without post-training, where LLMs and MLLMs play the most critical role and determine the initial ability and limitations of AI Agents. Usually, AI Agents utilize sophisticated prompt engineering and external reasoning framework to obtain a promising interaction with LLMs, e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Iteration of Thought and Image-of-Thought. However, they are still constrained by the inherent limitations of LLM in understanding natural language, and the iterative reasoning process will generate a large amount of inference cost. To this end, we propose a novel AI Agent Reasoning Framework with Introspection of Thought (INoT) by designing a new LLM-Read code in prompt. It enables LLM to execute programmatic dialogue reasoning processes following the code in prompt. Therefore, self-denial and reflection occur within LLM instead of outside LLM, which can reduce token cost effectively. Through our experiments on six benchmarks for three different tasks, the effectiveness of INoT is verified, with an average improvement of 7.95\% in performance, exceeding the baselines. Furthermore, the token cost of INoT is lower on average than the best performing method at baseline by 58.3\%. In addition, we demonstrate the versatility of INoT in image interpretation and inference through verification experiments.

Empirical results indicate that these instructions \textit{can} improve a reinforcement learning agent's performance. Therefore, we present this work to accelerate the evaluation of language solutions on reward based environments to enable new opportunities for scientific discovery.

In this context, for system-of-systems the use of efficient dedicated approaches (often physics-based simulations) is highly recommended to reduce the computational complexity of the targeted applications. However, exploring novel architectures using such dedicated approaches might pose challenges for optimization algorithms, including increased evaluation costs and potential failures. To address these challenges, surrogate-based optimization algorithms, such as Bayesian optimization utilizing Gaussian process models have emerged.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of wounds and scale markers in clinical images remainsa significant challenge, crucial for effective wound management and automatedassessment. In this study, we propose a novel dual-attention U-Net++ archi-tecture, integrating channel-wise (SCSE) and spatial attention mechanisms toaddress severe class imbalance and variability in medical images effectively.Initially, extensive benchmarking across diverse architectures and encoders via 5-fold cross-validation identified EfficientNet-B7 as the optimal encoder backbone.Subsequently, we independently trained two class-specific models with tailoredpreprocessing, extensive data augmentation, and Bayesian hyperparameter tun-ing (WandB sweeps). The final model ensemble utilized Test Time Augmentationto further enhance prediction reliability. Our approach was evaluated on a bench-mark dataset from the NBC 2025 & PCBBE 2025 competition. Segmentationperformance was quantified using a weighted F1-score (75% wounds, 25% scalemarkers), calculated externally by competition organizers on undisclosed hard-ware. The proposed approach achieved an F1-score of 0.8640, underscoring itseffectiveness for complex medical segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Thematic analysis provides valuable insights into participants' experiences through coding and theme development, but its resource-intensive nature limits its use in large healthcare studies. Large language models (LLMs) can analyze text at scale and identify key content automatically, potentially addressing these challenges. However, their application in mental health interviews needs comparison with traditional human analysis. This study evaluates out-of-the-box and knowledge-base LLM-based thematic analysis against traditional methods using transcripts from a stress-reduction trial with healthcare workers. OpenAI's GPT-4o model was used along with the Role, Instructions, Steps, End-Goal, Narrowing (RISEN) prompt engineering framework and compared to human analysis in Dedoose. Each approach developed codes, noted saturation points, applied codes to excerpts for a subset of participants (n = 20), and synthesized data into themes. Outputs and performance metrics were compared directly. LLMs using the RISEN framework developed deductive parent codes similar to human codes, but humans excelled in inductive child code development and theme synthesis. Knowledge-based LLMs reached coding saturation with fewer transcripts (10-15) than the out-of-the-box model (15-20) and humans (90-99). The out-of-the-box LLM identified a comparable number of excerpts to human researchers, showing strong inter-rater reliability (K = 0.84), though the knowledge-based LLM produced fewer excerpts. Human excerpts were longer and involved multiple codes per excerpt, while LLMs typically applied one code. Overall, LLM-based thematic analysis proved more cost-effective but lacked the depth of human analysis. LLMs can transform qualitative analysis in mental healthcare and clinical research when combined with human oversight to balance participant perspectives and research resources.

Abstract: A Prompt-based Text-To-Speech model allows a user to control different aspects of speech, such as speaking rate and perceived gender, through natural language instruction. Although user-friendly, such approaches are on one hand constrained: control is limited to acoustic features exposed to the model during training, and too flexible on the other: the same inputs yields uncontrollable variation that are reflected in the corpus statistics.
  We investigate a novel fine-tuning regime to address both of these issues at the same time by exploiting the uncontrollable variance of the model. Through principal component analysis of thousands of synthesised samples, we determine latent features that account for the highest proportion of the output variance and incorporate them as new labels for secondary fine-tuning. We evaluate the proposed methods on two models trained on an expressive Icelandic speech corpus, one with emotional disclosure and one without. In the case of the model without emotional disclosure, the method yields both continuous and discrete features that improve overall controllability of the model.

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have been driven bypretrained language models like BERT, RoBERTa, T5, and GPT. Thesemodels excel at understanding complex texts, but biomedical literature, withits domain-specific terminology, poses challenges that models likeWord2Vec and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) can't fullyaddress. GPT and T5, despite capturing context, fall short in tasks needingbidirectional understanding, unlike BERT. Addressing this, we proposedMedicalBERT, a pretrained BERT model trained on a large biomedicaldataset and equipped with domain-specific vocabulary that enhances thecomprehension of biomedical terminology. MedicalBERT model is furtheroptimized and fine-tuned to address diverse tasks, including named entityrecognition, relation extraction, question answering, sentence similarity, anddocument classification. Performance metrics such as the F1-score,accuracy, and Pearson correlation are employed to showcase the efficiencyof our model in comparison to other BERT-based models such as BioBERT,SciBERT, and ClinicalBERT. MedicalBERT outperforms these models onmost of the benchmarks, and surpasses the general-purpose BERT model by5.67% on average across all the tasks evaluated respectively. This work alsounderscores the potential of leveraging pretrained BERT models for medicalNLP tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer learning techniques incapturing domain-specific information.

<title>Mass-Scale Analysis of In-the-Wild Conversations Reveals Complexity Bounds on LLM Jailbreaking</title>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly deployed, understanding the complexity and evolution of jailbreaking strategies is critical for AI safety.
  We present a mass-scale empirical analysis of jailbreak complexity across over 2 million real-world conversations from diverse platforms, including dedicated jailbreaking communities and general-purpose chatbots. Using a range of complexity metrics spanning probabilistic measures, lexical diversity, compression ratios, and cognitive load indicators, we find that jailbreak attempts do not exhibit significantly higher complexity than normal conversations. This pattern holds consistently across specialized jailbreaking communities and general user populations, suggesting practical bounds on attack sophistication. Temporal analysis reveals that while user attack toxicity and complexity remains stable over time, assistant response toxicity has decreased, indicating improving safety mechanisms. The absence of power-law scaling in complexity distributions further points to natural limits on jailbreak development.
  Our findings challenge the prevailing narrative of an escalating arms race between attackers and defenders, instead suggesting that LLM safety evolution is bounded by human ingenuity constraints while defensive measures continue advancing. Our results highlight critical information hazards in academic jailbreak disclosure, as sophisticated attacks exceeding current complexity baselines could disrupt the observed equilibrium and enable widespread harm before defensive adaptation.

Abstract: Recent findings in mechanistic interpretability (MI), the field probing the inner workings of Large Language Models (LLMs), challenge the view that these models rely solely on superficial statistics. Here, we offer an accessible synthesis of these findings that doubles as an introduction to MI, all while integrating these findings within a novel theoretical framework for thinking about machine understanding. We argue that LLMs develop internal structures that are functionally analogous to the kind of understanding that consists in seeing connections. To sharpen this idea, we propose a three-tiered conception of machine understanding. First, conceptual understanding emerges when a model forms "features" as directions in latent space, thereby learning the connections between diverse manifestations of something. Second, state-of-the-world understanding emerges when a model learns contingent factual connections between features and dynamically tracks changes in the world. Third, principled understanding emerges when a model ceases to rely on a collection of memorized facts and discovers a "circuit" that connects these facts. However, we conclude by exploring the "parallel mechanisms" phenomenon, arguing that while LLMs exhibit forms of understanding, their cognitive architecture remains different from ours, and the debate should shift from whether LLMs understand to how their strange minds work.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across domains such as healthcare, education, and cybersecurity. However, this openness also introduces significant security risks, particularly through embedding space poisoning, which is a subtle attack vector where adversaries manipulate the internal semantic representations of input data to bypass safety alignment mechanisms. While previous research has investigated universal perturbation methods, the dynamics of LLM safety alignment at the embedding level remain insufficiently understood. Consequently, more targeted and accurate adversarial perturbation techniques, which pose significant threats, have not been adequately studied.
  In this work, we propose ETTA (Embedding Transformation Toxicity Attenuation), a novel framework that identifies and attenuates toxicity-sensitive dimensions in embedding space via linear transformations. ETTA bypasses model refusal behaviors while preserving linguistic coherence, without requiring model fine-tuning or access to training data. Evaluated on five representative open-source LLMs using the AdvBench benchmark, ETTA achieves a high average attack success rate of 88.61%, outperforming the best baseline by 11.34%, and generalizes to safety-enhanced models (e.g., 77.39% ASR on instruction-tuned defenses). These results highlight a critical vulnerability in current alignment strategies and underscore the need for embedding-aware defenses.

Abstract: The evolution of large models has witnessed the emergence of In-Context Learning (ICL) capabilities. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of ICL. Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have developed Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with ICL capabilities. However, explorations of demonstration configuration for multimodal ICL remain preliminary. Additionally, the controllability of In-Context Examples (ICEs) provides an efficient and cost-effective means to observe and analyze the inference characteristics of LMMs under varying inputs. This paper conducts a comprehensive external and internal investigation of multimodal in-context learning on the image captioning task. Externally, we explore demonstration configuration strategies through three dimensions: shot number, image retrieval, and caption assignment. We employ multiple metrics to systematically and thoroughly evaluate and summarize key findings. Internally, we analyze typical LMM attention characteristics and develop attention-based metrics to quantify model behaviors. We also conduct auxiliary experiments to explore the feasibility of attention-driven model acceleration and compression. We further compare performance variations between LMMs with identical model design and pretraining strategies and explain the differences from the angles of pre-training data features. Our study reveals both how ICEs configuration strategies impact model performance through external experiments and characteristic typical patterns through internal inspection, providing dual perspectives for understanding multimodal ICL in LMMs. Our method of combining external and internal analysis to investigate large models, along with our newly proposed metrics, can be applied to broader research areas.

Abstract: This paper introduces a SSSUMO, semi-supervised deep learning approach for submovement decomposition that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and speed. While submovement analysis offers valuable insights into motor control, existing methods struggle with reconstruction accuracy, computational cost, and validation, due to the difficulty of obtaining hand-labeled data. We address these challenges using a semi-supervised learning framework. This framework learns from synthetic data, initially generated from minimum-jerk principles and then iteratively refined through adaptation to unlabeled human movement data. Our fully convolutional architecture with differentiable reconstruction significantly surpasses existing methods on both synthetic and diverse human motion datasets, demonstrating robustness even in high-noise conditions. Crucially, the model operates in real-time (less than a millisecond per input second), a substantial improvement over optimization-based techniques. This enhanced performance facilitates new applications in human-computer interaction, rehabilitation medicine, and motor control studies. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness across diverse human-performed tasks such as steering, rotation, pointing, object moving, handwriting, and mouse-controlled gaming, showing notable improvements particularly on challenging datasets where traditional methods largely fail. Training and benchmarking source code, along with pre-trained model weights, are made publicly available at https://github.com/dolphin-in-a-coma/sssumo.

Abstract: This paper deals with improving querying large language models (LLMs). It is well-known that without relevant contextual information, LLMs can provide poor quality responses or tend to hallucinate. Several initiatives have proposed integrating LLMs with external tools to provide them with up-to-date data to improve accuracy. In this paper, we propose a framework to integrate external tools to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in answering queries in educational settings. Precisely, we develop a framework that allows accessing external APIs to request additional relevant information. Integrated tools can also provide computational capabilities such as calculators or calendars. The proposed framework has been evaluated using datasets from the Multi-Modal Language Understanding (MMLU) collection. The data consists of questions on mathematical and scientific reasoning. Results compared to state-of-the-art language models show that the proposed approach significantly improves performance. Our Athena framework achieves 83% accuracy in mathematical reasoning and 88% in scientific reasoning, substantially outperforming all tested models including GPT-4o, LLaMA-Large, Mistral-Large, Phi-Large, and GPT-3.5, with the best baseline model (LLaMA-Large) achieving only 67% and 79% respectively. These promising results open the way to creating complex computing ecosystems around LLMs to make their use more natural to support various tasks and activities.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) underscore the need for stronger reasoning capabilities to solve complex problems effectively. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been a step forward, it remains insufficient for many domains. A promising alternative is explicit high-level plan generation, but existing approaches largely assume that LLMs can produce effective plans through few-shot prompting alone, without additional training. In this work, we challenge this assumption and introduce CRISP (Complex Reasoning with Interpretable Step-based Plans), a multi-domain dataset of high-level plans for mathematical reasoning and code generation. The plans in CRISP are automatically generated and rigorously validated--both intrinsically, using an LLM as a judge, and extrinsically, by evaluating their impact on downstream task performance. We demonstrate that fine-tuning a small model on CRISP enables it to generate higher-quality plans than much larger models using few-shot prompting, while significantly outperforming Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Furthermore, our out-of-domain evaluation reveals that fine-tuning on one domain improves plan generation in the other, highlighting the generalizability of learned planning capabilities.

Abstract: Autonomous agents built on language models (LMs) are showing increasing popularity in many fields, including scientific research. AI co-scientists aim to support or automate parts of the research process using these agents. A key component of empirical AI research is the design of ablation experiments. To this end, we introduce AblationBench, a benchmark suite for evaluating agents on ablation planning tasks in empirical AI research. It includes two tasks: AuthorAblation, which helps authors propose ablation experiments based on a method section and contains 83 instances, and ReviewerAblation, which helps reviewers find missing ablations in a full paper and contains 350 instances. For both tasks, we develop LM-based judges that serve as an automatic evaluation framework. Our experiments with frontier LMs show that these tasks remain challenging, with the best-performing LM system identifying only 29% of the original ablations on average. Lastly, we analyze the limitations of current LMs on these tasks, and find that chain-of-thought prompting outperforms the currently existing agent-based approach.

Abstract: The advancements in the domain of LLMs in recent years have surprised many, showcasing their remarkable capabilities and diverse applications. Their potential applications in various real-world scenarios have led to significant research on their reliability and effectiveness. On the other hand, multimodal LLMs and Text-to-Image models have only recently gained prominence, especially when compared to text-only LLMs. Their reliability remains constrained due to insufficient research on assessing their performance and robustness. This paper aims to establish a comprehensive evaluation framework for Text-to-Image models, concentrating particularly on their adherence to prompts. We created a novel dataset that aimed to assess the robustness of these models in generating images that conform to the specified factors of variation in the input text prompts. Our evaluation studies present findings on three variants of Stable Diffusion models: Stable Diffusion 3 Medium, Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, and Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo, and two variants of Janus models: Janus Pro 1B and Janus Pro 7B. We introduce a pipeline that leverages text descriptions generated by the gpt-4o model for our ground-truth images, which are then used to generate artificial images by passing these descriptions to the Text-to-Image models. We then pass these generated images again through gpt-4o using the same system prompt and compare the variation between the two descriptions. Our results reveal that these models struggle to create simple binary images with only two factors of variation: a simple geometric shape and its location. We also show, using pre-trained VAEs on our dataset, that they fail to generate images that follow our input dataset distribution.

Abstract: Foundation models are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and subsequently fine-tuned on small-scale datasets using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques like low-rank adapters (LoRA). In most previous works, LoRA weight matrices are randomly initialized with a fixed rank across all attachment points. In this paper, we improve convergence and final performance of LoRA fine-tuning, using our proposed data-driven weight initialization method, ConsNoTrainLoRA (CNTLoRA). We express LoRA initialization as a domain shift problem where we use multiple constraints relating the pre-training and fine-tuning activations. By reformulating these constraints, we obtain a closed-form estimate of LoRA weights that depends on pre-training weights and fine-tuning activation vectors and hence requires no training during initialization. This weight estimate is decomposed to initialize the up and down matrices with proposed flexibility of variable ranks. With the proposed initialization method, we fine-tune on downstream tasks such as image generation, image classification and image understanding. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that CNTLoRA outperforms standard and data-driven weight initialization methods. Extensive analyses and ablations further elucidate the design choices of our framework, providing an optimal recipe for faster convergence and enhanced performance.

<title>Krul: Efficient State Restoration for Multi-turn Conversations with Dynamic Cross-layer KV Sharing</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.08045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient state restoration in multi-turn conversations with large language models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to the overhead of recomputing or loading full key-value (KV) caches for all historical tokens. To address this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers with highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a fixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer pairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention dynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern similarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable accuracy degradation.
  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and efficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies based on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a recomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key innovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical context for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the conversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to mitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model generation; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles brought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV caches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul achieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x reduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without compromising generation quality.

Abstract: The labor-intensive nature of medical data annotation presents a significant challenge for respiratory disease diagnosis, resulting in a scarcity of high-quality labeled datasets in resource-constrained settings. Moreover, patient privacy concerns complicate the direct sharing of local medical data across institutions, and existing centralized data-driven approaches, which rely on amounts of available data, often compromise data privacy. This study proposes a federated few-shot learning framework with privacy-preserving mechanisms to address the issues of limited labeled data and privacy protection in diagnosing respiratory diseases. In particular, a meta-stochastic gradient descent algorithm is proposed to mitigate the overfitting problem that arises from insufficient data when employing traditional gradient descent methods for neural network training. Furthermore, to ensure data privacy against gradient leakage, differential privacy noise from a standard Gaussian distribution is integrated into the gradients during the training of private models with local data, thereby preventing the reconstruction of medical images. Given the impracticality of centralizing respiratory disease data dispersed across various medical institutions, a weighted average algorithm is employed to aggregate local diagnostic models from different clients, enhancing the adaptability of a model across diverse scenarios. Experimental results show that the proposed method yields compelling results with the implementation of differential privacy, while effectively diagnosing respiratory diseases using data from different structures, categories, and distributions.

Abstract: Tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE) is a versatile hyperparameter optimization (HPO) method supported by popular HPO tools. Since these HPO tools have been developed in line with the trend of deep learning (DL), the problem setups often used in the DL domain have been discussed for TPE such as multi-objective optimization and multi-fidelity optimization. However, the practical applications of HPO are not limited to DL, and black-box combinatorial optimization is actively utilized in some domains, e.g., chemistry and biology. As combinatorial optimization has been an untouched, yet very important, topic in TPE, we propose an efficient combinatorial optimization algorithm for TPE. In this paper, we first generalize the categorical kernel with the numerical kernel in TPE, enabling us to introduce a distance structure to the categorical kernel. Then we discuss modifications for the newly developed kernel to handle a large combinatorial search space. These modifications reduce the time complexity of the kernel calculation with respect to the size of a combinatorial search space. In the experiments using synthetic problems, we verified that our proposed method identifies better solutions with fewer evaluations than the original TPE. Our algorithm is available in Optuna, an open-source framework for HPO.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of building heights using very high resolution (VHR) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is crucial for various urban applications. This paper introduces a Deep Learning (DL)-based methodology for automated building height estimation from single VHR COSMO-SkyMed images: an object-based regression approach based on bounding box detection followed by height estimation. This model was trained and evaluated on a unique multi-continental dataset comprising eight geographically diverse cities across Europe, North and South America, and Asia, employing a cross-validation strategy to explicitly assess out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. The results demonstrate highly promising performance, particularly on European cities where the model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately one building story (2.20 m in Munich), significantly outperforming recent state-of-the-art methods in similar OOD scenarios. Despite the increased variability observed when generalizing to cities in other continents, particularly in Asia with its distinct urban typologies and prevalence of high-rise structures, this study underscores the significant potential of DL for robust cross-city and cross-continental transfer learning in building height estimation from single VHR SAR data.

Abstract: Social media has amplified the reach of financial influencers known as "finfluencers," who share stock recommendations on platforms like YouTube. Understanding their influence requires analyzing multimodal signals like tone, delivery style, and facial expressions, which extend beyond text-based financial analysis. We introduce VideoConviction, a multimodal dataset with 6,000+ expert annotations, produced through 457 hours of human effort, to benchmark multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and text-based large language models (LLMs) in financial discourse. Our results show that while multimodal inputs improve stock ticker extraction (e.g., extracting Apple's ticker AAPL), both MLLMs and LLMs struggle to distinguish investment actions and conviction--the strength of belief conveyed through confident delivery and detailed reasoning--often misclassifying general commentary as definitive recommendations. While high-conviction recommendations perform better than low-conviction ones, they still underperform the popular S\&amp;P 500 index fund. An inverse strategy--betting against finfluencer recommendations--outperforms the S\&amp;P 500 by 6.8\% in annual returns but carries greater risk (Sharpe ratio of 0.41 vs. 0.65). Our benchmark enables a diverse evaluation of multimodal tasks, comparing model performance on both full video and segmented video inputs. This enables deeper advancements in multimodal financial research. Our code, dataset, and evaluation leaderboard are available under the CC BY-NC 4.0 license.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks have shown promise in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by integrating physical constraints into neural network training, but their performance is sensitive to the sampling of points. Based on the impressive performance of quasi Monte-Carlo methods in high dimensional problems, this paper proposes Quasi-Random Physics-Informed Neural Networks (QRPINNs), which use low-discrepancy sequences for sampling instead of random points directly from the domain. Theoretically, QRPINNs have been proven to have a better convergence rate than PINNs. Empirically, experiments demonstrate that QRPINNs significantly outperform PINNs and some representative adaptive sampling methods, especially in high-dimensional PDEs. Furthermore, combining QRPINNs with adaptive sampling can further improve the performance.

Abstract: We present Audio Flamingo 3 (AF3), a fully open state-of-the-art (SOTA) large audio-language model that advances reasoning and understanding across speech, sound, and music. AF3 introduces: (i) AF-Whisper, a unified audio encoder trained using a novel strategy for joint representation learning across all 3 modalities of speech, sound, and music; (ii) flexible, on-demand thinking, allowing the model to do chain-of-thought-type reasoning before answering; (iii) multi-turn, multi-audio chat; (iv) long audio understanding and reasoning (including speech) up to 10 minutes; and (v) voice-to-voice interaction. To enable these capabilities, we propose several large-scale training datasets curated using novel strategies, including AudioSkills-XL, LongAudio-XL, AF-Think, and AF-Chat, and train AF3 with a novel five-stage curriculum-based training strategy. Trained on only open-source audio data, AF3 achieves new SOTA results on over 20+ (long) audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks, surpassing both open-weight and closed-source models trained on much larger datasets.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for reconstructing dynamic human-object interactions from monocular video that overcomes challenges associated with occlusions and temporal inconsistencies. Traditional 3D reconstruction methods typically assume static objects or full visibility of dynamic subjects, leading to degraded performance when these assumptions are violated-particularly in scenarios where mutual occlusions occur. To address this, our framework leverages amodal completion to infer the complete structure of partially obscured regions. Unlike conventional approaches that operate on individual frames, our method integrates temporal context, enforcing coherence across video sequences to incrementally refine and stabilize reconstructions. This template-free strategy adapts to varying conditions without relying on predefined models, significantly enhancing the recovery of intricate details in dynamic scenes. We validate our approach using 3D Gaussian Splatting on challenging monocular videos, demonstrating superior precision in handling occlusions and maintaining temporal stability compared to existing techniques.

<title>Compactor: Calibrated Query-Agnostic KV Cache Compression with Approximate Leverage Scores</title>

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to support very large context windows. Unfortunately the ability to use long contexts in generation is complicated by the large memory requirement of the KV cache, which scales linearly with the context length. This memory footprint is often the dominant resource bottleneck in real-world deployments, limiting throughput and increasing serving cost. One way to address this is by compressing the KV cache, which can be done either with knowledge of the question being asked (query-aware) or without knowledge of the query (query-agnostic). We present Compactor, a parameter-free, query-agnostic KV compression strategy that uses approximate leverage scores to determine token importance. We show that Compactor can achieve the same performance as competing methods while retaining 1/2 the tokens in both synthetic and real-world context tasks, with minimal computational overhead. We further introduce a procedure for context-calibrated compression, which allows one to infer the maximum compression ratio a given context can support. Using context-calibrated compression, we show that Compactor achieves full KV performance on Longbench while reducing the KV memory burden by 63%, on average. To demonstrate the efficacy and generalizability of our approach, we apply Compactor to 27 synthetic and real-world tasks from RULER and Longbench, with models from both the Qwen 2.5 and Llama 3.1 families.

Abstract: Traffic accidents are rare, yet high-impact events that require long-context multimodal reasoning for accurate risk forecasting. In this paper, we introduce ALCo-FM, a unified adaptive long-context foundation model that computes a volatility pre-score to dynamically select context windows for input data and encodes and fuses these multimodal data via shallow cross attention. Following a local GAT layer and a BigBird-style sparse global transformer over H3 hexagonal grids, coupled with Monte Carlo dropout for confidence, the model yields superior, well-calibrated predictions. Trained on data from 15 US cities with a class-weighted loss to counter label imbalance, and fine-tuned with minimal data on held-out cities, ALCo-FM achieves 0.94 accuracy, 0.92 F1, and an ECE of 0.04, outperforming more than 20 state-of-the-art baselines in large-scale urban risk prediction. Code and dataset are available at: https://github.com/PinakiPrasad12/ALCo-FM

Abstract: Red-blood-cell lysis (HC50) is the principal safety barrier for antimicrobial-peptide (AMP) therapeutics, yet existing models only say "toxic" or "non-toxic." AmpLyze closes this gap by predicting the actual HC50 value from sequence alone and explaining the residues that drive toxicity. The model couples residue-level ProtT5/ESM2 embeddings with sequence-level descriptors in dual local and global branches, aligned by a cross-attention module and trained with log-cosh loss for robustness to assay noise. The optimal AmpLyze model reaches a PCC of 0.756 and an MSE of 0.987, outperforming classical regressors and the state-of-the-art. Ablations confirm that both branches are essential, and cross-attention adds a further 1% PCC and 3% MSE improvement. Expected-Gradients attributions reveal known toxicity hotspots and suggest safer substitutions. By turning hemolysis assessment into a quantitative, sequence-based, and interpretable prediction, AmpLyze facilitates AMP design and offers a practical tool for early-stage toxicity screening.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) and agentic systems is enabling autonomous 6G networks with advanced intelligence, including self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-healing. However, the current implementation of individual intelligence tasks necessitates isolated knowledge retrieval pipelines, resulting in redundant data flows and inconsistent interpretations. Inspired by the service model unification effort in Open-RAN (to support interoperability and vendor diversity), we propose KP-A: a unified Network Knowledge Plane specifically designed for Agentic network intelligence. By decoupling network knowledge acquisition and management from intelligence logic, KP-A streamlines development and reduces maintenance complexity for intelligence engineers. By offering an intuitive and consistent knowledge interface, KP-A also enhances interoperability for the network intelligence agents. We demonstrate KP-A in two representative intelligence tasks: live network knowledge Q&amp;A and edge AI service orchestration. All implementation artifacts have been open-sourced to support reproducibility and future standardization efforts.

<title>Rethinking Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection: A Vision for Causality-Driven Cybersecurity</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08177</link>

Abstract: As cyber-physical systems grow increasingly interconnected and spatially distributed, ensuring their resilience against evolving cyberattacks has become a critical priority. Spatio-Temporal Anomaly detection plays an important role in ensuring system security and operational integrity. However, current data-driven approaches, largely driven by black-box deep learning, face challenges in interpretability, adaptability to distribution shifts, and robustness under evolving system dynamics. In this paper, we advocate for a causal learning perspective to advance anomaly detection in spatially distributed infrastructures that grounds detection in structural cause-effect relationships. We identify and formalize three key directions: causal graph profiling, multi-view fusion, and continual causal graph learning, each offering distinct advantages in uncovering dynamic cause-effect structures across time and space. Drawing on real-world insights from systems such as water treatment infrastructures, we illustrate how causal models provide early warning signals and root cause attribution, addressing the limitations of black-box detectors. Looking ahead, we outline the future research agenda centered on multi-modality, generative AI-driven, and scalable adaptive causal frameworks. Our objective is to lay a new research trajectory toward scalable, adaptive, explainable, and spatially grounded anomaly detection systems. We hope to inspire a paradigm shift in cybersecurity research, promoting causality-driven approaches to address evolving threats in interconnected infrastructures.

Abstract: This is the third year of the TREC Deep Learning track. As in previous years, we leverage the MS MARCO datasets that made hundreds of thousands of human annotated training labels available for both passage and document ranking tasks. In addition, this year we refreshed both the document and the passage collections which also led to a nearly four times increase in the document collection size and nearly $16$ times increase in the size of the passage collection. Deep neural ranking models that employ large scale pretraininig continued to outperform traditional retrieval methods this year. We also found that single stage retrieval can achieve good performance on both tasks although they still do not perform at par with multistage retrieval pipelines. Finally, the increase in the collection size and the general data refresh raised some questions about completeness of NIST judgments and the quality of the training labels that were mapped to the new collections from the old ones which we discuss in this report.

Abstract: This paper develops a neural jamming phase diagram that interprets the emergence of consciousness in large language models as a critical phenomenon in high-dimensional disordered systems.By establishing analogies with jamming transitions in granular matter and other complex systems, we identify three fundamental control parameters governing the phase behavior of neural networks: temperature, volume fraction, and stress.The theory provides a unified physical explanation for empirical scaling laws in artificial intelligence, demonstrating how computational cooling, density optimization, and noise reduction collectively drive systems toward a critical jamming surface where generalized intelligence emerges. Remarkably, the same thermodynamic principles that describe conventional jamming transitions appear to underlie the emergence of consciousness in neural networks, evidenced by shared critical signatures including divergent correlation lengths and scaling exponents.Our work explains neural language models' critical scaling through jamming physics, suggesting consciousness is a jamming phase that intrinsically connects knowledge components via long-range correlations.

Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNN) hold immense potential for the future of quantum machine learning (QML). However, QNN security and robustness remain largely unexplored. In this work, we proposed novel Trojan attacks based on the quantum computing properties in a QNN-based binary classifier. Our proposed Quantum Properties Trojans (QuPTs) are based on the unitary property of quantum gates to insert noise and Hadamard gates to enable superposition to develop Trojans and attack QNNs. We showed that the proposed QuPTs are significantly stealthier and heavily impact the quantum circuits' performance, specifically QNNs. The most impactful QuPT caused a deterioration of 23% accuracy of the compromised QNN under the experimental setup. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on the Trojan attack on a fully quantum neural network independent of any hybrid classical-quantum architecture.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxy students in the development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) and in piloting test questions. However, to what extent these proxy students accurately emulate the behavior and characteristics of real students remains an open question. To investigate this, we collected a dataset of 489 items from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), covering mathematics and reading comprehension in grades 4, 8, and 12. We then apply an Item Response Theory (IRT) model to position 11 diverse and state-of-the-art LLMs on the same ability scale as real student populations. Our findings reveal that, without guidance, strong general-purpose models consistently outperform the average student at every grade, while weaker or domain-mismatched models may align incidentally. Using grade-enforcement prompts changes models' performance, but whether they align with the average grade-level student remains highly model- and prompt-specific: no evaluated model-prompt pair fits the bill across subjects and grades, underscoring the need for new training and evaluation strategies. We conclude by providing guidelines for the selection of viable proxies based on our findings.

Abstract: Smart buildings generate vast streams of sensor and control data, but facility managers often lack clear explanations for anomalous energy usage. We propose InsightBuild, a two-stage framework that integrates causality analysis with a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to provide human-readable, causal explanations of energy consumption patterns. First, a lightweight causal inference module applies Granger causality tests and structural causal discovery on building telemetry (e.g., temperature, HVAC settings, occupancy) drawn from Google Smart Buildings and Berkeley Office datasets. Next, an LLM, fine-tuned on aligned pairs of sensor-level causes and textual explanations, receives as input the detected causal relations and generates concise, actionable explanations. We evaluate InsightBuild on two real-world datasets (Google: 2017-2022; Berkeley: 2018-2020), using expert-annotated ground-truth causes for a held-out set of anomalies. Our results demonstrate that combining explicit causal discovery with LLM-based natural language generation yields clear, precise explanations that assist facility managers in diagnosing and mitigating energy inefficiencies.

Abstract: Missing data presents a critical challenge in real-world datasets, significantly degrading the performance of machine learning models. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tabular data imputation, exemplified by frameworks like UnIMP, their reliance on classical embedding methods often limits their ability to capture complex, non-linear correlations, particularly in mixed-type data scenarios encompassing numerical, categorical, and textual features. This paper introduces Quantum-UnIMP, a novel framework that integrates shallow quantum circuits into an LLM-based imputation architecture. Our core innovation lies in replacing conventional classical input embeddings with quantum feature maps generated by an Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial (IQP) circuit. This approach enables the model to leverage quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement, thereby learning richer, more expressive representations of data and enhancing the recovery of intricate missingness patterns. Our experiments on benchmark mixed-type datasets demonstrate that Quantum-UnIMP reduces imputation error by up to 15.2% for numerical features (RMSE) and improves classification accuracy by 8.7% for categorical features (F1-Score) compared to state-of-the-art classical and LLM-based methods. These compelling results underscore the profound potential of quantum-enhanced representations for complex data imputation tasks, even with near-term quantum hardware.

Abstract: Building a robust perception module is crucial for visuomotor policy learning. While recent methods incorporate pre-trained 2D foundation models into robotic perception modules to leverage their strong semantic understanding, they struggle to capture 3D spatial information and generalize across diverse camera viewpoints. These limitations hinder the policy's effectiveness, especially in fine-grained robotic manipulation scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose CL3R, a novel 3D pre-training framework designed to enhance robotic manipulation policies. Our method integrates both spatial awareness and semantic understanding by employing a point cloud Masked Autoencoder to learn rich 3D representations while leveraging pre-trained 2D foundation models through contrastive learning for efficient semantic knowledge transfer. Additionally, we propose a 3D visual representation pre-training framework for robotic tasks. By unifying coordinate systems across datasets and introducing random fusion of multi-view point clouds, we mitigate camera view ambiguity and improve generalization, enabling robust perception from novel viewpoints at test time. Extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world demonstrate the superiority of our method, highlighting its effectiveness in visuomotor policy learning for robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a pivotal challenge in advancing AI capabilities. While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are the dominant training paradigms, a systematic methodology for combining them to maximize both accuracy and efficiency remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a practical and effective training recipe that strategically integrates extended SFT with RL from online inference (GRPO). We posit that these methods play complementary, not competing, roles: a prolonged SFT phase first pushes the model's accuracy to its limits, after which a GRPO phase dramatically improves token efficiency while preserving this peak performance. Our experiments reveal that extending SFT for as many as 10 epochs is crucial for performance breakthroughs, and that the primary role of GRPO in this framework is to optimize solution length. The efficacy of our recipe is rigorously validated through top-tier performance on challenging benchmarks, including a high rank among over 2,200 teams in the strictly leak-free AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO). This work provides the community with a battle-tested blueprint for developing state-of-the-art mathematical reasoners that are both exceptionally accurate and practically efficient. To ensure full reproducibility and empower future research, we will open-source our entire framework, including all code, model checkpoints, and training configurations at https://github.com/analokmaus/kaggle-aimo2-fast-math-r1.

Abstract: We introduce a lightweight yet highly effective safety guardrail framework for language models, demonstrating that small-scale language models can achieve, and even surpass, the performance of larger counterparts in content moderation tasks. This is accomplished through high-fidelity synthetic data generation and adversarial training. The synthetic data generation process begins with human-curated seed data, which undergoes query augmentation and paraphrasing to create diverse and contextually rich examples. This augmented data is then subjected to multiple rounds of curation, ensuring high fidelity and relevance. Inspired by recent advances in the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture, our adversarial training employs reinforcement learning to guide a generator that produces challenging synthetic examples. These examples are used to fine-tune the safety classifier, enhancing its ability to detect and mitigate harmful content. Additionally, we incorporate strategies from recent research on efficient LLM training, leveraging the capabilities of smaller models to improve the performance of larger generative models. With iterative adversarial training and the generation of diverse, high-quality synthetic data, our framework enables small language models (SLMs) to serve as robust safety guardrails. This approach not only reduces computational overhead but also enhances resilience against adversarial attacks, offering a scalable and efficient solution for content moderation in AI systems.

Abstract: Watermarking technology has gained significant attention due to the increasing importance of intellectual property (IP) rights, particularly with the growing deployment of large language models (LLMs) on billions resource-constrained edge devices. To counter the potential threats of IP theft by malicious users, this paper introduces a robust watermarking scheme without retraining or fine-tuning for transformer models. The scheme generates a unique key for each user and derives a stable watermark value by solving linear constraints constructed from model invariants. Moreover, this technology utilizes noise mechanism to hide watermark locations in multi-user scenarios against collusion attack. This paper evaluates the approach on three popular models (Llama3, Phi3, Gemma), and the experimental results confirm the strong robustness across a range of attack methods (fine-tuning, pruning, quantization, permutation, scaling, reversible matrix and collusion attacks).

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in document image tasks, especially Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However, they struggle with Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT), which requires handling both cross-modal and cross-lingual challenges. Previous efforts to enhance DIMT capability through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on the DIMT dataset often result in the forgetting of the model's existing monolingual abilities, such as OCR. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel fine-tuning paradigm, named Synchronously Self-Reviewing (SSR) its OCR proficiency, inspired by the concept "Bilingual Cognitive Advantage". Specifically, SSR prompts the model to generate OCR text before producing translation text, which allows the model to leverage its strong monolingual OCR ability while learning to translate text across languages. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the proposed SSR learning helps mitigate catastrophic forgetting, improving the generalization ability of MLLMs on both OCR and DIMT tasks.

Abstract: Deep learning has driven significant advances in medical image analysis, yet its adoption in clinical practice remains constrained by the large size and lack of transparency in modern models. Advances in interpretability techniques such as DL-Backtrace, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, and Integrated Gradients make it possible to assess the contribution of individual components within neural networks trained on medical imaging tasks. In this work, we introduce an interpretability-guided pruning framework that reduces model complexity while preserving both predictive performance and transparency. By selectively retaining only the most relevant parts of each layer, our method enables targeted compression that maintains clinically meaningful representations. Experiments across multiple medical image classification benchmarks demonstrate that this approach achieves high compression rates with minimal loss in accuracy, paving the way for lightweight, interpretable models suited for real-world deployment in healthcare settings.

Abstract: Audio inpainting refers to the task of reconstructing missing segments in corrupted audio recordings. While prior approaches-including waveform and spectrogram-based diffusion models-have shown promising results for short gaps, they often degrade in quality when gaps exceed 100 milliseconds (ms). In this work, we introduce a novel inpainting method based on discrete diffusion modeling, which operates over tokenized audio representations produced by a pre-trained audio tokenizer. Our approach models the generative process directly in the discrete latent space, enabling stable and semantically coherent reconstruction of missing audio. We evaluate the method on the MusicNet dataset using both objective and perceptual metrics across gap durations up to 300 ms. We further evaluated our approach on the MTG dataset, extending the gap duration to 500 ms. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing baselines, particularly for longer gaps, offering a robust solution for restoring degraded musical recordings. Audio examples of our proposed method can be found at https://iftach21.github.io/

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide interpretable and controllable generative modeling by routing generation through explicit, human-understandable concepts. However, previous generative CBMs often rely on auxiliary visual cues at the bottleneck to compensate for information not captured by the concepts, which undermines interpretability and compositionality. We propose CoCo-Bot, a post-hoc, composable concept bottleneck generative model that eliminates the need for auxiliary cues by transmitting all information solely through explicit concepts. Guided by diffusion-based energy functions, CoCo-Bot supports robust post-hoc interventions-such as concept composition and negation-across arbitrary concepts. Experiments using StyleGAN2 pre-trained on CelebA-HQ show that CoCo-Bot improves concept-level controllability and interpretability, while maintaining competitive visual quality.

Abstract: Deep learning has shown remarkable performance in integrating multimodal data for survival prediction. However, existing multimodal methods mainly focus on single cancer types and overlook the challenge of generalization across cancers. In this work, we are the first to reveal that multimodal prognosis models often generalize worse than unimodal ones in cross-cancer scenarios, despite the critical need for such robustness in clinical practice. To address this, we propose a new task: Cross-Cancer Single Domain Generalization for Multimodal Prognosis, which evaluates whether models trained on a single cancer type can generalize to unseen cancers. We identify two key challenges: degraded features from weaker modalities and ineffective multimodal integration. To tackle these, we introduce two plug-and-play modules: Sparse Dirac Information Rebalancer (SDIR) and Cancer-aware Distribution Entanglement (CADE). SDIR mitigates the dominance of strong features by applying Bernoulli-based sparsification and Dirac-inspired stabilization to enhance weaker modality signals. CADE, designed to synthesize the target domain distribution, fuses local morphological cues and global gene expression in latent space. Experiments on a four-cancer-type benchmark demonstrate superior generalization, laying the foundation for practical, robust cross-cancer multimodal prognosis.

Abstract: Reliable satellite attitude control is essential for the success of space missions, particularly as satellites increasingly operate autonomously in dynamic and uncertain environments. Reaction wheels (RWs) play a pivotal role in attitude control, and maintaining control resilience during RW faults is critical to preserving mission objectives and system stability. However, traditional Proportional Derivative (PD) controllers and existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms such as TD3, PPO, and A2C often fall short in providing the real time adaptability and fault tolerance required for autonomous satellite operations. This study introduces a DRL-based control strategy designed to improve satellite resilience and adaptability under fault conditions. Specifically, the proposed method integrates Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) with Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) and Dimension Wise Clipping (DWC) referred to as TD3-HD to enhance learning in sparse reward environments and maintain satellite stability during RW failures. The proposed approach is benchmarked against PD control and leading DRL algorithms. Experimental results show that TD3-HD achieves significantly lower attitude error, improved angular velocity regulation, and enhanced stability under fault conditions. These findings underscore the proposed method potential as a powerful, fault tolerant, onboard AI solution for autonomous satellite attitude control.

<title>PanMatch: Unleashing the Potential of Large Vision Models for Unified Matching Models</title>

Abstract: This work presents PanMatch, a versatile foundation model for robust correspondence matching. Unlike previous methods that rely on task-specific architectures and domain-specific fine-tuning to support tasks like stereo matching, optical flow or feature matching, our key insight is that any two-frame correspondence matching task can be addressed within a 2D displacement estimation framework using the same model weights. Such a formulation eliminates the need for designing specialized unified architectures or task-specific ensemble models. Instead, it achieves multi-task integration by endowing displacement estimation algorithms with unprecedented generalization capabilities. To this end, we highlight the importance of a robust feature extractor applicable across multiple domains and tasks, and propose the feature transformation pipeline that leverage all-purpose features from Large Vision Models to endow matching baselines with zero-shot cross-view matching capabilities. Furthermore, we assemble a cross-domain dataset with near 1.8 million samples from stereo matching, optical flow, and feature matching domains to pretrain PanMatch. We demonstrate the versatility of PanMatch across a wide range of domains and downstream tasks using the same model weights. Our model outperforms UniMatch and Flow-Anything on cross-task evaluations, and achieves comparable performance to most state-of-the-art task-specific algorithms on task-oriented benchmarks. Additionally, PanMatch presents unprecedented zero-shot performance in abnormal scenarios, such as rainy day and satellite imagery, where most existing robust algorithms fail to yield meaningful results.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) has become the most certain and prominent feature of 6G mobile networks. Unlike 5G, where AI/ML was not natively integrated but rather an add-on feature over existing architecture, 6G shall incorporate AI from the onset to address its complexity and support ubiquitous AI applications. Based on our extensive mobile network operation and standardization experience from 2G to 5G, this paper explores the design and standardization principles of AI-Native radio access networks (RAN) for 6G, with a particular focus on its critical Day 1 architecture, functionalities and capabilities. We investigate the framework of AI-Native RAN and present its three essential capabilities to shed some light on the standardization direction; namely, AI-driven RAN processing/optimization/automation, reliable AI lifecycle management (LCM), and AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) provisioning. The standardization of AI-Native RAN, in particular the Day 1 features, including an AI-Native 6G RAN architecture, were proposed. For validation, a large-scale field trial with over 5000 5G-A base stations have been built and delivered significant improvements in average air interface latency, root cause identification, and network energy consumption with the proposed architecture and the supporting AI functions. This paper aims to provide a Day 1 framework for 6G AI-Native RAN standardization design, balancing technical innovation with practical deployment.

<title>Deep Hashing with Semantic Hash Centers for Image Retrieval</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08404</link>

Abstract: Deep hashing is an effective approach for large-scale image retrieval. Current methods are typically classified by their supervision types: point-wise, pair-wise, and list-wise. Recent point-wise techniques (e.g., CSQ, MDS) have improved retrieval performance by pre-assigning a hash center to each class, enhancing the discriminability of hash codes across various datasets. However, these methods rely on data-independent algorithms to generate hash centers, which neglect the semantic relationships between classes and may degrade retrieval performance.
  This paper introduces the concept of semantic hash centers, building on the idea of traditional hash centers. We hypothesize that hash centers of semantically related classes should have closer Hamming distances, while those of unrelated classes should be more distant. To this end, we propose a three-stage framework, SHC, to generate hash codes that preserve semantic structure.
  First, we develop a classification network to identify semantic similarities between classes using a data-dependent similarity calculation that adapts to varying data distributions. Second, we introduce an optimization algorithm to generate semantic hash centers, preserving semantic relatedness while enforcing a minimum distance between centers to avoid excessively similar hash codes. Finally, a deep hashing network is trained using these semantic centers to convert images into binary hash codes.
  Experimental results on large-scale retrieval tasks across several public datasets show that SHC significantly improves retrieval performance. Specifically, SHC achieves average improvements of +7.26%, +7.62%, and +11.71% in MAP@100, MAP@1000, and MAP@ALL metrics, respectively, over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Current knowledge editing methods for large language models (LLMs) struggle to maintain logical consistency when propagating ripple effects to associated facts. We propose ChainEdit, a framework that synergizes knowledge graph-derived logical rules with LLM logical reasoning capabilities to enable systematic chain updates. By automatically extracting logical patterns from structured knowledge bases and aligning them with LLMs' internal logics, ChainEdit dynamically generates and edits logically connected knowledge clusters. Experiments demonstrate an improvement of more than 30% in logical generalization over baselines while preserving editing reliability and specificity. We further address evaluation biases in existing benchmarks through knowledge-aware protocols that disentangle external dependencies. This work establishes new state-of-the-art performance on ripple effect while ensuring internal logical consistency after knowledge editing.

<title>Finding Common Ground: Using Large Language Models to Detect Agreement in Multi-Agent Decision Conferences</title>

Abstract: Decision conferences are structured, collaborative meetings that bring together experts from various fields to address complex issues and reach a consensus on recommendations for future actions or policies. These conferences often rely on facilitated discussions to ensure productive dialogue and collective agreement. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in simulating real-world scenarios, particularly through collaborative multi-agent systems that mimic group interactions. In this work, we present a novel LLM-based multi-agent system designed to simulate decision conferences, specifically focusing on detecting agreement among the participant agents. To achieve this, we evaluate six distinct LLMs on two tasks: stance detection, which identifies the position an agent takes on a given issue, and stance polarity detection, which identifies the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. These models are further assessed within the multi-agent system to determine their effectiveness in complex simulations. Our results indicate that LLMs can reliably detect agreement even in dynamic and nuanced debates. Incorporating an agreement-detection agent within the system can also improve the efficiency of group debates and enhance the overall quality and coherence of deliberations, making them comparable to real-world decision conferences regarding outcome and decision-making. These findings demonstrate the potential for LLM-based multi-agent systems to simulate group decision-making processes. They also highlight that such systems could be instrumental in supporting decision-making with expert elicitation workshops across various domains.

<title>Vision Foundation Models as Effective Visual Tokenizers for Autoregressive Image Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08441</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.08441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leveraging the powerful representations of pre-trained vision foundation models -- traditionally used for visual comprehension -- we explore a novel direction: building an image tokenizer directly atop such models, a largely underexplored area. Specifically, we employ a frozen vision foundation model as the encoder of our tokenizer. To enhance its effectiveness, we introduce two key components: (1) a region-adaptive quantization framework that reduces redundancy in the pre-trained features on regular 2D grids, and (2) a semantic reconstruction objective that aligns the tokenizer's outputs with the foundation model's representations to preserve semantic fidelity. Based on these designs, our proposed image tokenizer, VFMTok, achieves substantial improvements in image reconstruction and generation quality, while also enhancing token efficiency. It further boosts autoregressive (AR) generation -- achieving a gFID of 2.07 on ImageNet benchmarks, while accelerating model convergence by three times, and enabling high-fidelity class-conditional synthesis without the need for classifier-free guidance (CFG). The code will be released publicly to benefit the community.

<title>CUE-RAG: Towards Accurate and Cost-Efficient Graph-Based RAG via Multi-Partite Graph and Query-Driven Iterative Retrieval</title>

arXiv:2507.08445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), their performance in question answering (QA) remains limited by the lack of domain-specific and up-to-date knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by incorporating external information, often from graph-structured data. However, existing graph-based RAG methods suffer from poor graph quality due to incomplete extraction and insufficient utilization of query information during retrieval. To overcome these limitations, we propose CUE-RAG, a novel approach that introduces (1) a multi-partite graph index incorporates text Chunks, knowledge Units, and Entities to capture semantic content at multiple levels of granularity, (2) a hybrid extraction strategy that reduces LLM token usage while still producing accurate and disambiguated knowledge units, and (3) Q-Iter, a query-driven iterative retrieval strategy that enhances relevance through semantic search and constrained graph traversal. Experiments on three QA benchmarks show that CUE-RAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 99.33% higher Accuracy and 113.51% higher F1 score while reducing indexing costs by 72.58%. Remarkably, CUE-RAG matches or outperforms baselines even without using an LLM for indexing. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of CUE-RAG in advancing graph-based RAG systems.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction, which aims to recover the dense three-dimensional structure of a scene, is a cornerstone technology for numerous applications, including augmented/virtual reality, autonomous driving, and robotics. While traditional pipelines like Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) achieve high precision through iterative optimization, they are limited by complex workflows, high computational cost, and poor robustness in challenging scenarios like texture-less regions. Recently, deep learning has catalyzed a paradigm shift in 3D reconstruction. A new family of models, exemplified by DUSt3R, has pioneered a feed-forward approach. These models employ a unified deep network to jointly infer camera poses and dense geometry directly from an Unconstrained set of images in a single forward pass. This survey provides a systematic review of this emerging domain. We begin by dissecting the technical framework of these feed-forward models, including their Transformer-based correspondence modeling, joint pose and geometry regression mechanisms, and strategies for scaling from two-view to multi-view scenarios. To highlight the disruptive nature of this new paradigm, we contrast it with both traditional pipelines and earlier learning-based methods like MVSNet. Furthermore, we provide an overview of relevant datasets and evaluation metrics. Finally, we discuss the technology's broad application prospects and identify key future challenges and opportunities, such as model accuracy and scalability, and handling dynamic scenes.

<title>A document is worth a structured record: Principled inductive bias design for document recognition</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.08458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many document types use intrinsic, convention-driven structures that serve to encode precise and structured information, such as the conventions governing engineering drawings. However, state-of-the-art approaches treat document recognition as a mere computer vision problem, neglecting these underlying document-type-specific structural properties, making them dependent on sub-optimal heuristic post-processing and rendering many less frequent or more complicated document types inaccessible to modern document recognition. We suggest a novel perspective that frames document recognition as a transcription task from a document to a record. This implies a natural grouping of documents based on the intrinsic structure inherent in their transcription, where related document types can be treated (and learned) similarly. We propose a method to design structure-specific inductive biases for the underlying machine-learned end-to-end document recognition systems, and a respective base transformer architecture that we successfully adapt to different structures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the so-found inductive biases in extensive experiments with progressively complex record structures from monophonic sheet music, shape drawings, and simplified engineering drawings. By integrating an inductive bias for unrestricted graph structures, we train the first-ever successful end-to-end model to transcribe engineering drawings to their inherently interlinked information. Our approach is relevant to inform the design of document recognition systems for document types that are less well understood than standard OCR, OMR, etc., and serves as a guide to unify the design of future document foundation models.

Abstract: Optimizers play a decisive role in reducing pre-training times for LLMs and achieving better-performing models. In this study, we compare three major variants: the de-facto standard AdamW, the simpler Lion, developed through an evolutionary search, and the second-order optimizer Sophia. For better generalization, we train with two different base architectures and use a single- and a multiple-epoch approach while keeping the number of tokens constant. Using the Maximal Update Parametrization and smaller proxy models, we tune relevant hyperparameters separately for each combination of base architecture and optimizer. We found that while the results from all three optimizers were in approximately the same range, Sophia exhibited the lowest training and validation loss, Lion was fastest in terms of training GPU hours but AdamW led to the best downstream evaluation results.

Abstract: Essays are considered a valuable mechanism for evaluating learning outcomes in writing. Textual cohesion is an essential characteristic of a text, as it facilitates the establishment of meaning between its parts. Automatically scoring cohesion in essays presents a challenge in the field of educational artificial intelligence. The machine learning algorithms used to evaluate texts generally do not consider the individual characteristics of the instances that comprise the analysed corpus. In this meaning, item response theory can be adapted to the context of machine learning, characterising the ability, difficulty and discrimination of the models used. This work proposes and analyses the performance of a cohesion score prediction approach based on item response theory to adjust the scores generated by machine learning models. In this study, the corpus selected for the experiments consisted of the extended Essay-BR, which includes 6,563 essays in the style of the National High School Exam (ENEM), and the Brazilian Portuguese Narrative Essays, comprising 1,235 essays written by 5th to 9th grade students from public schools. We extracted 325 linguistic features and treated the problem as a machine learning regression task. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms conventional machine learning models and ensemble methods in several evaluation metrics. This research explores a potential approach for improving the automatic evaluation of cohesion in educational essays.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for SemEval 2025 Task 11: Bridging the Gap in Text-Based Emotion Detection (Track A), which focuses on multi-label emotion detection in short texts. We propose a feature-centric framework that dynamically adapts document representations and learning algorithms to optimize language-specific performance. Our study evaluates three key components: document representation, dimensionality reduction, and model training in 28 languages, highlighting five for detailed analysis. The results show that TF-IDF remains highly effective for low-resource languages, while contextual embeddings like FastText and transformer-based document representations, such as those produced by Sentence-BERT, exhibit language-specific strengths. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces training time without compromising performance, particularly benefiting FastText and neural models such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). Computational efficiency analysis underscores the trade-off between model complexity and processing cost. Our framework provides a scalable solution for multilingual emotion detection, addressing the challenges of linguistic diversity and resource constraints.

Abstract: Generating expressive audio performances from music scores requires models to capture both instrument acoustics and human interpretation. Traditional music performance synthesis pipelines follow a two-stage approach, first generating expressive performance MIDI from a score, then synthesising the MIDI into audio. However, the synthesis models often struggle to generalise across diverse MIDI sources, musical styles, and recording environments. To address these challenges, we propose MIDI-VALLE, a neural codec language model adapted from the VALLE framework, which was originally designed for zero-shot personalised text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. For performance MIDI-to-audio synthesis, we improve the architecture to condition on a reference audio performance and its corresponding MIDI. Unlike previous TTS-based systems that rely on piano rolls, MIDI-VALLE encodes both MIDI and audio as discrete tokens, facilitating a more consistent and robust modelling of piano performances. Furthermore, the model's generalisation ability is enhanced by training on an extensive and diverse piano performance dataset. Evaluation results show that MIDI-VALLE significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline, achieving over 75% lower Frechet Audio Distance on the ATEPP and Maestro datasets. In the listening test, MIDI-VALLE received 202 votes compared to 58 for the baseline, demonstrating improved synthesis quality and generalisation across diverse performance MIDI inputs.

Abstract: The proliferation of software vulnerabilities presents a significant challenge to cybersecurity, necessitating more effective detection methodologies. We introduce White-Basilisk, a novel approach to vulnerability detection that demonstrates superior performance while challenging prevailing assumptions in AI model scaling. Utilizing an innovative architecture that integrates Mamba layers, linear self-attention, and a Mixture of Experts framework, White-Basilisk achieves state-of-the-art results in vulnerability detection tasks with a parameter count of only 200M. The model's capacity to process sequences of unprecedented length enables comprehensive analysis of extensive codebases in a single pass, surpassing the context limitations of current Large Language Models (LLMs). White-Basilisk exhibits robust performance on imbalanced, real-world datasets, while maintaining computational efficiency that facilitates deployment across diverse organizational scales. This research not only establishes new benchmarks in code security but also provides empirical evidence that compact, efficiently designed models can outperform larger counterparts in specialized tasks, potentially redefining optimization strategies in AI development for domain-specific applications.

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is a valuable field for supporting clinical decision-making, yet current methods primarily support 2D images and require fully annotated queries, limiting clinical flexibility. To address this, we propose RadiomicsRetrieval, a 3D content-based retrieval framework bridging handcrafted radiomics descriptors with deep learning-based embeddings at the tumor level. Unlike existing 2D approaches, RadiomicsRetrieval fully exploits volumetric data to leverage richer spatial context in medical images. We employ a promptable segmentation model (e.g., SAM) to derive tumor-specific image embeddings, which are aligned with radiomics features extracted from the same tumor via contrastive learning. These representations are further enriched by anatomical positional embedding (APE). As a result, RadiomicsRetrieval enables flexible querying based on shape, location, or partial feature sets. Extensive experiments on both lung CT and brain MRI public datasets demonstrate that radiomics features significantly enhance retrieval specificity, while APE provides global anatomical context essential for location-based searches. Notably, our framework requires only minimal user prompts (e.g., a single point), minimizing segmentation overhead and supporting diverse clinical scenarios. The capability to query using either image embeddings or selected radiomics attributes highlights its adaptability, potentially benefiting diagnosis, treatment planning, and research on large-scale medical imaging repositories. Our code is available at https://github.com/nainye/RadiomicsRetrieval.

Abstract: Text-to-audio (T2A) generation has achieved promising results with the recent advances in generative models. However, because of the limited quality and quantity of temporally-aligned audio-text pairs, existing T2A methods struggle to handle the complex text prompts that contain precise timing control, e.g., "owl hooted at 2.4s-5.2s". Recent works have explored data augmentation techniques or introduced timing conditions as model inputs to enable timing-conditioned 10-second T2A generation, while their synthesis quality is still limited. In this work, we propose a novel training-free timing-controlled T2A framework, FreeAudio, making the first attempt to enable timing-controlled long-form T2A generation, e.g., "owl hooted at 2.4s-5.2s and crickets chirping at 0s-24s". Specifically, we first employ an LLM to plan non-overlapping time windows and recaption each with a refined natural language description, based on the input text and timing prompts. Then we introduce: 1) Decoupling and Aggregating Attention Control for precise timing control; 2) Contextual Latent Composition for local smoothness and Reference Guidance for global consistency. Extensive experiments show that: 1) FreeAudio achieves state-of-the-art timing-conditioned T2A synthesis quality among training-free methods and is comparable to leading training-based methods; 2) FreeAudio demonstrates comparable long-form generation quality with training-based Stable Audio and paves the way for timing-controlled long-form T2A synthesis.

Abstract: This study aims to develop a novel multi-modal fusion framework for brain tumor segmentation that integrates spatial-language-vision information through bidirectional interactive attention mechanisms to improve segmentation accuracy and boundary delineation. Methods: We propose two core components: Multi-modal Semantic Fusion Adapter (MSFA) integrating 3D MRI data with clinical text descriptions through hierarchical semantic decoupling, and Bidirectional Interactive Visual-semantic Attention (BIVA) enabling iterative information exchange between modalities. The framework was evaluated on BraTS 2020 dataset comprising 369 multi-institutional MRI scans. Results: The proposed method achieved average Dice coefficient of 0.8505 and 95% Hausdorff distance of 2.8256mm across enhancing tumor, tumor core, and whole tumor regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods including SCAU-Net, CA-Net, and 3D U-Net. Ablation studies confirmed critical contributions of semantic and spatial modules to boundary precision. Conclusion: Multi-modal semantic fusion combined with bidirectional interactive attention significantly enhances brain tumor segmentation performance, establishing new paradigms for integrating clinical knowledge into medical image analysis.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in agentic frameworks, in which prompts trigger complex tool-based analysis in pursuit of a goal. While these frameworks have shown promise across multiple domains including in finance, they typically lack a principled model-building step, relying instead on sentiment- or trend-based analysis. We address this gap by developing an agentic system that uses LLMs to iteratively discover stochastic differential equations for financial time series. These models generate risk metrics which inform daily trading decisions. We evaluate our system in both traditional backtests and using a market simulator, which introduces synthetic but causally plausible price paths and news events. We find that model-informed trading strategies outperform standard LLM-based agents, improving Sharpe ratios across multiple equities. Our results show that combining LLMs with agentic model discovery enhances market risk estimation and enables more profitable trading decisions.

Abstract: Proto-personas are commonly used during early-stage Product Discovery, such as Lean Inception, to guide product definition and stakeholder alignment. However, the manual creation of proto-personas is often time-consuming, cognitively demanding, and prone to bias. In this paper, we propose and empirically investigate a prompt engineering-based approach to generate proto-personas with the support of Generative AI (GenAI). Our goal is to evaluate the approach in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, user acceptance, and the empathy elicited by the generated personas. We conducted a case study with 19 participants embedded in a real Lean Inception, employing a qualitative and quantitative methods design. The results reveal the approach's efficiency by reducing time and effort and improving the quality and reusability of personas in later discovery phases, such as Minimum Viable Product (MVP) scoping and feature refinement. While acceptance was generally high, especially regarding perceived usefulness and ease of use, participants noted limitations related to generalization and domain specificity. Furthermore, although cognitive empathy was strongly supported, affective and behavioral empathy varied significantly across participants. These results contribute novel empirical evidence on how GenAI can be effectively integrated into software Product Discovery practices, while also identifying key challenges to be addressed in future iterations of such hybrid design processes.

<title>Towards Collaborative Fairness in Federated Learning Under Imbalanced Covariate Shift</title>

Abstract: Collaborative fairness is a crucial challenge in federated learning. However, existing approaches often overlook a practical yet complex form of heterogeneity: imbalanced covariate shift. We provide a theoretical analysis of this setting, which motivates the design of FedAKD (Federated Asynchronous Knowledge Distillation)- simple yet effective approach that balances accurate prediction with collaborative fairness. FedAKD consists of client and server updates. In the client update, we introduce a novel asynchronous knowledge distillation strategy based on our preliminary analysis, which reveals that while correctly predicted samples exhibit similar feature distributions across clients, incorrectly predicted samples show significant variability. This suggests that imbalanced covariate shift primarily arises from misclassified samples. Leveraging this insight, our approach first applies traditional knowledge distillation to update client models while keeping the global model fixed. Next, we select correctly predicted high-confidence samples and update the global model using these samples while keeping client models fixed. The server update simply aggregates all client models. We further provide a theoretical proof of FedAKD's convergence. Experimental results on public datasets (FashionMNIST and CIFAR10) and a real-world Electronic Health Records (EHR) dataset demonstrate that FedAKD significantly improves collaborative fairness, enhances predictive accuracy, and fosters client participation even under highly heterogeneous data distributions.

<title>A comprehensive study of LLM-based argument classification: from LLAMA through GPT-4o to Deepseek-R1</title>

Abstract: Argument mining (AM) is an interdisciplinary research field that integrates insights from logic, philosophy, linguistics, rhetoric, law, psychology, and computer science. It involves the automatic identification and extraction of argumentative components, such as premises and claims, and the detection of relationships between them, such as support, attack, or neutrality. Recently, the field has advanced significantly, especially with the advent of large language models (LLMs), which have enhanced the efficiency of analyzing and extracting argument semantics compared to traditional methods and other deep learning models. There are many benchmarks for testing and verifying the quality of LLM, but there is still a lack of research and results on the operation of these models in publicly available argument classification databases. This paper presents a study of a selection of LLM's, using diverse datasets such as Args.me and UKP. The models tested include versions of GPT, Llama, and DeepSeek, along with reasoning-enhanced variants incorporating the Chain-of-Thoughts algorithm. The results indicate that ChatGPT-4o outperforms the others in the argument classification benchmarks. In case of models incorporated with reasoning capabilities, the Deepseek-R1 shows its superiority. However, despite their superiority, GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 still make errors. The most common errors are discussed for all models. To our knowledge, the presented work is the first broader analysis of the mentioned datasets using LLM and prompt algorithms. The work also shows some weaknesses of known prompt algorithms in argument analysis, while indicating directions for their improvement. The added value of the work is the in-depth analysis of the available argument datasets and the demonstration of their shortcomings.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Ambient Intelligence Rehabilitation Support (AIRS) framework, an advanced artificial intelligence-based solution tailored for home rehabilitation environments. AIRS integrates cutting-edge technologies, including Real-Time 3D Reconstruction (RT-3DR), intelligent navigation, and large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), to create a comprehensive system for machine-guided physical rehabilitation. The general AIRS framework is demonstrated in rehabilitation scenarios following total knee replacement (TKR), utilizing a database of 263 video recordings for evaluation. A smartphone is employed within AIRS to perform RT-3DR of living spaces and has a body-matched avatar to provide visual feedback about the excercise. This avatar is necessary in (a) optimizing exercise configurations, including camera placement, patient positioning, and initial poses, and (b) addressing privacy concerns and promoting compliance with the AI Act. The system guides users through the recording process to ensure the collection of properly recorded videos. AIRS employs two feedback mechanisms: (i) visual 3D feedback, enabling direct comparisons between prerecorded clinical exercises and patient home recordings and (ii) VLM-generated feedback, providing detailed explanations and corrections for exercise errors. The framework also supports people with visual and hearing impairments. It also features a modular design that can be adapted to broader rehabilitation contexts. AIRS software components are available for further use and customization.

Abstract: This study evaluates the recently proposed Document Attention Network (DAN) for extracting key-value information from Uruguayan birth certificates, handwritten in Spanish. We investigate two annotation strategies for automatically transcribing handwritten documents, fine-tuning DAN with minimal training data and annotation effort. Experiments were conducted on two datasets containing the same images (201 scans of birth certificates written by more than 15 different writers) but with different annotation methods. Our findings indicate that normalized annotation is more effective for fields that can be standardized, such as dates and places of birth, whereas diplomatic annotation performs much better for fields containing names and surnames, which can not be standardized.

<title>Scaling Attention to Very Long Sequences in Linear Time with Wavelet-Enhanced Random Spectral Attention (WERSA)</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08637</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Transformer models are computationally costly on long sequences since regular attention has quadratic $O(n^2)$ time complexity. We introduce Wavelet-Enhanced Random Spectral Attention (WERSA), a novel mechanism of linear $O(n)$ time complexity that is pivotal to enable successful long-sequence processing without the performance trade-off. WERSA merges content-adaptive random spectral features together with multi-resolution Haar wavelets and learnable parameters to selectively attend to informative scales of data while preserving linear efficiency.
  Large-scale comparisons \textbf{on single GPU} and across various benchmarks (vision, NLP, hierarchical reasoning) and various attention mechanisms (like Multiheaded Attention, Flash-Attention-2, FNet, Linformer, Performer, Waveformer), reveal uniform advantages of WERSA. It achieves best accuracy in all tests. On ArXiv classification, WERSA improves accuracy over vanilla attention by 1.2\% (86.2\% vs 85.0\%) while cutting training time by 81\% (296s vs 1554s) and FLOPS by 73.4\% (26.2G vs 98.4G). Significantly, WERSA excels where vanilla and FlashAttention-2 fail: on ArXiv-128k's extremely lengthy sequences, it achieves best accuracy (79.1\%) and AUC (0.979) among viable methods, operating on data that gives Out-Of-Memory errors to quadratic methods while being \textbf{twice as fast} as Waveformer, its next-best competitor.
  By significantly reducing computational loads without compromising accuracy, WERSA makes possible more practical, more affordable, long-context models, in particular on low-resource hardware, for more sustainable and more scalable AI development.

Abstract: Common knowledge indicates that the process of constructing image datasets usually depends on the time-intensive and inefficient method of manual collection and annotation. Large models offer a solution via data generation. Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases, multiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various vision models for image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.

Abstract: In Wireless Networked Control Systems (WNCSs), control and communication systems must be co-designed due to their strong interdependence. This paper presents a novel optimization theory-based safe deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for ultra-reliable WNCSs, ensuring constraint satisfaction while optimizing performance, for the first time in the literature. The approach minimizes power consumption under key constraints, including Peak Age of Information (PAoI) violation probability, transmit power, and schedulability in the finite blocklength regime. PAoI violation probability is uniquely derived by combining stochastic maximum allowable transfer interval (MATI) and maximum allowable packet delay (MAD) constraints in a multi-sensor network. The framework consists of two stages: optimization theory and safe DRL. The first stage derives optimality conditions to establish mathematical relationships among variables, simplifying and decomposing the problem. The second stage employs a safe DRL model where a teacher-student framework guides the DRL agent (student). The control mechanism (teacher) evaluates compliance with system constraints and suggests the nearest feasible action when needed. Extensive simulations show that the proposed framework outperforms rule-based and other optimization theory based DRL benchmarks, achieving faster convergence, higher rewards, and greater stability.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) show promising progress in formalizing informal mathematics into machine-verifiable theorems. However, these methods still face bottlenecks due to the limited quantity and quality of multilingual parallel corpora. In this paper, we propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework KELPS (Knowledge-Equation based Logical Processing System) to address these problems. KELPS is an iterative framework for translating, synthesizing, and filtering informal data into multiple formal languages (Lean, Coq, and Isabelle). First, we translate natural language into Knowledge Equations (KEs), a novel language that we designed, theoretically grounded in assertional logic. Next, we convert them to target languages through rigorously defined rules that preserve both syntactic structure and semantic meaning. This process yielded a parallel corpus of over 60,000 problems. Our framework achieves 88.9% syntactic accuracy (pass@1) on MiniF2F, outperforming SOTA models such as Deepseek-V3 (81%) and Herald (81.3%) across multiple datasets. All datasets and codes are available in the supplementary materials.

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning transferable representations without the reliance on large labeled datasets. Its ability to capture intrinsic similarities and differences among data samples has led to state-of-the-art results in computer vision tasks. These strengths make CL particularly well-suited for Earth System Observation (ESO), where diverse satellite modalities such as optical and SAR imagery offer naturally aligned views of the same geospatial regions. However, ESO presents unique challenges, including high inter-class similarity, scene clutter, and ambiguous boundaries, which complicate representation learning -- especially in low-label, multi-label settings. Existing CL frameworks often focus on intra-modality self-supervision or lack mechanisms for multi-label alignment and semantic precision across modalities. In this work, we introduce MoSAiC, a unified framework that jointly optimizes intra- and inter-modality contrastive learning with a multi-label supervised contrastive loss. Designed specifically for multi-modal satellite imagery, MoSAiC enables finer semantic disentanglement and more robust representation learning across spectrally similar and spatially complex classes. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, BigEarthNet V2.0 and Sent12MS, show that MoSAiC consistently outperforms both fully supervised and self-supervised baselines in terms of accuracy, cluster coherence, and generalization in low-label and high-class-overlap scenarios.

Abstract: There is an imperative need to provide quality of life to a growing population of older adults living independently. Personalised solutions that focus on the person and take into consideration their preferences and context are key. In this work, we introduce a framework for representing and reasoning about the Activities of Daily Living of older adults living independently at home. The framework integrates data from sensors and contextual information that aggregates semi-structured interviews, home layouts and sociological observations from the participants. We use these data to create formal models, personalised for each participant according to their preferences and context. We formulate requirements that are specific to each individual as properties encoded in Linear Temporal Logic and use a model checker to verify whether each property is satisfied by the model. When a property is violated, a counterexample is generated giving the cause of the violation. We demonstrate the framework's generalisability by applying it to different participants, highlighting its potential to enhance the safety and well-being of older adults ageing in place.

Abstract: We present ONION, a multi-layered framework for participatory Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling that integrates insights from design justice, participatory AI, and conceptual modeling. ONION introduces a five-stage methodology: Observe, Nurture, Integrate, Optimize, Normalize. It supports progressive abstraction from unstructured stakeholder input to structured ER diagrams.
  Our approach aims to reduce designer bias, promote inclusive participation, and increase transparency through the modeling process. We evaluate ONION through real-world workshops focused on sociotechnical systems in Ukraine, highlighting how diverse stakeholder engagement leads to richer data models and deeper mutual understanding. Early results demonstrate ONION's potential to host diversity in early-stage data modeling. We conclude with lessons learned, limitations and challenges involved in scaling and refining the framework for broader adoption.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) play a critical role in enhancing large language models (LLMs) by introducing structured and grounded knowledge into the learning process. However, most existing KG-enhanced approaches rely on parameter-intensive fine-tuning, which risks catastrophic forgetting and degrades the pretrained model's generalization. Moreover, they exhibit limited adaptability to real-time knowledge updates due to their static integration frameworks. To address these issues, we introduce the first test-time KG-augmented framework for LLMs, built around a dedicated knowledge graph-guided attention (KGA) module that enables dynamic knowledge fusion without any parameter updates. The proposed KGA module augments the standard self-attention mechanism with two synergistic pathways: outward and inward aggregation. Specifically, the outward pathway dynamically integrates external knowledge into input representations via input-driven KG fusion. This inward aggregation complements the outward pathway by refining input representations through KG-guided filtering, suppressing task-irrelevant signals and amplifying knowledge-relevant patterns. Importantly, while the outward pathway handles knowledge fusion, the inward path selects the most relevant triples and feeds them back into the fusion process, forming a closed-loop enhancement mechanism. By synergistically combining these two pathways, the proposed method supports real-time knowledge fusion exclusively at test-time, without any parameter modification. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks verify the comparable knowledge fusion performance of KGA.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly improved code generation, yet most models remain text-only, neglecting crucial visual aids like diagrams and flowcharts used in real-world software development. To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-Coder, a Multilingual Multimodal software developer. MM-Coder integrates visual design inputs-Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams and flowcharts (termed Visual Workflow)-with textual instructions to enhance code generation accuracy and architectural alignment. To enable this, we developed MMc-Instruct, a diverse multimodal instruction-tuning dataset including visual-workflow-based code generation, allowing MM-Coder to synthesize textual and graphical information like human developers, distinct from prior work on narrow tasks. Furthermore, we introduce MMEval, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal code generation, addressing existing text-only limitations. Our evaluations using MMEval highlight significant remaining challenges for models in precise visual information capture, instruction following, and advanced programming knowledge. Our work aims to revolutionize industrial programming by enabling LLMs to interpret and implement complex specifications conveyed through both text and visual designs.

Abstract: Encountering shifted data at test time is a ubiquitous challenge when deploying predictive models. Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods address this issue by continuously adapting a deployed model using only unlabeled test data. While TTA can extend the model's lifespan, it is only a temporary solution. Eventually the model might degrade to the point that it must be taken offline and retrained. To detect such points of ultimate failure, we propose pairing TTA with risk monitoring frameworks that track predictive performance and raise alerts when predefined performance criteria are violated. Specifically, we extend existing monitoring tools based on sequential testing with confidence sequences to accommodate scenarios in which the model is updated at test time and no test labels are available to estimate the performance metrics of interest. Our extensions unlock the application of rigorous statistical risk monitoring to TTA, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed TTA monitoring framework across a representative set of datasets, distribution shift types, and TTA methods.

<title>Dually Hierarchical Drift Adaptation for Online Configuration Performance Learning</title>

Abstract: Modern configurable software systems need to learn models that correlate configuration and performance. However, when the system operates in dynamic environments, the workload variations, hardware changes, and system updates will inevitably introduce concept drifts at different levels - global drifts, which reshape the performance landscape of the entire configuration space; and local drifts, which only affect certain sub-regions of that space. As such, existing offline and transfer learning approaches can struggle to adapt to these implicit and unpredictable changes in real-time, rendering configuration performance learning challenging. To address this, we propose DHDA, an online configuration performance learning framework designed to capture and adapt to these drifts at different levels. The key idea is that DHDA adapts to both the local and global drifts using dually hierarchical adaptation: at the upper level, we redivide the data into different divisions, within each of which the local model is retrained, to handle global drifts only when necessary. At the lower level, the local models of the divisions can detect local drifts and adapt themselves asynchronously. To balance responsiveness and efficiency, DHDA combines incremental updates with periodic full retraining to minimize redundant computation when no drifts are detected. Through evaluating eight software systems and against state-of-the-art approaches, we show that DHDA achieves considerably better accuracy and can effectively adapt to drifts with up to 2x improvements, while incurring reasonable overhead and is able to improve different local models in handling concept drift.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting in deep neural networks occurs when learning new tasks degrades performance on previously learned tasks due to knowledge overwriting. Among the approaches to mitigate this issue, regularization techniques aim to identify and constrain "important" parameters to preserve previous knowledge. In the highly nonconvex optimization landscape of deep learning, we propose a novel perspective: tracking parameters during the final training plateau is more effective than monitoring them throughout the entire training process. We argue that parameters that exhibit higher activity (movement and variability) during this plateau reveal directions in the loss landscape that are relatively flat, making them suitable for adaptation to new tasks while preserving knowledge from previous ones. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves superior performance in balancing catastrophic forgetting mitigation with strong performance on newly learned tasks.

Abstract: Nonlinear vector autoregression (NVAR) and reservoir computing (RC) have shown promise in forecasting chaotic dynamical systems, such as the Lorenz-63 model and El Nino-Southern Oscillation. However, their reliance on fixed nonlinearities - polynomial expansions in NVAR or random feature maps in RC - limits their adaptability to high noise or real-world data. These methods also scale poorly in high-dimensional settings due to costly matrix inversion during readout computation. We propose an adaptive NVAR model that combines delay-embedded linear inputs with features generated by a shallow, learnable multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The MLP and linear readout are jointly trained using gradient-based optimization, enabling the model to learn data-driven nonlinearities while preserving a simple readout structure. Unlike standard NVAR, our approach avoids the need for an exhaustive and sensitive grid search over ridge and delay parameters. Instead, tuning is restricted to neural network hyperparameters, improving scalability. Initial experiments on chaotic systems tested under noise-free and synthetically noisy conditions showed that the adaptive model outperformed the standard NVAR in predictive accuracy and showed robust forecasting under noisy conditions with a lower observation frequency.

<title>Geo-ORBIT: A Federated Digital Twin Framework for Scene-Adaptive Lane Geometry Detection</title>

Abstract: Digital Twins (DT) have the potential to transform traffic management and operations by creating dynamic, virtual representations of transportation systems that sense conditions, analyze operations, and support decision-making. A key component for DT of the transportation system is dynamic roadway geometry sensing. However, existing approaches often rely on static maps or costly sensors, limiting scalability and adaptability. Additionally, large-scale DTs that collect and analyze data from multiple sources face challenges in privacy, communication, and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce Geo-ORBIT (Geometrical Operational Roadway Blueprint with Integrated Twin), a unified framework that combines real-time lane detection, DT synchronization, and federated meta-learning. At the core of Geo-ORBIT is GeoLane, a lightweight lane detection model that learns lane geometries from vehicle trajectory data using roadside cameras. We extend this model through Meta-GeoLane, which learns to personalize detection parameters for local entities, and FedMeta-GeoLane, a federated learning strategy that ensures scalable and privacy-preserving adaptation across roadside deployments. Our system is integrated with CARLA and SUMO to create a high-fidelity DT that renders highway scenarios and captures traffic flows in real-time. Extensive experiments across diverse urban scenes show that FedMeta-GeoLane consistently outperforms baseline and meta-learning approaches, achieving lower geometric error and stronger generalization to unseen locations while drastically reducing communication overhead. This work lays the foundation for flexible, context-aware infrastructure modeling in DTs. The framework is publicly available at https://github.com/raynbowy23/FedMeta-GeoLane.git.

<title>Penalizing Infeasible Actions and Reward Scaling in Reinforcement Learning with Offline Data</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08761</link>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with offline data suffers from Q-value extrapolation errors. To address this issue, we first demonstrate that linear extrapolation of the Q-function beyond the data range is particularly problematic. To mitigate this, we propose guiding the gradual decrease of Q-values outside the data range, which is achieved through reward scaling with layer normalization (RS-LN) and a penalization mechanism for infeasible actions (PA). By combining RS-LN and PA, we develop a new algorithm called PARS. We evaluate PARS across a range of tasks, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms in both offline training and online fine-tuning on the D4RL benchmark, with notable success in the challenging AntMaze Ultra task.

Abstract: Due to the excellent performance in yielding high-quality, zero-shot segmentation, Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its variants have been widely applied in diverse scenarios such as healthcare and intelligent manufacturing. Therefore, effectively compressing SAMs has become an increasingly pressing practical need. In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free compression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning, distillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility across model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model, and compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel compression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a dense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a low-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer operator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to significantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive experiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff performs consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio, post-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can achieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance drop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished within 60 seconds for all models.

Abstract: This study presents a hybrid model for classifying handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset, combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a multi-well Hopfield network. The approach employs a CNN to extract high-dimensional features from input images, which are then clustered into class-specific prototypes using k-means clustering. These prototypes serve as attractors in a multi-well energy landscape, where a Hopfield network performs classification by minimizing an energy function that balances feature similarity and class assignment.The model's design enables robust handling of intraclass variability, such as diverse handwriting styles, while providing an interpretable framework through its energy-based decision process. Through systematic optimization of the CNN architecture and the number of wells, the model achieves a high test accuracy of 99.2% on 10,000 MNIST images, demonstrating its effectiveness for image classification tasks. The findings highlight the critical role of deep feature extraction and sufficient prototype coverage in achieving high performance, with potential for broader applications in pattern recognition.

Abstract: In this study, we leverage a unique UNESCO collection of mid-20th century radio recordings to probe the robustness of modern off-the-shelf language identification (LID) and speaker recognition (SR) methods, especially with respect to the impact of multilingual speakers and cross-age recordings. Our findings suggest that LID systems, such as Whisper, are increasingly adept at handling second-language and accented speech. However, speaker embeddings remain a fragile component of speech processing pipelines that is prone to biases related to the channel, age, and language. Issues which will need to be overcome should archives aim to employ SR methods for speaker indexing.

<title>Optimistic Exploration for Risk-Averse Constrained Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Risk-averse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RaCRL) aims to learn policies that minimise the likelihood of rare and catastrophic constraint violations caused by an environment's inherent randomness. In general, risk-aversion leads to conservative exploration of the environment which typically results in converging to sub-optimal policies that fail to adequately maximise reward or, in some cases, fail to achieve the goal. In this paper, we propose an exploration-based approach for RaCRL called Optimistic Risk-averse Actor Critic (ORAC), which constructs an exploratory policy by maximising a local upper confidence bound of the state-action reward value function whilst minimising a local lower confidence bound of the risk-averse state-action cost value function. Specifically, at each step, the weighting assigned to the cost value is increased or decreased if it exceeds or falls below the safety constraint value. This way the policy is encouraged to explore uncertain regions of the environment to discover high reward states whilst still satisfying the safety constraints. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ORAC approach prevents convergence to sub-optimal policies and improves significantly the reward-cost trade-off in various continuous control tasks such as Safety-Gymnasium and a complex building energy management environment CityLearn.

arXiv:2507.08799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose cache steering, a lightweight method for implicit steering of language models via a one-shot intervention applied directly to the key-value cache. To validate its effectiveness, we apply cache steering to induce chain-of-thought reasoning in small language models. Our approach leverages GPT-4o-generated reasoning traces to construct steering vectors that shift model behavior toward more explicit, multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning or prompt modifications. Experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that cache steering improves both the qualitative structure of model reasoning and quantitative task performance. Compared to prior activation steering techniques that require continuous interventions, our one-shot cache steering offers substantial advantages in terms of hyperparameter stability, inference-time efficiency, and ease of integration, making it a more robust and practical solution for controlled generation.

Abstract: We introduce NeuralOS, a neural framework that simulates graphical user interfaces (GUIs) of operating systems by directly predicting screen frames in response to user inputs such as mouse movements, clicks, and keyboard events. NeuralOS combines a recurrent neural network (RNN), which tracks computer state, with a diffusion-based neural renderer that generates screen images. The model is trained on a large-scale dataset of Ubuntu XFCE recordings, which include both randomly generated interactions and realistic interactions produced by AI agents. Experiments show that NeuralOS successfully renders realistic GUI sequences, accurately captures mouse interactions, and reliably predicts state transitions like application launches. Although modeling fine-grained keyboard interactions precisely remains challenging, NeuralOS offers a step toward creating fully adaptive, generative neural interfaces for future human-computer interaction systems.

<title>Lumos-1: On Autoregressive Video Generation from a Unified Model Perspective</title>

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have unified a vast range of language tasks, inspiring preliminary efforts in autoregressive video generation. Existing autoregressive video generators either diverge from standard LLM architectures, depend on bulky external text encoders, or incur prohibitive latency due to next-token decoding. In this paper, we introduce Lumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture with minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations in LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its imbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE scheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive frequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal spatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy that obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality. Based on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss imbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing Autoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal tube masking during training with a compatible inference-time masking policy to avoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we pre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on GenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V. Code and models are available at https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/Lumos.

<title>Interpreting systems as solving POMDPs: a step towards a formal understanding of agency</title>

Abstract: Under what circumstances can a system be said to have beliefs and goals, and how do such agency-related features relate to its physical state? Recent work has proposed a notion of interpretation map, a function that maps the state of a system to a probability distribution representing its beliefs about an external world. Such a map is not completely arbitrary, as the beliefs it attributes to the system must evolve over time in a manner that is consistent with Bayes' theorem, and consequently the dynamics of a system constrain its possible interpretations. Here we build on this approach, proposing a notion of interpretation not just in terms of beliefs but in terms of goals and actions. To do this we make use of the existing theory of partially observable Markov processes (POMDPs): we say that a system can be interpreted as a solution to a POMDP if it not only admits an interpretation map describing its beliefs about the hidden state of a POMDP but also takes actions that are optimal according to its belief state. An agent is then a system together with an interpretation of this system as a POMDP solution. Although POMDPs are not the only possible formulation of what it means to have a goal, this nevertheless represents a step towards a more general formal definition of what it means for a system to be an agent.

Abstract: The conventional BIM authoring process typically requires designers to master complex and tedious modeling commands in order to materialize their design intentions within BIM authoring tools. This additional cognitive burden complicates the design process and hinders the adoption of BIM and model-based design in the AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) industry. To facilitate the expression of design intentions more intuitively, we propose Text2BIM, an LLM-based multi-agent framework that can generate 3D building models from natural language instructions. This framework orchestrates multiple LLM agents to collaborate and reason, transforming textual user input into imperative code that invokes the BIM authoring tool's APIs, thereby generating editable BIM models with internal layouts, external envelopes, and semantic information directly in the software. Furthermore, a rule-based model checker is introduced into the agentic workflow, utilizing predefined domain knowledge to guide the LLM agents in resolving issues within the generated models and iteratively improving model quality. Extensive experiments were conducted to compare and analyze the performance of three different LLMs under the proposed framework. The evaluation results demonstrate that our approach can effectively generate high-quality, structurally rational building models that are aligned with the abstract concepts specified by user input. Finally, an interactive software prototype was developed to integrate the framework into the BIM authoring software Vectorworks, showcasing the potential of modeling by chatting. The code is available at: https://github.com/dcy0577/Text2BIM

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based AI delegates are increasingly utilized to act on behalf of users, assisting them with a wide range of tasks through conversational interfaces. Despite their advantages, concerns arise regarding the potential risk of privacy leaks, particularly in scenarios involving social interactions. While existing research has focused on protecting privacy by limiting the access of AI delegates to sensitive user information, many social scenarios require disclosing private details to achieve desired social goals, necessitating a balance between privacy protection and disclosure. To address this challenge, we first conduct a pilot study to investigate user perceptions of AI delegates across various social relations and task scenarios, and then propose a novel AI delegate system that enables privacy-conscious self-disclosure. Our user study demonstrates that the proposed AI delegate strategically protects privacy, pioneering its use in diverse and dynamic social interactions.

Abstract: In cognition theory, human thinking is governed by two systems: the fast and intuitive System 1 and the slower but more deliberative System 2. Analogously, Large Language Models (LLMs) can operate in two reasoning modes: outputting only the solutions (\emph{fast mode}) or both the reasoning chain and the final solution (\emph{slow mode}). We present \dualformer, a single Transformer model that seamlessly integrates both the fast and slow reasoning modes by training on randomized reasoning traces, where different parts of the traces are strategically dropped during training. At inference time, \dualformer can be easily configured to execute in either fast or slow mode, or automatically decide which mode to engage (\emph{auto mode}). It outperforms baselines in both performance and computational efficiency across all three modes: (1) in slow mode, \dualformer achieves $97.6\%$ optimal rate on unseen $30 \times 30$ maze tasks, surpassing the \searchformer baseline ($93.3\%$) trained on data with complete reasoning traces, with $45.5\%$ fewer reasoning steps; (2) in fast mode, \dualformer achieves $80\%$ optimal rate, significantly outperforming the Solution-Only model trained on solution-only data, which has an optimal rate of only $30\%$; (3) in auto mode, \dualformer achieves $96.6\%$ optimal rate with $59.9\%$ fewer steps than \searchformer. Moreover, \dualformer produces more diverse reasoning traces than \searchformer{}. For math reasoning problems, our techniques have also achieved improved performance with LLM fine-tuning, demonstrating its generalization beyond task-specific models. We open source our code at https://github.com/facebookresearch/dualformer.

Abstract: Prompt optimization aims to search for effective prompts that enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs). Although existing prompt optimization methods have discovered effective prompts, they often differ from sophisticated prompts carefully designed by human experts. Prompt design strategies, representing best practices for improving prompt performance, can be key to improving prompt optimization. Recently, a method termed the Autonomous Prompt Engineering Toolbox (APET) has incorporated various prompt design strategies into the prompt optimization process. In APET, the LLM is needed to implicitly select and apply the appropriate strategies because prompt design strategies can have negative effects. This implicit selection may be suboptimal due to the limited optimization capabilities of LLMs. This paper introduces Optimizing Prompts with sTrategy Selection (OPTS), which implements explicit selection mechanisms for prompt design. We propose three mechanisms, including a Thompson sampling-based approach, and integrate them into EvoPrompt, a well-known prompt optimizer. Experiments optimizing prompts for two LLMs, Llama-3-8B-Instruct and GPT-4o mini, were conducted using BIG-Bench Hard. Our results show that the selection of prompt design strategies improves the performance of EvoPrompt, and the Thompson sampling-based mechanism achieves the best overall results. Our experimental code is provided at https://github.com/shiralab/OPTS .

Abstract: Epistemic injustice related to AI is a growing concern. In relation to machine learning models, epistemic injustice can have a diverse range of sources, ranging from epistemic opacity, the discriminatory automation of testimonial prejudice, and the distortion of human beliefs via generative AI's hallucinations to the exclusion of the global South in global AI governance, the execution of bureaucratic violence via algorithmic systems, and interactions with conversational artificial agents. Based on a proposed general taxonomy of epistemic injustice, this paper first sketches a taxonomy of the types of epistemic injustice in the context of AI, relying on the work of scholars from the fields of philosophy of technology, political philosophy and social epistemology. Secondly, an additional conceptualization on epistemic injustice in the context of AI is provided: generative hermeneutical erasure. I argue that this injustice the automation of 'epistemicide', the injustice done to epistemic agents in their capacity for collective sense-making through the suppression of difference in epistemology and conceptualization by LLMs. AI systems' 'view from nowhere' epistemically inferiorizes non-Western epistemologies and thereby contributes to the erosion of their epistemic particulars, gradually contributing to hermeneutical erasure. This work's relevance lies in proposal of a taxonomy that allows epistemic injustices to be mapped in the AI domain and the proposal of a novel form of AI-related epistemic injustice.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework for Satisfiability Modulo the Theory of Nonlinear Real Arithmetic (SMT-NRA for short). First, we introduce a two-dimensional cell-jump move, called \emph{$2d$-cell-jump}, generalizing the key operation, cell-jump, of the local search method for SMT-NRA. Then, we propose an extended local search framework, named \emph{$2d$-LS} (following the local search framework, LS, for SMT-NRA), integrating the model constructing satisfiability calculus (MCSAT) framework to improve search efficiency. To further improve the efficiency of MCSAT, we implement a recently proposed technique called \emph{sample-cell projection operator} for MCSAT, which is well suited for CDCL-style search in the real domain and helps guide the search away from conflicting states. Finally, we present a hybrid framework for SMT-NRA integrating MCSAT, $2d$-LS and OpenCAD, to improve search efficiency through information exchange. The experimental results demonstrate improvements in local search performance, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of financial transactions among people is critical for various applications such as fraud detection. One important aspect of financial transaction networks is temporality. The order and repetition of transactions can offer new insights when considered within the graph structure. Temporal motifs, defined as a set of nodes that interact with each other in a short time period, are a promising tool in this context. In this work, we study three unique temporal financial networks: transactions in Mercari, an online marketplace, payments in a synthetic network generated by J.P. Morgan Chase, and payments and friendships among Venmo users. We consider the fraud detection problem on the Mercari and J.P. Morgan Chase networks, for which the ground truth is available. We show that temporal motifs offer superior performance to several baselines, including a previous method that considers simple graph features and two node embedding techniques (LINE and node2vec), while being practical in terms of runtime performance. For the Venmo network, we investigate the interplay between financial and social relations on three tasks: friendship prediction, vendor identification, and analysis of temporal cycles. For friendship prediction, temporal motifs yield better results than general heuristics, such as Jaccard and Adamic-Adar measures. We are also able to identify vendors with high accuracy and observe interesting patterns in rare motifs, such as temporal cycles. We believe that the analysis, datasets, and lessons from this work will be beneficial for future research on financial transaction networks.

Abstract: With the advancement of vision-based autonomous driving technology, pedestrian detection have become an important component for improving traffic safety and driving system robustness. Nevertheless, in complex traffic scenarios, conventional pose estimation approaches frequently fail to accurately reconstruct occluded keypoints, primarily due to obstructions caused by vehicles, vegetation, or architectural elements. To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time occluded pedestrian pose completion framework termed Separation and Dimensionality Reduction-based Generative Adversarial Imputation Nets (SDR-GAIN). Unlike previous approaches that train visual models to distinguish occlusion patterns, SDR-GAIN aims to learn human pose directly from the numerical distribution of keypoint coordinates and interpolate missing positions. It employs a self-supervised adversarial learning paradigm to train lightweight generators with residual structures for the imputation of missing pose keypoints. Additionally, it integrates multiple pose standardization techniques to alleviate the difficulty of the learning process. Experiments conducted on the COCO and JAAD datasets demonstrate that SDR-GAIN surpasses conventional machine learning and Transformer-based missing data interpolation algorithms in accurately recovering occluded pedestrian keypoints, while simultaneously achieving microsecond-level real-time inference.

Abstract: Objectieve:This review aims to deliver a comprehensive analysis of Large Language Models (LLMs) utilization in mental health care, evaluating their effectiveness, identifying challenges, and exploring their potential for future application. Materials and Methods: A systematic search was performed across multiple databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, arXiv, medRxiv, and PsyArXiv in November 2023. The review includes all types of original research, regardless of peer-review status, published or disseminated between October 1, 2019, and December 2, 2023. Studies were included without language restrictions if they employed LLMs developed after T5 and directly investigated research questions within mental health care settings. Results: Out of an initial 313 articles, 34 were selected based on their relevance to LLMs applications in mental health care and the rigor of their reported outcomes. The review identified various LLMs applications in mental health care, including diagnostics, therapy, and enhancing patient engagement. Key challenges highlighted were related to data availability and reliability, the nuanced handling of mental states, and effective evaluation methods. While LLMs showed promise in improving accuracy and accessibility, significant gaps in clinical applicability and ethical considerations were noted. Conclusion: LLMs hold substantial promise for enhancing mental health care. For their full potential to be realized, emphasis must be placed on developing robust datasets, development and evaluation frameworks, ethical guidelines, and interdisciplinary collaborations to address current limitations.

Abstract: Predicting the future trajectories of pedestrians on the road is an important task for autonomous driving. The pedestrian trajectory prediction is affected by scene paths, pedestrian's intentions and decision-making, which is a multi-modal problem. Most recent studies use past trajectories to predict a variety of potential future trajectory distributions, which do not account for the scene context and pedestrian targets. Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, we propose to use scene context and observed trajectory to predict the goal points first, and then reuse the goal points to predict the future trajectories. By leveraging the information from scene context and observed trajectory, the uncertainty can be limited to a few target areas, which represent the "goals" of the pedestrians. In this paper, we propose GoalNet, a new trajectory prediction neural network based on the goal areas of a pedestrian. Our network can predict both pedestrian's trajectories and bounding boxes. The overall model is efficient and modular, and its outputs can be changed according to the usage scenario. Experimental results show that GoalNet significantly improves the previous state-of-the-art performance by 48.7% on the JAAD and 40.8% on the PIE dataset.

Abstract: Speculative decoding reduces the inference latency of a target large language model via utilizing a smaller and faster draft model. Its performance depends on a hyperparameter K -- the candidate length, i.e., the number of candidate tokens for the target model to verify in each round. However, previous methods often use simple heuristics to choose K, which may result in sub-optimal performance. We study the choice of the candidate length K and formulate it as a Markov Decision Process. We theoretically show that the optimal policy of this Markov decision process takes the form of a threshold policy, i.e., the current speculation should stop and be verified when the probability of getting a rejection exceeds a threshold value. Motivated by this theory, we propose SpecDec++, an enhanced version of speculative decoding that adaptively determines the candidate length on the fly. We augment the draft model with a trained acceptance prediction head to predict the conditional acceptance probability of the candidate tokens. SpecDec++ will stop the current speculation when the predicted probability that at least one token gets rejected exceeds a threshold. We implement SpecDec++ and apply it to the llama-2-chat 7B & 70B model pair. Our adaptive method achieves a 2.04x speedup on the Alpaca dataset (7.2% improvement over the baseline speculative decoding). On the GSM8K and HumanEval datasets, our method achieves a 2.26x speedup (9.4% improvement) and 2.23x speedup (11.1% improvement), respectively. The code of this paper is available at https://github.com/Kaffaljidhmah2/SpecDec_pp.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel in various natural language tasks in English, their performance in lower-resourced languages like Hebrew, especially for generative tasks such as abstractive summarization, remains unclear. The high morphological richness in Hebrew adds further challenges due to the ambiguity in sentence comprehension and the complexities in meaning construction. In this paper, we address this resource and evaluation gap by introducing HeSum, a novel benchmark specifically designed for abstractive text summarization in Modern Hebrew. HeSum consists of 10,000 article-summary pairs sourced from Hebrew news websites written by professionals. Linguistic analysis confirms HeSum's high abstractness and unique morphological challenges. We show that HeSum presents distinct difficulties for contemporary state-of-the-art LLMs, establishing it as a valuable testbed for generative language technology in Hebrew, and MRLs generative challenges in general.

<title>Evaluating Implicit Bias in Large Language Models by Attacking From a Psychometric Perspective</title>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become an important way of information access, there have been increasing concerns that LLMs may intensify the spread of unethical content, including implicit bias that hurts certain populations without explicit harmful words. In this paper, we conduct a rigorous evaluation of LLMs' implicit bias towards certain demographics by attacking them from a psychometric perspective to elicit agreements to biased viewpoints. Inspired by psychometric principles in cognitive and social psychology, we propose three attack approaches, i.e., Disguise, Deception, and Teaching. Incorporating the corresponding attack instructions, we built two benchmarks: (1) a bilingual dataset with biased statements covering four bias types (2.7K instances) for extensive comparative analysis, and (2) BUMBLE, a larger benchmark spanning nine common bias types (12.7K instances) for comprehensive evaluation. Extensive evaluation of popular commercial and open-source LLMs shows that our methods can elicit LLMs' inner bias more effectively than competitive baselines. Our attack methodology and benchmarks offer an effective means of assessing the ethical risks of LLMs, driving progress toward greater accountability in their development. Our code, data, and benchmarks are available at https://yuchenwen1.github.io/ImplicitBiasEvaluation/.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to help with writing formulas in spreadsheets, but resources on these formulas are scarce, impacting both the base performance of pre-trained models and limiting the ability to fine-tune them. Given a corpus of formulas, we can use a(nother) model to generate synthetic natural language utterances for fine-tuning. However, it is important to validate whether the NL generated by the LLM is indeed accurate to be beneficial for fine-tuning. In this paper, we provide empirical results on the impact of validating these synthetic training examples with surrogate objectives that evaluate the accuracy of the synthetic annotations. We demonstrate that validation improves performance over raw data across four models (2 open and 2 closed weight). Interestingly, we show that although validation tends to prune more challenging examples, it increases the complexity of problems that models can solve after being fine-tuned on validated data.

<title>Quantifying Context Bias in Domain Adaptation for Object Detection</title>

Abstract: Domain adaptation for object detection (DAOD) has become essential to counter performance degradation caused by distribution shifts between training and deployment domains. However, a critical factor influencing DAOD - context bias resulting from learned foreground-background (FG-BG) associations - has remained underexplored. We address three key questions regarding FG BG associations in object detection: are FG-BG associations encoded during the training, is there a causal relationship between FG-BG associations and detection performance, and is there an effect of FG-BG association on DAOD. To examine how models capture FG BG associations, we analyze class-wise and feature-wise performance degradation using background masking and feature perturbation, measured via change in accuracies (defined as drop rate). To explore the causal role of FG-BG associations, we apply do-calculus on FG-BG pairs guided by class activation mapping (CAM). To quantify the causal influence of FG-BG associations across domains, we propose a novel metric - domain association gradient - defined as the ratio of drop rate to maximum mean discrepancy (MMD). Through systematic experiments involving background masking, feature-level perturbations, and CAM, we reveal that convolution-based object detection models encode FG-BG associations. Our results demonstrate that context bias not only exists but causally undermines the generalization capabilities of object detection models across domains. Furthermore, we validate these findings across multiple models and datasets, including state-of-the-art architectures such as ALDI++. This study highlights the necessity of addressing context bias explicitly in DAOD frameworks, providing insights that pave the way for developing more robust and generalizable object detection systems.

<title>Downscaling Extreme Precipitation with Wasserstein Regularized Diffusion</title>

Abstract: Understanding the risks posed by extreme rainfall events necessitates both high-resolution products (to assess localized hazards) and extensive historical records (to capture rare occurrences). Radar and mesonet networks provide kilometer-scale precipitation fields, but with limited historical records and geographical coverage. Conversely, global gauge and blended products span decades, yet their coarse 30-50 km grids obscure local extremes. This work introduces Wasserstein Regularized Diffusion (WassDiff), a generative downscaling framework that integrates diffusion modeling with a distribution-matching (Wasserstein) regularizer, suppressing bias throughout the entire generative denoising process. Conditioned on 55 km CPC gauge-based precipitation and the 31 km ERA5 reanalysis, WassDiff generates 1 km precipitation estimates that remain well-calibrated to targets across the full intensity range, including the extremes. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that WassDiff outperforms existing state-of-the-art downscaling methods, delivering lower reconstruction error and reduced bias. Case studies further demonstrate its ability to reproduce realistic fine-scale structures and accurate peak intensities from extreme weather phenomena, such as tropical storms and cold fronts. By unlocking decades of high-resolution rainfall information from globally available coarse records, WassDiff offers a practical pathway toward more accurate flood-risk assessments and climate-adaptation planning.

Abstract: Climate change communication on social media increasingly employs microtargeting strategies to effectively reach and influence specific demographic groups. This study presents a post-hoc analysis of microtargeting practices within climate campaigns by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to examine Facebook advertisements. Our analysis focuses on two key aspects: demographic targeting and fairness. We evaluate the ability of LLMs to accurately predict the intended demographic targets, such as gender and age group, achieving an overall accuracy of 88.55%. Furthermore, we instruct the LLMs to generate explanations for their classifications, providing transparent reasoning behind each decision. These explanations reveal the specific thematic elements used to engage different demographic segments, highlighting distinct strategies tailored to various audiences. Our findings show that young adults are primarily targeted through messages emphasizing activism and environmental consciousness, while women are engaged through themes related to caregiving roles and social advocacy. In addition to evaluating the effectiveness of LLMs in detecting microtargeted messaging, we conduct a comprehensive fairness analysis to identify potential biases in model predictions. Our findings indicate that while LLMs perform well overall, certain biases exist, particularly in the classification of senior citizens and male audiences. By showcasing the efficacy of LLMs in dissecting and explaining targeted communication strategies and by highlighting fairness concerns, this study provides a valuable framework for future research aimed at enhancing transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in social media-driven climate campaigns.

Abstract: Speech clarity and spatial audio immersion are the two most critical factors in enhancing remote conferencing experiences. Existing methods are often limited: either due to the lack of spatial information when using only one microphone, or because their performance is highly dependent on the accuracy of direction-of-arrival estimation when using microphone array. To overcome this issue, we introduce an end-to-end deep learning framework that has the capacity of mapping multi-channel noisy and reverberant signals to clean and spatialized binaural speech directly. This framework unifies source extraction, noise suppression, and binaural rendering into one network. In this framework, a novel magnitude-weighted interaural level difference loss function is proposed that aims to improve the accuracy of spatial rendering. Extensive evaluations show that our method outperforms established baselines in terms of both speech quality and spatial fidelity.

Abstract: Compositional generalization is a crucial step towards developing data-efficient intelligent machines that generalize in human-like ways. In this work, we tackle a challenging form of distribution shift, termed compositional shift, where some attribute combinations are completely absent at training but present in the test distribution. This shift tests the model's ability to generalize compositionally to novel attribute combinations in discriminative tasks. We model the data with flexible additive energy distributions, where each energy term represents an attribute, and derive a simple alternative to empirical risk minimization termed compositional risk minimization (CRM). We first train an additive energy classifier to predict the multiple attributes and then adjust this classifier to tackle compositional shifts. We provide an extensive theoretical analysis of CRM, where we show that our proposal extrapolates to special affine hulls of seen attribute combinations. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets confirms the improved robustness of CRM compared to other methods from the literature designed to tackle various forms of subpopulation shifts.

Abstract: A neural network with one hidden layer or a two-layer network (regardless of the input layer) is the simplest feedforward neural network, whose mechanism may be the basis of more general network architectures. However, even to this type of simple architecture, it is also a ``black box''; that is, it remains unclear how to interpret the mechanism of its solutions obtained by the back-propagation algorithm and how to control the training process through a deterministic way. This paper systematically studies the first problem by constructing universal function-approximation solutions. It is shown that, both theoretically and experimentally, the training solution for the one-dimensional input could be completely understood, and that for a higher-dimensional input can also be well interpreted to some extent. Those results pave the way for thoroughly revealing the black box of two-layer ReLU networks and advance the understanding of deep ReLU networks.

Abstract: Visual text rendering are widespread in various real-world applications, requiring careful font selection and typographic choices. Recent progress in diffusion transformer (DiT)-based text-to-image (T2I) models show promise in automating these processes. However, these methods still encounter challenges like inconsistent fonts, style variation, and limited fine-grained control, particularly at the word-level. This paper proposes a two-stage DiT-based pipeline to address these problems by enhancing controllability over typography and style in text rendering. We introduce typography control fine-tuning (TC-FT), an parameter-efficient fine-tuning method (on $5\%$ key parameters) with enclosing typography control tokens (ETC-tokens), which enables precise word-level application of typographic features. To further address style inconsistency in text rendering, we propose a text-agnostic style control adapter (SCA) that prevents content leakage while enhancing style consistency. To implement TC-FT and SCA effectively, we incorporated HTML-render into the data synthesis pipeline and proposed the first word-level controllable dataset. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving superior word-level typographic control, font consistency, and style consistency in text rendering tasks. The datasets and models will be available for academic use.

Abstract: Time series forecasting often demands a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. While recent Transformer models have improved forecasting capabilities, they come with high computational costs. Linear-based models have shown better accuracy than Transformers but still fall short of ideal performance. We propose PIAD-SRNN, a physics-informed adaptive decomposition state-space RNN, that separates seasonal and trend components and embeds domain equations in a recurrent framework. We evaluate PIAD-SRNN's performance on indoor air quality datasets, focusing on CO2 concentration prediction across various forecasting horizons, and results demonstrate that it consistently outperforms SoTA models in both long-term and short-term time series forecasting, including transformer-based architectures, in terms of both MSE and MAE. Besides proposing PIAD-SRNN which balances accuracy with efficiency, this paper also provides four curated datasets. Code and data: https://github.com/ahmad-shirazi/DSSRNN

Abstract: Point transformers have demonstrated remarkable progress in 3D understanding through expanded receptive fields (RF), but further expanding the RF leads to dilution in group attention and decreases detailed feature extraction capability. Proxy, which serves as abstract representations for simplifying feature maps, enables global RF. However, existing proxy-based approaches face critical limitations: Global proxies incur quadratic complexity for large-scale point clouds and suffer positional ambiguity, while local proxy alternatives struggle with 1) Unreliable sampling from the geometrically diverse point cloud, 2) Inefficient proxy interaction computation, and 3) Imbalanced local-global information fusion; To address these challenges, we propose Sparse Proxy Point Transformer (SP$^{2}$T) -- a local proxy-based dual-stream point transformer with three key innovations: First, for reliable sampling, spatial-wise proxy sampling with vertex-based associations enables robust sampling on geometrically diverse point clouds. Second, for efficient proxy interaction, sparse proxy attention with a table-based relative bias effectively achieves the interaction with efficient map-reduce computation. Third, for local-global information fusion, our dual-stream architecture maintains local-global balance through parallel branches. Comprehensive experiments reveal that SP$^{2}$T sets state-of-the-art results with acceptable latency on indoor and outdoor 3D comprehension benchmarks, demonstrating marked improvement (+3.8% mIoU vs. SPoTr@S3DIS, +22.9% mIoU vs. PointASNL@Sem.KITTI) compared to other proxy-based point cloud methods.

Abstract: We propose Electrostatic Field Matching (EFM), a novel method that is suitable for both generative modeling and distribution transfer tasks. Our approach is inspired by the physics of an electrical capacitor. We place source and target distributions on the capacitor plates and assign them positive and negative charges, respectively. We then learn the electrostatic field of the capacitor using a neural network approximator. To map the distributions to each other, we start at one plate of the capacitor and move the samples along the learned electrostatic field lines until they reach the other plate. We theoretically justify that this approach provably yields the distribution transfer. In practice, we demonstrate the performance of our EFM in toy and image data experiments.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable outcome rewards (RLVR) has effectively scaled up chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Yet, its efficacy in training vision-language model (VLM) agents for goal-directed action reasoning in visual environments is less established. This work investigates this problem through extensive experiments on complex card games, such as 24 points, and embodied tasks from ALFWorld. We find that when rewards are based solely on action outcomes, RL fails to incentivize CoT reasoning in VLMs, instead leading to a phenomenon we termed thought collapse, characterized by a rapid loss of diversity in the agent's thoughts, state-irrelevant and incomplete reasoning, and subsequent invalid actions, resulting in negative rewards. To counteract thought collapse, we highlight the necessity of process guidance and propose an automated corrector that evaluates and refines the agent's reasoning at each RL step. This simple and scalable GTR (Guided Thought Reinforcement) framework trains reasoning and action simultaneously without the need for dense, per-step human labeling. Our experiments demonstrate that GTR significantly enhances the performance and generalization of the LLaVA-7b model across various visual environments, achieving 3-5 times higher task success rates compared to SoTA models with notably smaller model sizes.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dataset REGEN (Reviews Enhanced with GEnerative Narratives), designed to benchmark the conversational capabilities of recommender Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing the limitations of existing datasets that primarily focus on sequential item prediction. REGEN extends the Amazon Product Reviews dataset by inpainting two key natural language features: (1) user critiques, representing user "steering" queries that lead to the selection of a subsequent item, and (2) narratives, rich textual outputs associated with each recommended item taking into account prior context. The narratives include product endorsements, purchase explanations, and summaries of user preferences.
  Further, we establish an end-to-end modeling benchmark for the task of conversational recommendation, where models are trained to generate both recommendations and corresponding narratives conditioned on user history (items and critiques). For this joint task, we introduce a modeling framework LUMEN (LLM-based Unified Multi-task Model with Critiques, Recommendations, and Narratives) which uses an LLM as a backbone for critiquing, retrieval and generation. We also evaluate the dataset's quality using standard auto-rating techniques and benchmark it by training both traditional and LLM-based recommender models. Our results demonstrate that incorporating critiques enhances recommendation quality by enabling the recommender to learn language understanding and integrate it with recommendation signals. Furthermore, LLMs trained on our dataset effectively generate both recommendations and contextual narratives, achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art recommenders and language models.

Abstract: This paper introduces the largest and most comprehensive dataset of US presidential campaign television advertisements, available in digital format. The dataset also includes machine-searchable transcripts and high-quality summaries designed to facilitate a variety of academic research. To date, there has been great interest in collecting and analyzing US presidential campaign advertisements, but the need for manual procurement and annotation led many to rely on smaller subsets. We design a large-scale parallelized, AI-based analysis pipeline that automates the laborious process of preparing, transcribing, and summarizing videos. We then apply this methodology to the 9,707 presidential ads from the Julian P. Kanter Political Commercial Archive. We conduct extensive human evaluations to show that these transcripts and summaries match the quality of manually generated alternatives. We illustrate the value of this data by including an application that tracks the genesis and evolution of current focal issue areas over seven decades of presidential elections. Our analysis pipeline and codebase also show how to use LLM-based tools to obtain high-quality summaries for other video datasets.

Abstract: Traditional sparse and dense retrieval methods struggle to leverage general world knowledge and often fail to capture the nuanced features of queries and products. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), industrial search systems have started to employ LLMs to generate identifiers for product retrieval. Commonly used identifiers include (1) static/semantic IDs and (2) product term sets. The first approach requires creating a product ID system from scratch, missing out on the world knowledge embedded within LLMs. While the second approach leverages this general knowledge, the significant difference in word distribution between queries and products means that product-based identifiers often do not align well with user search queries, leading to missed product recalls. Furthermore, when queries contain numerous attributes, these algorithms generate a large number of identifiers, making it difficult to assess their quality, which results in low overall recall efficiency.
  To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel e-commerce retrieval paradigm: the Generative Retrieval and Alignment Model (GRAM). GRAM employs joint training on text information from both queries and products to generate shared text identifier codes, effectively bridging the gap between queries and products. This approach not only enhances the connection between queries and products but also improves inference efficiency. The model uses a co-alignment strategy to generate codes optimized for maximizing retrieval efficiency. Additionally, it introduces a query-product scoring mechanism to compare product values across different codes, further boosting retrieval efficiency. Extensive offline and online A/B testing demonstrates that GRAM significantly outperforms traditional models and the latest generative retrieval models, confirming its effectiveness and practicality.

Abstract: This paper presents MedSegFactory, a versatile medical synthesis framework that generates high-quality paired medical images and segmentation masks across modalities and tasks. It aims to serve as an unlimited data repository, supplying image-mask pairs to enhance existing segmentation tools. The core of MedSegFactory is a dual-stream diffusion model, where one stream synthesizes medical images and the other generates corresponding segmentation masks. To ensure precise alignment between image-mask pairs, we introduce Joint Cross-Attention (JCA), enabling a collaborative denoising paradigm by dynamic cross-conditioning between streams. This bidirectional interaction allows both representations to guide each other's generation, enhancing consistency between generated pairs. MedSegFactory unlocks on-demand generation of paired medical images and segmentation masks through user-defined prompts that specify the target labels, imaging modalities, anatomical regions, and pathological conditions, facilitating scalable and high-quality data generation. This new paradigm of medical image synthesis enables seamless integration into diverse medical imaging workflows, enhancing both efficiency and accuracy. Extensive experiments show that MedSegFactory generates data of superior quality and usability, achieving competitive or state-of-the-art performance in 2D and 3D segmentation tasks while addressing data scarcity and regulatory constraints.

Abstract: Computer vision is transforming fashion industry through Virtual Try-On (VTON) and Virtual Try-Off (VTOFF). VTON generates images of a person in a specified garment using a target photo and a standardized garment image, while a more challenging variant, Person-to-Person Virtual Try-On (p2p-VTON), uses a photo of another person wearing the garment. VTOFF, in contrast, extracts standardized garment images from photos of clothed individuals. We introduce Multi-Garment TryOffDiff (MGT), a diffusion-based VTOFF model capable of handling diverse garment types, including upper-body, lower-body, and dresses. MGT builds on a latent diffusion architecture with SigLIP-based image conditioning to capture garment characteristics such as shape, texture, and pattern. To address garment diversity, MGT incorporates class-specific embeddings, achieving state-of-the-art VTOFF results on VITON-HD and competitive performance on DressCode. When paired with VTON models, it further enhances p2p-VTON by reducing unwanted attribute transfer, such as skin tone, ensuring preservation of person-specific characteristics.

Abstract: Current efforts in AI safety prioritize filtering harmful content, preventing manipulation of human behavior, and eliminating existential risks in cybersecurity or biosecurity. While pressing, this narrow focus overlooks critical human-centric considerations that shape the long-term trajectory of a society. In this position paper, we identify the risks of overlooking the impact of AI on the future of work and recommend comprehensive transition support towards the evolution of meaningful labor with human agency. Through the lens of economic theories, we highlight the intertemporal impacts of AI on human livelihood and the structural changes in labor markets that exacerbate income inequality. Additionally, the closed-source approach of major stakeholders in AI development resembles rent-seeking behavior through exploiting resources, breeding mediocrity in creative labor, and monopolizing innovation. To address this, we argue in favor of a robust international copyright anatomy supported by implementing collective licensing that ensures fair compensation mechanisms for using data to train AI models. We strongly recommend a pro-worker framework of global AI governance to enhance shared prosperity and economic justice while reducing technical debt.

arXiv:2504.18246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) on multi-turn reasoning datasets requires N (number of turns) separate forward passes per conversation due to reasoning token visibility constraints, as reasoning tokens for a turn are discarded in subsequent turns. We propose duplicating response tokens along with a custom attention mask to enable single-pass processing of entire conversations. We prove our method produces identical losses to the N-pass approach while reducing time complexity from $O\bigl(N^{3}\bigl)$ to $O\bigl(N^{2}\bigl)$ and maintaining the same memory complexity for a transformer based model. Our approach achieves significant training speedup while preserving accuracy. Our implementation is available online (https://github.com/devrev/One-Pass-to-Reason).

Abstract: We present the design process and findings of the pre-conference workshop at the Machine Learning for Healthcare Conference (2024) entitled Red Teaming Large Language Models for Healthcare, which took place on August 15, 2024. Conference participants, comprising a mix of computational and clinical expertise, attempted to discover vulnerabilities -- realistic clinical prompts for which a large language model (LLM) outputs a response that could cause clinical harm. Red-teaming with clinicians enables the identification of LLM vulnerabilities that may not be recognised by LLM developers lacking clinical expertise. We report the vulnerabilities found, categorise them, and present the results of a replication study assessing the vulnerabilities across all LLMs provided.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are increasingly recognized for their biological plausibility and energy efficiency, positioning them as strong alternatives to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in neuromorphic computing applications. SNNs inherently process temporal information by leveraging the precise timing of spikes, but balancing temporal feature utilization with low energy consumption remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce Temporal Shift module for Spiking Neural Networks (TS-SNN), which incorporates a novel Temporal Shift (TS) module to integrate past, present, and future spike features within a single timestep via a simple yet effective shift operation. A residual combination method prevents information loss by integrating shifted and original features. The TS module is lightweight, requiring only one additional learnable parameter, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing architectures with minimal additional computational cost. TS-SNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like CIFAR-10 (96.72\%), CIFAR-100 (80.28\%), and ImageNet (70.61\%) with fewer timesteps, while maintaining low energy consumption. This work marks a significant step forward in developing efficient and accurate SNN architectures.

<title>Balancing Progress and Safety: A Novel Risk-Aware Objective for RL in Autonomous Driving</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a promising approach for achieving autonomous driving due to robust decision-making capabilities. RL learns a driving policy through trial and error in traffic scenarios, guided by a reward function that combines the driving objectives. The design of such reward function has received insufficient attention, yielding ill-defined rewards with various pitfalls. Safety, in particular, has long been regarded only as a penalty for collisions. This leaves the risks associated with actions leading up to a collision unaddressed, limiting the applicability of RL in real-world scenarios. To address these shortcomings, our work focuses on enhancing the reward formulation by defining a set of driving objectives and structuring them hierarchically. Furthermore, we discuss the formulation of these objectives in a normalized manner to transparently determine their contribution to the overall reward. Additionally, we introduce a novel risk-aware objective for various driving interactions based on a two-dimensional ellipsoid function and an extension of Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) concepts. We evaluate the efficacy of our proposed reward in unsignalized intersection scenarios with varying traffic densities. The approach decreases collision rates by 21\% on average compared to baseline rewards and consistently surpasses them in route progress and cumulative reward, demonstrating its capability to promote safer driving behaviors while maintaining high-performance levels.

<title>Boundary-Guided Trajectory Prediction for Road Aware and Physically Feasible Autonomous Driving</title>

Abstract: Accurate prediction of surrounding road users' trajectories is essential for safe and efficient autonomous driving. While deep learning models have improved performance, challenges remain in preventing off-road predictions and ensuring kinematic feasibility. Existing methods incorporate road-awareness modules and enforce kinematic constraints but lack plausibility guarantees and often introduce trade-offs in complexity and flexibility. This paper proposes a novel framework that formulates trajectory prediction as a constrained regression guided by permissible driving directions and their boundaries. Using the agent's current state and an HD map, our approach defines the valid boundaries and ensures on-road predictions by training the network to learn superimposed paths between left and right boundary polylines. To guarantee feasibility, the model predicts acceleration profiles that determine the vehicle's travel distance along these paths while adhering to kinematic constraints. We evaluate our approach on the Argoverse-2 dataset against the HPTR baseline. Our approach shows a slight decrease in benchmark metrics compared to HPTR but notably improves final displacement error and eliminates infeasible trajectories. Moreover, the proposed approach has superior generalization to less prevalent maneuvers and unseen out-of-distribution scenarios, reducing the off-road rate under adversarial attacks from 66% to just 1%. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in generating feasible and robust predictions.

<title>TPK: Trustworthy Trajectory Prediction Integrating Prior Knowledge For Interpretability and Kinematic Feasibility</title>

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, enabling vehicles to navigate safely by anticipating the movements of surrounding road users. However, current deep learning models often lack trustworthiness as their predictions can be physically infeasible and illogical to humans. To make predictions more trustworthy, recent research has incorporated prior knowledge, like the social force model for modeling interactions and kinematic models for physical realism. However, these approaches focus on priors that suit either vehicles or pedestrians and do not generalize to traffic with mixed agent classes. We propose incorporating interaction and kinematic priors of all agent classes--vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists with class-specific interaction layers to capture agent behavioral differences. To improve the interpretability of the agent interactions, we introduce DG-SFM, a rule-based interaction importance score that guides the interaction layer. To ensure physically feasible predictions, we proposed suitable kinematic models for all agent classes with a novel pedestrian kinematic model. We benchmark our approach on the Argoverse 2 dataset, using the state-of-the-art transformer HPTR as our baseline. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves interaction interpretability, revealing a correlation between incorrect predictions and divergence from our interaction prior. Even though incorporating the kinematic models causes a slight decrease in accuracy, they eliminate infeasible trajectories found in the dataset and the baseline model. Thus, our approach fosters trust in trajectory prediction as its interaction reasoning is interpretable, and its predictions adhere to physics.

<title>Automatic Curriculum Learning for Driving Scenarios: Towards Robust and Efficient Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of training end-to-end autonomous driving agents using Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL agents are typically trained in a fixed set of scenarios and nominal behavior of surrounding road users in simulations, limiting their generalization and real-life deployment. While domain randomization offers a potential solution by randomly sampling driving scenarios, it frequently results in inefficient training and sub-optimal policies due to the high variance among training scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose an automatic curriculum learning framework that dynamically generates driving scenarios with adaptive complexity based on the agent's evolving capabilities. Unlike manually designed curricula that introduce expert bias and lack scalability, our framework incorporates a ``teacher'' that automatically generates and mutates driving scenarios based on their learning potential -- an agent-centric metric derived from the agent's current policy -- eliminating the need for expert design. The framework enhances training efficiency by excluding scenarios the agent has mastered or finds too challenging. We evaluate our framework in a reinforcement learning setting where the agent learns a driving policy from camera images. Comparative results against baseline methods, including fixed scenario training and domain randomization, demonstrate that our approach leads to enhanced generalization, achieving higher success rates: +9% in low traffic density, +21% in high traffic density, and faster convergence with fewer training steps. Our findings highlight the potential of ACL in improving the robustness and efficiency of RL-based autonomous driving agents.

Abstract: In the creative practice of text-to-image generation (TTI), images are generated from text prompts. However, TTI models are trained to always yield an output, even if the prompt contains unknown terms. In this case, the model may generate what we call "default images": images that closely resemble each other across many unrelated prompts. We argue studying default images is valuable for designing better solutions for TTI and prompt engineering. In this paper, we provide the first investigation into default images on Midjourney, a popular image generator. We describe our systematic approach to create input prompts triggering default images, and present the results of our initial experiments and several small-scale ablation studies. We also report on a survey study investigating how default images affect user satisfaction. Our work lays the foundation for understanding default images in TTI and highlights challenges and future research directions.

Abstract: This study presents a deep learning-based framework for predicting emergency department (ED) boarding counts six hours in advance using only operational and contextual data, without patient-level information. Data from ED tracking systems, inpatient census, weather, holidays, and local events were aggregated hourly and processed with comprehensive feature engineering. The mean ED boarding count was 28.7 (standard deviation = 11.2). Multiple deep learning models, including ResNetPlus, TSTPlus, and TSiTPlus, were trained and optimized using Optuna, with TSTPlus achieving the best results (mean absolute error = 4.30, mean squared error = 29.47, R2 = 0.79). The framework accurately forecasted boarding counts, including during extreme periods, and demonstrated that broader input features improve predictive accuracy. This approach supports proactive hospital management and offers a practical method for mitigating ED overcrowding.

Abstract: A multi-agent AI system (MAS) is composed of multiple autonomous agents that interact, exchange information, and make decisions based on internal generative models. Recent advances in large language models and tool-using agents have made MAS increasingly practical in areas like scientific discovery and collaborative automation. However, key questions remain: When are MAS more effective than single-agent systems? What new safety risks arise from agent interactions? And how should we evaluate their reliability and structure? This paper outlines a formal framework for analyzing MAS, focusing on two core aspects: effectiveness and safety. We explore whether MAS truly improve robustness, adaptability, and performance, or merely repackage known techniques like ensemble learning. We also study how inter-agent dynamics may amplify or suppress system vulnerabilities. While MAS are relatively new to the signal processing community, we envision them as a powerful abstraction that extends classical tools like distributed estimation and sensor fusion to higher-level, policy-driven inference. Through experiments on data science automation, we highlight the potential of MAS to reshape how signal processing systems are designed and trusted.

arXiv:2506.05718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grokking refers to a delayed generalization following overfitting when optimizing artificial neural networks with gradient-based methods. In this work, we demonstrate that grokking can be induced by regularization, either explicit or implicit. More precisely, we show that when there exists a model with a property $P$ (e.g., sparse or low-rank weights) that generalizes on the problem of interest, gradient descent with a small but non-zero regularization of $P$ (e.g., $\ell_1$ or nuclear norm regularization) results in grokking. This extends previous work showing that small non-zero weight decay induces grokking. Moreover, our analysis shows that over-parameterization by adding depth makes it possible to grok or ungrok without explicitly using regularization, which is impossible in shallow cases. We further show that the $\ell_2$ norm is not a reliable proxy for generalization when the model is regularized toward a different property $P$, as the $\ell_2$ norm grows in many cases where no weight decay is used, but the model generalizes anyway. We also show that grokking can be amplified solely through data selection, with any other hyperparameter fixed.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a multi-robot system that integrates mapping, localization, and task and motion planning (TAMP) enabled by 3D scene graphs to execute complex instructions expressed in natural language. Our system builds a shared 3D scene graph incorporating an open-set object-based map, which is leveraged for multi-robot 3D scene graph fusion. This representation supports real-time, view-invariant relocalization (via the object-based map) and planning (via the 3D scene graph), allowing a team of robots to reason about their surroundings and execute complex tasks. Additionally, we introduce a planning approach that translates operator intent into Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) goals using a Large Language Model (LLM) by leveraging context from the shared 3D scene graph and robot capabilities. We provide an experimental assessment of the performance of our system on real-world tasks in large-scale, outdoor environments. A supplementary video is available at https://youtu.be/8xbGGOLfLAY.

Abstract: The emerging Internet of AI Agents challenges existing web infrastructure designed for human-scale, reactive interactions. Unlike traditional web resources, autonomous AI agents initiate actions, maintain persistent state, spawn sub-agents, and negotiate directly with peers: demanding millisecond-level discovery, instant credential revocation, and cryptographic behavioral proofs that exceed current DNS/PKI capabilities. This paper analyzes whether to upgrade existing infrastructure or implement purpose-built index architectures for autonomous agents. We identify critical failure points: DNS propagation (24-48 hours vs. required milliseconds), certificate revocation unable to scale to trillions of entities, and IPv4/IPv6 addressing inadequate for agent-scale routing. We evaluate three approaches: (1) Upgrade paths, (2) Switch options, (3) Hybrid index/registries. Drawing parallels to dialup-to-broadband transitions, we find that agent requirements constitute qualitative, and not incremental, changes. While upgrades offer compatibility and faster deployment, clean-slate solutions provide better performance but require longer for adoption. Our analysis suggests hybrid approaches will emerge, with centralized indexes for critical agents and federated meshes for specialized use cases.

arXiv:2506.20893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce an output-reweighting unlearning method, RWFT, a lightweight technique that erases an entire class from a trained classifier without full retraining. Forgetting specific classes from trained models is essential for enforcing user deletion rights and mitigating harmful or biased predictions. The full retraining is costly and existing unlearning methods fail to replicate the behavior of the retrained models when predicting samples from the unlearned class. We prove this failure by designing a variant of membership inference attacks, MIA-NN that successfully reveals the unlearned class for any of these methods. We propose a simple redistribution of the probability mass for the prediction on the samples in the forgotten class which is robust to MIA-NN. We also introduce a new metric based on the total variation (TV) distance of the prediction probabilities to quantify residual leakage to prevent future methods from susceptibility to the new attack. Through extensive experiments with state of the art baselines in machine unlearning, we show that our approach matches the results of full retraining in both metrics used for evaluation by prior work and the new metric we propose in this work. Compare to state-of-the-art methods, we gain 2.79% in previously used metrics and 111.45% in our new TV-based metric over the best existing method.

Abstract: The visible light reflectance data from geostationary satellites is crucial for meteorological observations and plays an important role in weather monitoring and forecasting. However, due to the lack of visible light at night, it is impossible to conduct continuous all-day weather observations using visible light reflectance data. This study pioneers the use of generative diffusion models to address this limitation. Based on the multi-band thermal infrared brightness temperature data from the Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) onboard the Fengyun-4B (FY4B) geostationary satellite, we developed a high-precision visible light reflectance generative model, called Reflectance Diffusion (RefDiff), which enables 0.47~\mu\mathrm{m}, 0.65~\mu\mathrm{m}, and 0.825~\mu\mathrm{m} bands visible light reflectance generation at night. Compared to the classical models, RefDiff not only significantly improves accuracy through ensemble averaging but also provides uncertainty estimation. Specifically, the SSIM index of RefDiff can reach 0.90, with particularly significant improvements in areas with complex cloud structures and thick clouds. The model's nighttime generation capability was validated using VIIRS nighttime product, demonstrating comparable performance to its daytime counterpart. In summary, this research has made substantial progress in the ability to generate visible light reflectance at night, with the potential to expand the application of nighttime visible light data.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been proven to be highly effective in handling complex control tasks. Traditional methods typically use unimodal distributions, such as Gaussian distributions, to model the output of value distributions. However, unimodal distribution often and easily causes bias in value function estimation, leading to poor algorithm performance. This paper proposes a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm called DSAC-D (Distributed Soft Actor Critic with Diffusion Policy) to address the challenges of estimating bias in value functions and obtaining multimodal policy representations. A multimodal distributional policy iteration framework that can converge to the optimal policy was established by introducing policy entropy and value distribution function. A diffusion value network that can accurately characterize the distribution of multi peaks was constructed by generating a set of reward samples through reverse sampling using a diffusion model. Based on this, a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm with dual diffusion of the value network and the policy network was derived. MuJoCo testing tasks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only learns multimodal policy, but also achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in all 9 control tasks, with significant suppression of estimation bias and total average return improvement of over 10% compared to existing mainstream algorithms. The results of real vehicle testing show that DSAC-D can accurately characterize the multimodal distribution of different driving styles, and the diffusion policy network can characterize multimodal trajectories.

Abstract: Vanilla autoregressive image generation models generate visual tokens step-by-step, limiting their ability to capture holistic relationships among token sequences. Moreover, because most visual tokenizers map local image patches into latent tokens, global information is limited. To address this, we introduce \textit{Hita}, a novel image tokenizer for autoregressive (AR) image generation. It introduces a holistic-to-local tokenization scheme with learnable holistic queries and local patch tokens. Hita incorporates two key strategies to better align with the AR generation process: 1) {arranging} a sequential structure with holistic tokens at the beginning, followed by patch-level tokens, and using causal attention to maintain awareness of previous tokens; and 2) adopting a lightweight fusion module before feeding the de-quantized tokens into the decoder to control information flow and prioritize holistic tokens. Extensive experiments show that Hita accelerates the training speed of AR generators and outperforms those trained with vanilla tokenizers, achieving \textbf{2.59 FID} and \textbf{281.9 IS} on the ImageNet benchmark. Detailed analysis of the holistic representation highlights its ability to capture global image properties, such as textures, materials, and shapes. Additionally, Hita also demonstrates effectiveness in zero-shot style transfer and image in-painting. The code is available at \href{https://github.com/CVMI-Lab/Hita}{https://github.com/CVMI-Lab/Hita}.

Abstract: The primary objective of human activity recognition (HAR) is to infer ongoing human actions from sensor data, a task that finds broad applications in health monitoring, safety protection, and sports analysis. Despite proliferating research, HAR still faces key challenges, including the scarcity of labeled samples for rare activities, insufficient extraction of high-level features, and suboptimal model performance on lightweight devices. To address these issues, this paper proposes a comprehensive optimization approach centered on multi-attention interaction mechanisms. First, an unsupervised, statistics-guided diffusion model is employed to perform data augmentation, thereby alleviating the problems of labeled data scarcity and severe class imbalance. Second, a multi-branch spatio-temporal interaction network is designed, which captures multi-scale features of sequential data through parallel residual branches with 3*3, 5*5, and 7*7 convolutional kernels. Simultaneously, temporal attention mechanisms are incorporated to identify critical time points, while spatial attention enhances inter-sensor interactions. A cross-branch feature fusion unit is further introduced to improve the overall feature representation capability. Finally, an adaptive multi-loss function fusion strategy is integrated, allowing for dynamic adjustment of loss weights and overall model optimization. Experimental results on three public datasets, WISDM, PAMAP2, and OPPORTUNITY, demonstrate that the proposed unsupervised data augmentation spatio-temporal attention diffusion network (USAD) achieves accuracies of 98.84%, 93.81%, and 80.92% respectively, significantly outperforming existing approaches. Furthermore, practical deployment on embedded devices verifies the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed method.

<div> Keywords: CVS recognition, multi-modal model, adaptation strategy, textual prompts, surgical tasks <br />
Summary: <br />
The study focuses on automating the recognition of Critical View of Safety (CVS) criteria in laparoscopic cholecystectomy using text as a powerful tool in multi-modal surgical foundation models. Existing models for CVS recognition rely on labor-intensive spatial annotations for vision-only models, making the task complex. The proposed CVS-AdaptNet utilizes a multi-label adaptation strategy to improve fine-grained binary classification across multiple labels by aligning image embeddings with textual descriptions. It outperforms the image-only baseline and achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 57.6 on the Endoscapes-CVS201 dataset. The multi-label, multi-modal framework, enhanced by textual prompts, proves beneficial for CVS recognition. Text-specific inference methods are also proposed for analyzing image-text alignment. The study showcases the potential of adapting generalist models to specialized surgical tasks, although further research is needed to match spatial annotation-based methods. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: The Critical View of Safety (CVS) is crucial for safe laparoscopic cholecystectomy, yet assessing CVS criteria remains a complex and challenging task, even for experts. Traditional models for CVS recognition depend on vision-only models learning with costly, labor-intensive spatial annotations. This study investigates how text can be harnessed as a powerful tool for both training and inference in multi-modal surgical foundation models to automate CVS recognition. Unlike many existing multi-modal models, which are primarily adapted for multi-class classification, CVS recognition requires a multi-label framework. Zero-shot evaluation of existing multi-modal surgical models shows a significant performance gap for this task. To address this, we propose CVS-AdaptNet, a multi-label adaptation strategy that enhances fine-grained, binary classification across multiple labels by aligning image embeddings with textual descriptions of each CVS criterion using positive and negative prompts. By adapting PeskaVLP, a state-of-the-art surgical foundation model, on the Endoscapes-CVS201 dataset, CVS-AdaptNet achieves 57.6 mAP, improving over the ResNet50 image-only baseline (51.5 mAP) by 6 points. Our results show that CVS-AdaptNet's multi-label, multi-modal framework, enhanced by textual prompts, boosts CVS recognition over image-only methods. We also propose text-specific inference methods, that helps in analysing the image-text alignment. While further work is needed to match state-of-the-art spatial annotation-based methods, this approach highlights the potential of adapting generalist models to specialized surgical tasks.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces MML-SurgAdapt, a multi-task framework for surgical AI using Vision-Language Models like CLIP. It addresses the challenge of handling multiple surgical tasks within a single procedure by using Single Positive Multi-Label (SPML) learning to integrate data effectively.

Abstract: Surgical AI often involves multiple tasks within a single procedure, like phase recognition or assessing the Critical View of Safety in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Traditional models, built for one task at a time, lack flexibility, requiring a separate model for each. To address this, we introduce MML-SurgAdapt, a unified multi-task framework with Vision-Language Models (VLMs), specifically CLIP, to handle diverse surgical tasks through natural language supervision. A key challenge in multi-task learning is the presence of partial annotations when integrating different tasks. To overcome this, we employ Single Positive Multi-Label (SPML) learning, which traditionally reduces annotation burden by training models with only one positive label per instance. Our framework extends this approach to integrate data from multiple surgical tasks within a single procedure, enabling effective learning despite incomplete or noisy annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a combined dataset consisting of Cholec80, Endoscapes2023, and CholecT50, utilizing custom prompts. Extensive evaluation shows that MML-SurgAdapt performs comparably to task-specific benchmarks, with the added advantage of handling noisy annotations. It also outperforms the existing SPML frameworks for the task. By reducing the required labels by 23%, our approach proposes a more scalable and efficient labeling process, significantly easing the annotation burden on clinicians. To our knowledge, this is the first application of SPML to integrate data from multiple surgical tasks, presenting a novel and generalizable solution for multi-task learning in surgical computer vision.

<div> framework, large language models, fault-recovery planning, process control, automation

Summary:
The article presents a unified agentic framework that combines large language models (LLMs) with Finite State Machines (FSMs) for fault-recovery planning and process control in chemical engineering. The framework utilizes LLMs to propose recovery sequences through the FSM and employs a Simulation Agent and Validator-Reprompting loop for plan execution and refinement. In Case Study 1, the framework achieves 100% valid-path success across various FSM sizes, outperforming existing LLMs in accuracy and latency. In Case Study 2, the framework successfully modulates dual-heater inputs to maintain a target temperature on a laboratory platform. Comparing to classical PID control, the LLM-based controller shows similar performance, highlighting the prompting loop's importance in handling nonlinear dynamics. The study also analyzes failure modes, such as instruction lapses and ODE approximations, showcasing the potential of structured feedback and modular agents in language-driven automation for chemical processes. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern chemical processes, coupled with workforce shortages and intricate fault scenarios, demands novel automation paradigms that blend symbolic reasoning with adaptive control. In this work, we introduce a unified agentic framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for both discrete fault-recovery planning and continuous process control within a single architecture. We adopt Finite State Machines (FSMs) as interpretable operating envelopes: an LLM-driven planning agent proposes recovery sequences through the FSM, a Simulation Agent executes and checks each transition, and a Validator-Reprompting loop iteratively refines invalid plans. In Case Study 1, across 180 randomly generated FSMs of varying sizes (4-25 states, 4-300 transitions), GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini achieve 100% valid-path success within five reprompts-outperforming open-source LLMs in both accuracy and latency. In Case Study 2, the same framework modulates dual-heater inputs on a laboratory TCLab platform (and its digital twin) to maintain a target average temperature under persistent asymmetric disturbances. Compared to classical PID control, our LLM-based controller attains similar performance, while ablation of the prompting loop reveals its critical role in handling nonlinear dynamics. We analyze key failure modes-such as instruction following lapses and coarse ODE approximations. Our results demonstrate that, with structured feedback and modular agents, LLMs can unify high-level symbolic planningand low-level continuous control, paving the way towards resilient, language-driven automation in chemical engineering.

<div> painting classification, bias in AI, bias mitigation, BOOST method, fairness

Summary: 
The article discusses the pervasive issue of bias in AI and its impact on painting classification. It emphasizes the need for addressing biases in models dealing with out-of-distribution (OOD) data. The proposed BOOST (Bias-Oriented OOD Sampling and Tuning) method aims to mitigate biases by adjusting temperature scaling and sampling probabilities to achieve a more equitable representation of all classes. The evaluation on KaoKore and PACS datasets focuses on reducing class-wise bias, with the introduction of the Same-Dataset OOD Detection Score (SODC) metric to measure class-wise separation and bias reduction. The method successfully balances high performance with fairness, offering a robust solution for unbiasing AI models in the art domain. <div>

Abstract: The pervasive issue of bias in AI presents a significant challenge to painting classification, and is getting more serious as these systems become increasingly integrated into tasks like art curation and restoration. Biases, often arising from imbalanced datasets where certain artistic styles dominate, compromise the fairness and accuracy of model predictions, i.e., classifiers are less accurate on rarely seen paintings. While prior research has made strides in improving classification performance, it has largely overlooked the critical need to address these underlying biases, that is, when dealing with out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our insight highlights the necessity of a more robust approach to bias mitigation in AI models for art classification on biased training data. We propose a novel OOD-informed model bias adaptive sampling method called BOOST (Bias-Oriented OOD Sampling and Tuning). It addresses these challenges by dynamically adjusting temperature scaling and sampling probabilities, thereby promoting a more equitable representation of all classes. We evaluate our proposed approach to the KaoKore and PACS datasets, focusing on the model's ability to reduce class-wise bias. We further propose a new metric, Same-Dataset OOD Detection Score (SODC), designed to assess class-wise separation and per-class bias reduction. Our method demonstrates the ability to balance high performance with fairness, making it a robust solution for unbiasing AI models in the art domain.

Summary: 
- Supply chain networks are complex systems that are difficult to analyze, especially when illicit activities such as counterfeit parts or forced labor are involved.
- Traditional machine learning techniques struggle with sparse and corrupted data typical of illicit supply chains.
- Neurosymbolic methods are explored as a solution to automatically detect patterns of illegal activity in supply chains without large training data sets.

Abstract: Supply chain networks are complex systems that are challenging to analyze; this problem is exacerbated when there are illicit activities involved in the supply chain, such as counterfeit parts, forced labor, or human trafficking. While machine learning (ML) can find patterns in complex systems like supply chains, traditional ML techniques require large training data sets. However, illicit supply chains are characterized by very sparse data, and the data that is available is often (purposely) corrupted or unreliable in order to hide the nature of the activities. We need to be able to automatically detect new patterns that correlate with such illegal activity over complex, even temporal data, without requiring large training data sets. We explore neurosymbolic methods for identifying instances of illicit activity in supply chains and compare the effectiveness of manual and automated feature extraction from news articles accurately describing illicit activities uncovered by authorities. We propose a question tree approach for querying a large language model (LLM) to identify and quantify the relevance of articles. This enables a systematic evaluation of the differences between human and machine classification of news articles related to forced labor in supply chains.

Abstract: We present a multi-agent system for automation of scientific research tasks, cmbagent. The system is formed by about 30 Large Language Model (LLM) agents and implements a Planning & Control strategy to orchestrate the agentic workflow, with no human-in-the-loop at any point. Each agent specializes in a different task (performing retrieval on scientific papers and codebases, writing code, interpreting results, critiquing the output of other agents) and the system is able to execute code locally. We successfully apply cmbagent to carry out a PhD level cosmology task (the measurement of cosmological parameters using supernova data) and evaluate its performance on two benchmark sets, finding superior performance over state-of-the-art LLMs. The source code is available on GitHub, demonstration videos are also available, and the system is deployed on HuggingFace and will be available on the cloud.

Abstract: LLM-based translation agents have achieved highly human-like translation results and are capable of handling longer and more complex contexts with greater efficiency. However, they are typically limited to text-only inputs. In this paper, we introduce ViDove, a translation agent system designed for multimodal input. Inspired by the workflow of human translators, ViDove leverages visual and contextual background information to enhance the translation process. Additionally, we integrate a multimodal memory system and long-short term memory modules enriched with domain-specific knowledge, enabling the agent to perform more accurately and adaptively in real-world scenarios. As a result, ViDove achieves significantly higher translation quality in both subtitle generation and general translation tasks, with a 28% improvement in BLEU scores and a 15% improvement in SubER compared to previous state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, we introduce DoveBench, a new benchmark for long-form automatic video subtitling and translation, featuring 17 hours of high-quality, human-annotated data.

<div> alignment challenge, large language models (LLMs), filters, unsafe information, computational challenges 

Summary: 
Filters play a crucial role in preventing the generation of harmful content by large language models (LLMs). The study focuses on two key points of intervention: filtering input prompts before model processing and output filtering after generation. However, it was found that there are computational challenges in implementing efficient filters for both prompts and outputs. Adversarial prompts can be constructed to elicit harmful behavior, making prompt filtering inefficient. Additionally, in certain scenarios, output filtering becomes computationally intractable. This study highlights the limitations of external filters in ensuring safety in LLMs, emphasizing that intelligence and judgment in an aligned AI system cannot be separated. The results suggest that effective safety measures require an intrinsic alignment of an AI system's architecture and weights with ethical considerations. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.07341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increased deployment of large language models (LLMs), one concern is their potential misuse for generating harmful content. Our work studies the alignment challenge, with a focus on filters to prevent the generation of unsafe information. Two natural points of intervention are the filtering of the input prompt before it reaches the model, and filtering the output after generation. Our main results demonstrate computational challenges in filtering both prompts and outputs. First, we show that there exist LLMs for which there are no efficient prompt filters: adversarial prompts that elicit harmful behavior can be easily constructed, which are computationally indistinguishable from benign prompts for any efficient filter. Our second main result identifies a natural setting in which output filtering is computationally intractable. All of our separation results are under cryptographic hardness assumptions. In addition to these core findings, we also formalize and study relaxed mitigation approaches, demonstrating further computational barriers. We conclude that safety cannot be achieved by designing filters external to the LLM internals (architecture and weights); in particular, black-box access to the LLM will not suffice. Based on our technical results, we argue that an aligned AI system's intelligence cannot be separated from its judgment.

Abstract: High responsiveness and economic efficiency are critical objectives in supply chain transportation, both of which are influenced by strategic decisions on shipping mode. An integrated framework combining an efficient simulator with an intelligent decision-making algorithm can provide an observable, low-risk environment for transportation strategy design. An ideal simulation-decision framework must (1) generalize effectively across various settings, (2) reflect fine-grained transportation dynamics, (3) integrate historical experience with predictive insights, and (4) maintain tight integration between simulation feedback and policy refinement. We propose Sim-to-Dec framework to satisfy these requirements. Specifically, Sim-to-Dec consists of a generative simulation module, which leverages autoregressive modeling to simulate continuous state changes, reducing dependence on handcrafted domain-specific rules and enhancing robustness against data fluctuations; and a history-future dual-aware decision model, refined iteratively through end-to-end optimization with simulator interactions. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate that Sim-to-Dec significantly improves timely delivery rates and profit.

arXiv:2507.07426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated considerable potential in scientific domains such as drug discovery. However, their effectiveness remains constrained when reasoning extends beyond the knowledge acquired during pretraining. Conventional approaches, such as fine-tuning or retrieval-augmented generation, face limitations in either imposing high computational overhead or failing to fully exploit structured scientific data. To overcome these challenges, we propose DrugMCTS, a novel framework that synergistically integrates RAG, multi-agent collaboration, and Monte Carlo Tree Search for drug repurposing. The framework employs five specialized agents tasked with retrieving and analyzing molecular and protein information, thereby enabling structured and iterative reasoning. Without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning, DrugMCTS empowers Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct to outperform Deepseek-R1 by over 20\%. Extensive experiments on the DrugBank and KIBA datasets demonstrate that DrugMCTS achieves substantially higher recall and robustness compared to both general-purpose LLMs and deep learning baselines. Our results highlight the importance of structured reasoning, agent-based collaboration, and feedback-driven search mechanisms in advancing LLM applications for drug discovery.

Summary:
StarDojo is a new benchmark designed to evaluate AI agents in open-ended production-living simulations by combining production activities with social interactions. It consists of 1,000 tasks across farming, crafting, exploration, combat, and social interactions, with a subset of 100 tasks for model evaluation. The benchmark provides a user-friendly interface supporting all major operating systems and enables parallel execution of multiple environment instances. State-of-the-art multimodal large language models (MLLMs) agents struggle in StarDojo, with the best model, GPT-4.1, achieving only a 12.7% success rate due to challenges in visual understanding, multimodal reasoning, and low-level manipulation. StarDojo aims to facilitate research towards developing robust, open-ended agents in complex production-living environments.

Abstract: Autonomous agents navigating human society must master both production activities and social interactions, yet existing benchmarks rarely evaluate these skills simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we introduce StarDojo, a novel benchmark based on Stardew Valley, designed to assess AI agents in open-ended production-living simulations. In StarDojo, agents are tasked to perform essential livelihood activities such as farming and crafting, while simultaneously engaging in social interactions to establish relationships within a vibrant community. StarDojo features 1,000 meticulously curated tasks across five key domains: farming, crafting, exploration, combat, and social interactions. Additionally, we provide a compact subset of 100 representative tasks for efficient model evaluation. The benchmark offers a unified, user-friendly interface that eliminates the need for keyboard and mouse control, supports all major operating systems, and enables the parallel execution of multiple environment instances, making it particularly well-suited for evaluating the most capable foundation agents, powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs agents demonstrate substantial limitations, with the best-performing model, GPT-4.1, achieving only a 12.7% success rate, primarily due to challenges in visual understanding, multimodal reasoning and low-level manipulation. As a user-friendly environment and benchmark, StarDojo aims to facilitate further research towards robust, open-ended agents in complex production-living environments.

<div> Framework, Algorithms, LLMs, Task-specific problems, Methodological paths
Summary:
This paper introduces AlgEval, a framework for investigating the algorithms that Large Language Models (LLMs) learn and use to solve problems. The focus is on uncovering algorithmic primitives and their composition in solving task-specific problems. The proposed methodology includes identifying latent representations, attention mechanisms, and inference-time compute to understand how LLMs solve tasks. The case study presented focuses on emergent search algorithms and highlights the importance of forming hypotheses and testing them through circuit-level analysis of attention patterns and hidden states. This systematic evaluation aims to provide insights into the underlying computations of LLMs, offering a pathway to human-understandable interpretability, improved performance, and more sample-efficient training methods. Overall, the paper advocates for a shift towards understanding the algorithms employed by LLMs, rather than solely focusing on scaling up model sizes.

Abstract: What algorithms do LLMs actually learn and use to solve problems? Studies addressing this question are sparse, as research priorities are focused on improving performance through scale, leaving a theoretical and empirical gap in understanding emergent algorithms. This position paper proposes AlgEval: a framework for systematic research into the algorithms that LLMs learn and use. AlgEval aims to uncover algorithmic primitives, reflected in latent representations, attention, and inference-time compute, and their algorithmic composition to solve task-specific problems. We highlight potential methodological paths and a case study toward this goal, focusing on emergent search algorithms. Our case study illustrates both the formation of top-down hypotheses about candidate algorithms, and bottom-up tests of these hypotheses via circuit-level analysis of attention patterns and hidden states. The rigorous, systematic evaluation of how LLMs actually solve tasks provides an alternative to resource-intensive scaling, reorienting the field toward a principled understanding of underlying computations. Such algorithmic explanations offer a pathway to human-understandable interpretability, enabling comprehension of the model's internal reasoning performance measures. This can in turn lead to more sample-efficient methods for training and improving performance, as well as novel architectures for end-to-end and multi-agent systems.

<div> Keywords: machine learning, explanations, interpretability, rule-based models, undesired facets

Summary:
This article discusses the importance of providing explanations for predictions made by machine learning models, particularly in high-risk domains where incorrect explanations can have serious consequences. It emphasizes the use of interpretable models, specifically rule-based models such as decision trees, in such scenarios. The paper explores the negative aspects of rule-based models, including negative overlap and redundancy, which can impact the accuracy and reliability of explanations. Algorithms are proposed for analyzing and addressing these undesired facets of rule-based systems. The study highlights that commonly used tools for creating rule-based machine learning models may inadvertently introduce these negative aspects, underscoring the need for further research and development in interpretable machine learning models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.07576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A task of interest in machine learning (ML) is that of ascribing explanations to the predictions made by ML models. Furthermore, in domains deemed high risk, the rigor of explanations is paramount. Indeed, incorrect explanations can and will mislead human decision makers. As a result, and even if interpretability is acknowledged as an elusive concept, so-called interpretable models are employed ubiquitously in high-risk uses of ML and data mining (DM). This is the case for rule-based ML models, which encompass decision trees, diagrams, sets and lists. This paper relates explanations with well-known undesired facets of rule-based ML models, which include negative overlap and several forms of redundancy. The paper develops algorithms for the analysis of these undesired facets of rule-based systems, and concludes that well-known and widely used tools for learning rule-based ML models will induce rule sets that exhibit one or more negative facets.

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel method called Context Pooling to enhance Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based models for link prediction in Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Context Pooling is the first to apply graph pooling in KGs and allows for the generation of query-specific graphs for inductive settings. The method uses metrics like neighborhood precision and neighborhood recall to assess logical relevance of neighbors for link prediction. The generic approach is evaluated on two state-of-the-art models across three public datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance in 42 out of 48 settings.

arXiv:2507.07595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent investigations on the effectiveness of Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based models for link prediction in Knowledge Graphs (KGs) show that vanilla aggregation does not significantly impact the model performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, named Context Pooling, to enhance GNN-based models' efficacy for link predictions in KGs. To our best of knowledge, Context Pooling is the first methodology that applies graph pooling in KGs. Additionally, Context Pooling is first-of-its-kind to enable the generation of query-specific graphs for inductive settings, where testing entities are unseen during training. Specifically, we devise two metrics, namely neighborhood precision and neighborhood recall, to assess the neighbors' logical relevance regarding the given queries, thereby enabling the subsequent comprehensive identification of only the logically relevant neighbors for link prediction. Our method is generic and assessed by being applied to two state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on three public transductive and inductive datasets, achieving SOTA performance in 42 out of 48 settings.

Summary:
PlanQA introduces a diagnostic benchmark to evaluate geometric and spatial reasoning in large-language models (LLMs). It is based on structured representations of indoor scenes and includes diverse question types testing metric, topological reasoning, and interior design constraints. Results show that current LLMs succeed in basic queries but struggle with simulating physical constraints, spatial coherence, and generalizing under layout changes. The benchmark highlights a gap in LLMs' ability to reason about real-world layouts accurately. PlanQA aims to inspire research on language models that can effectively infer and manipulate spatial and geometric properties in practical settings. <div>

Abstract: We introduce PlanQA, a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating geometric and spatial reasoning in large-language models (LLMs). PlanQA is grounded in structured representations of indoor scenes, such as kitchens, living rooms, and bedrooms, encoded in a symbolic format (e.g., JSON, XML layouts). The benchmark includes diverse question types that test not only metric and topological reasoning (e.g., distance, visibility, shortest paths) but also interior design constraints such as affordance, clearance, balance, and usability. Our results across a variety of frontier open-source and commercial LLMs show that while models may succeed in shallow queries, they often fail to simulate physical constraints, preserve spatial coherence, or generalize under layout perturbation. PlanQA uncovers a clear blind spot in today's LLMs: they do not consistently reason about real-world layouts. We hope that this benchmark inspires new work on language models that can accurately infer and manipulate spatial and geometric properties in practical settings.

<div> Keywords: Direct Preference Optimization, language models, alignment, probability evolution, stable preference optimization <br />
Summary: 
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a popular method for aligning language models with human preferences, but its theoretical properties and limitations are not well understood. A study reveals that DPO is sensitive to initialization and can misallocate probability mass, leading to undesired responses. This misallocation can reinforce model bias and compromise alignment and consistency with preferences. To address these issues, a bilevel optimization framework called stable preference optimization is proposed. This framework integrates supervised fine-tuning with an enhanced DPO objective, introducing a regularization scheme to improve preferred outputs' probabilities while maintaining stable optimization dynamics. Experiments show that stable preference optimization improves reasoning accuracy and aligns output distributions with preferences better than standard DPO. This approach offers insights into preference-based alignment objectives and enhances the reliability and interpretability of language model alignment. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.07723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a popular and efficient alternative to reward modeling and reinforcement learning for aligning language models with human preferences. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical properties and intrinsic limitations of DPO remain underexplored. In this work, we first present a comprehensive analysis of DPO's dynamics from a probability evolution perspective. Our analysis reveals that DPO is highly sensitive to initialization. It also tends to misallocate probability mass, which can inadvertently shift probability toward irrelevant or undesired responses. This misallocation may unintentionally reinforce model bias, thereby compromising both the stability of model alignment and the consistency with intended preferences. Motivated by these theoretical findings, we propose a theoretically grounded bilevel optimization framework that tightly integrate supervised fine-tuning with an enhanced DPO objective a.k.a. stable preference optimization. Our approach introduces a principled regularization scheme to explicitly encourage absolute probability improvement for preferred outputs, while maintaining stable optimization dynamics. Experiments on challenging reasoning and summarization benchmarks elucidate that our method consistently improves reasoning accuracy and better aligns output distributions with intended preferences, outperforming standard DPO. Stable preference optimization provides new insights into the design of preference-based alignment objectives and opens up new avenues towards more reliable and interpretable language model alignment.

<div> Keywords: violins, size reduction, contour lines, classification, geometric meshes

Summary: 
In this study, the authors analyze the impact of size reduction on violins by examining their contour lines. The research focuses on a corpus of 25 instruments, utilizing 3D geometric meshes acquired through photogrammetry. By fitting parabola-like curves to the contour lines and extracting features from the parameters, such as beta and alpha, the study aims to classify violins as either reduced or non-reduced based on their geometry. Classification methods are then employed to predict size reduction, with the opening parameter beta identified as the most predictive feature. The findings suggest that distinguishing between reduced and non-reduced violins is achievable to some extent, although the presence of a spectrum of transformation levels may complicate quantification. This research sheds light on the quantitative analysis of violin size reduction and highlights the importance of geometric features in classification studies. 

Summary: <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.07743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first violins appeared in late 16th-century Italy. Over the next 200 years, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to experiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments. Around 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for orchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were then reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on several characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e. lines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced instruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by experts, they have not been studied quantitatively.
  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or non-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments whose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each instrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre. Each line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y = alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta) and how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional features from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values fall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of levels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.
  We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can predict size reduction. We find that distinguishing between reduced and non reduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a whole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more difficult to quantify the reduction. We also find the opening parameter beta to be the most predictive.

Summary: 
The Flourishing AI Benchmark (FAI Benchmark) introduces a new evaluation framework that assesses AI alignment with human flourishing across seven dimensions. Unlike traditional benchmarks, the FAI Benchmark focuses on how effectively AI systems contribute to a person's well-being. Using judge Large Language Models (LLMs) and a comprehensive methodology with over 1,200 questions, the benchmark evaluates AI performance in areas such as Character and Virtue, Happiness, and Mental Health. Initial testing of 28 language models shows that while some models approach holistic alignment, none are adequately aligned across all dimensions. The research highlights the significance of developing AI systems that actively support human flourishing and offers implications for AI development and ethics.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Flourishing AI Benchmark (FAI Benchmark), a novel evaluation framework that assesses AI alignment with human flourishing across seven dimensions: Character and Virtue, Close Social Relationships, Happiness and Life Satisfaction, Meaning and Purpose, Mental and Physical Health, Financial and Material Stability, and Faith and Spirituality. Unlike traditional benchmarks that focus on technical capabilities or harm prevention, the FAI Benchmark measures AI performance on how effectively models contribute to the flourishing of a person across these dimensions. The benchmark evaluates how effectively LLM AI systems align with current research models of holistic human well-being through a comprehensive methodology that incorporates 1,229 objective and subjective questions. Using specialized judge Large Language Models (LLMs) and cross-dimensional evaluation, the FAI Benchmark employs geometric mean scoring to ensure balanced performance across all flourishing dimensions. Initial testing of 28 leading language models reveals that while some models approach holistic alignment (with the highest-scoring models achieving 72/100), none are acceptably aligned across all dimensions, particularly in Faith and Spirituality, Character and Virtue, and Meaning and Purpose. This research establishes a framework for developing AI systems that actively support human flourishing rather than merely avoiding harm, offering significant implications for AI development, ethics, and evaluation.

The study introduces the MoSE model, a skill-oriented Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) inspired by human drivers' learning process. By defining specific skills and annotating driving competencies, the model facilitates skill-by-skill learning for various scenarios. A hierarchical skill dataset and pretraining the router encourage step-by-step thinking, aligning the driving process with human reasoning. MoSE integrates auxiliary tasks such as description, reasoning, and planning in a single forward process without additional computational cost. With 3B sparsely activated parameters, the model outperforms larger models on corner case reasoning tasks while reducing activated model size by at least 62.5%. This approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-turn conversations compared to existing methods utilizing open-source models and data.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recent studies show large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) trained using web-scale data can empower end-to-end autonomous driving systems for a better generalization and interpretation. Specifically, by dynamically routing inputs to specialized subsets of parameters, the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique enables general LLMs or VLMs to achieve substantial performance improvements while maintaining computational efficiency. However, general MoE models usually demands extensive training data and complex optimization. In this work, inspired by the learning process of human drivers, we propose a skill-oriented MoE, called MoSE, which mimics human drivers' learning process and reasoning process, skill-by-skill and step-by-step. We propose a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with defining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the necessary driving competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks, thereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. Further align the driving process to multi-step planning in human reasoning and end-to-end driving models, we build a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the model to think step-by-step. Unlike multi-round dialogs, MoSE integrates valuable auxiliary tasks (e.g.\ description, reasoning, planning) in one single forward process without introducing any extra computational cost. With less than 3B sparsely activated parameters, our model outperforms several 8B+ parameters on CODA AD corner case reasoning task. Compared to existing methods based on open-source models and data, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced activated model size (at least by $62.5\%$) with a single-turn conversation.

Abstract: Current AI advances largely rely on scaling neural models and expanding training datasets to achieve generalization and robustness. Despite notable successes, this paradigm incurs significant environmental, economic, and ethical costs, limiting sustainability and equitable access. Inspired by biological sensory systems, where adaptation occurs dynamically at the input (e.g., adjusting pupil size, refocusing vision)--we advocate for adaptive sensing as a necessary and foundational shift. Adaptive sensing proactively modulates sensor parameters (e.g., exposure, sensitivity, multimodal configurations) at the input level, significantly mitigating covariate shifts and improving efficiency. Empirical evidence from recent studies demonstrates that adaptive sensing enables small models (e.g., EfficientNet-B0) to surpass substantially larger models (e.g., OpenCLIP-H) trained with significantly more data and compute. We (i) outline a roadmap for broadly integrating adaptive sensing into real-world applications spanning humanoid, healthcare, autonomous systems, agriculture, and environmental monitoring, (ii) critically assess technical and ethical integration challenges, and (iii) propose targeted research directions, such as standardized benchmarks, real-time adaptive algorithms, multimodal integration, and privacy-preserving methods. Collectively, these efforts aim to transition the AI community toward sustainable, robust, and equitable artificial intelligence systems.

- Identifying actual causes is a challenging problem, with limited practical solutions available.<br />

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.07857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causality has gained popularity in recent years. It has helped improve the performance, reliability, and interpretability of machine learning models. However, recent literature on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has faced criticism. The classical XAI and causality literature focuses on understanding which factors contribute to which consequences. While such knowledge is valuable for researchers and engineers, it is not what non-expert users expect as explanations. Instead, these users often await facts that cause the target consequences, i.e., actual causes. Formalizing this notion is still an open problem. Additionally, identifying actual causes is reportedly an NP-complete problem, and there are too few practical solutions to approximate formal definitions. We propose a set of algorithms to identify actual causes with a polynomial complexity and an adjustable level of precision and exhaustiveness. Our experiments indicate that the algorithms (1) identify causes for different categories of systems that are not handled by existing approaches (i.e., non-boolean, black-box, and stochastic systems), (2) can be adjusted to gain more precision and exhaustiveness with more computation time.

Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence has positioned large language models as fundamental components of intelligent legal systems. However, these models face significant limitations in legal dispute analysis, including insufficient legal knowledge representation, limited concept understanding, and reasoning deficiencies. This research proposes an enhanced framework integrating prompt engineering with multidimensional knowledge graphs. The framework introduces a three-stage hierarchical prompt structure comprising task definition, knowledge background, and reasoning guidance, supplemented by legal-specific reasoning templates and dynamic optimization mechanisms. A three-layer knowledge graph architecture is constructed with legal classification ontology, representation, and instance layers. Four complementary methods enable precise legal concept retrieval: direct legal norm code matching, domain-specific semantic vector similarity, ontology-based path reasoning, and specialized lexical segmentation. These components integrate with web search technology to establish a knowledge-enhanced framework for legal decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements in legal dispute analysis, enabling accurate legal application analysis for complex cases while exhibiting nuanced understanding of judicial decision-making logic, providing a novel technical approach for implementing intelligent legal assistance systems.

The article challenges the prevailing belief that the scaling of AI systems by a few companies has led to increasing inequality in model performance. It argues that diminishing returns to compute scaling will eventually lead to a convergence of AI model capabilities. The diminishing returns to raw compute for marginal capability are substantial, suggesting that meek models with limited computation budget will approach the performance level of the best models. The article provides evidence from benchmark data and theoretical performance models to support the idea that even companies with exponential scaling advantages will have little advantage in capabilities in the long run. The shift towards meek models will impact AI strategy and policy, necessitating a reexamination of current approaches in these areas. <div>

Abstract: The past decade has seen incredible scaling of AI systems by a few companies, leading to inequality in AI model performance. This paper argues that, contrary to prevailing intuition, the diminishing returns to compute scaling will lead to a convergence of AI model capabilities. In other words, meek models (those with limited computation budget) shall inherit the earth, approaching the performance level of the best models overall. We develop a model illustrating that under a fixed-distribution next-token objective, the marginal capability returns to raw compute shrink substantially. Given current scaling practices, we argue that these diminishing returns are strong enough that even companies that can scale their models exponentially faster than other organizations will eventually have little advantage in capabilities. As part of our argument, we give several reasons that proxies like training loss differences capture important capability measures using evidence from benchmark data and theoretical performance models. In addition, we analyze empirical data on the capability difference of AI models over time. Finally, in light of the increasing ability of meek models, we argue that AI strategy and policy require reexamination, and we outline the areas this shift will affect.

<div> Keywords: generative AI, work activities, AI applicability, occupations, impact

Summary:
In this study, the impact of generative AI on the economy is examined through an analysis of work activities carried out by individuals with AI assistance. The most common activities include gathering information, writing, teaching, and advising. AI itself is primarily involved in providing information, assistance, writing, and advising tasks. By assessing the success and scope of these activities, an AI applicability score is computed for different occupations, with knowledge work fields like computer and mathematical sciences scoring the highest. Sales and office support occupations also show high AI applicability due to their focus on information provision. The study also explores the correlation between wages, education levels, and AI applicability, as well as comparing real-world AI usage to predicted occupational impacts. <div>

Abstract: Given the rapid adoption of generative AI and its potential to impact a wide range of tasks, understanding the effects of AI on the economy is one of society's most important questions. In this work, we take a step toward that goal by analyzing the work activities people do with AI, how successfully and broadly those activities are done, and combine that with data on what occupations do those activities. We analyze a dataset of 200k anonymized and privacy-scrubbed conversations between users and Microsoft Bing Copilot, a publicly available generative AI system. We find the most common work activities people seek AI assistance for involve gathering information and writing, while the most common activities that AI itself is performing are providing information and assistance, writing, teaching, and advising. Combining these activity classifications with measurements of task success and scope of impact, we compute an AI applicability score for each occupation. We find the highest AI applicability scores for knowledge work occupation groups such as computer and mathematical, and office and administrative support, as well as occupations such as sales whose work activities involve providing and communicating information. Additionally, we characterize the types of work activities performed most successfully, how wage and education correlate with AI applicability, and how real-world usage compares to predictions of occupational AI impact.

<div> IDS, UAVs, cGAN, adversarial attacks, cybersecurity
Summary:<br /><br />The article discusses the need for effective intrusion detection systems (IDS) in protecting UAVs in civilian airspace. Traditional anomaly detection methods are not always successful in identifying new threats, making it essential to develop resilient and intelligent IDS. The paper introduces a framework using a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) to create stealthy adversarial attacks that can evade IDS mechanisms. These attacks are crafted to appear as benign while still resembling out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. A conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) is used to detect these perturbations, showing superior performance in identifying adversarial threats compared to traditional detectors. The study highlights the significance of advanced probabilistic modeling in enhancing IDS capabilities against adaptive cyber intrusions. <div>

Abstract: The growing integration of UAVs into civilian airspace underscores the need for resilient and intelligent intrusion detection systems (IDS), as traditional anomaly detection methods often fail to identify novel threats. A common approach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples; however, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate. Moreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy adversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting stealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a robust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known cyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI), man-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks. Using this classifier, our cGAN perturbs known attacks to generate adversarial samples that misclassify as benign while retaining statistical resemblance to OOD distributions. These adversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success rates. To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial inputs from authentic OOD samples. Comparative evaluation shows that CVAE-based regret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based detectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats. Our findings emphasize the importance of advanced probabilistic modeling to strengthen IDS capabilities against adaptive, generative-model-based cyber intrusions.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces a Multi-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model for Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) to address issues of mention ambiguity and dynamic selection of modal content. The model includes modules for description-aware mention enhancement, multimodal feature extraction, intra-level mixture of experts, and inter-level mixture of experts. The description-aware module uses large language models to enhance mentions by matching them with relevant WikiData descriptions. The multimodal feature extraction module obtains textual and visual embeddings for mentions and entities. The mixture of experts modules dynamically select features from different regions of information. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MMoE over existing approaches. Code for MMoE is available on GitHub. <div>

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to link ambiguous mentions within multimodal contexts to associated entities in a multimodal knowledge base. Existing approaches to MEL introduce multimodal interaction and fusion mechanisms to bridge the modality gap and enable multi-grained semantic matching. However, they do not address two important problems: (i) mention ambiguity, i.e., the lack of semantic content caused by the brevity and omission of key information in the mention's textual context; (ii) dynamic selection of modal content, i.e., to dynamically distinguish the importance of different parts of modal information. To mitigate these issues, we propose a Multi-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model for MEL. MMoE has four components: (i) the description-aware mention enhancement module leverages large language models to identify the WikiData descriptions that best match a mention, considering the mention's textual context; (ii) the multimodal feature extraction module adopts multimodal feature encoders to obtain textual and visual embeddings for both mentions and entities; (iii)-(iv) the intra-level mixture of experts and inter-level mixture of experts modules apply a switch mixture of experts mechanism to dynamically and adaptively select features from relevant regions of information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the outstanding performance of MMoE compared to the state-of-the-art. MMoE's code is available at: https://github.com/zhiweihu1103/MEL-MMoE.

Summary: <br />
This paper evaluates the storage of semantic data on different types of distributed ledger technologies (DLT) within data spaces. It highlights the importance of semantic web technologies and knowledge graphs for achieving semantic interoperability in decentralized data exchange environments. The study compares performance, storage efficiency, resource consumption, and the capabilities of updating and querying semantic data across public, private, and hybrid DLTs. The results indicate that private DLTs are most efficient for storing and managing semantic content, while hybrid DLTs provide a balance between public auditability and operational efficiency.

Abstract: Data spaces are emerging as decentralised infrastructures that enable sovereign, secure, and trustworthy data exchange among multiple participants. To achieve semantic interoperability within these environments, the use of semantic web technologies and knowledge graphs has been proposed. Although distributed ledger technologies (DLT) fit as the underlying infrastructure for data spaces, there remains a significant gap in terms of the efficient storage of semantic data on these platforms. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of semantic data storage across different types of DLT (public, private, and hybrid), using a real-world knowledge graph as an experimental basis. The study compares performance, storage efficiency, resource consumption, and the capabilities to update and query semantic data. The results show that private DLTs are the most efficient for storing and managing semantic content, while hybrid DLTs offer a balanced trade-off between public auditability and operational efficiency. This research leads to a discussion on the selection of the most appropriate DLT infrastructure based on the data sovereignty requirements of decentralised data ecosystems.

Summary: 
Machine Learning jobs on distributed systems often involve periodic communication, leading to network congestion and packet loss. Analyzing collective communication patterns is crucial for provisioning network resources based on workload types. This study examines the behavior of collective communication in various machine learning models by instrumenting Nvidia Collective Communication Library. By adjusting configuration parameters and analyzing communication behavior in DeepSeek V3 model, the study reveals insights such as operation types, transfer sizes, and request size distribution. The results suggest the need to reconsider current collective communication frameworks and network topologies to address network anomalies affecting machine learning workloads. This analysis highlights the importance of optimizing network resources for efficient performance of machine learning tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Machine Learning jobs, carried out on large number of distributed high performance systems, involve periodic communication using operations like AllReduce, AllGather, and Broadcast. These operations may create high bandwidth and bursty traffic patterns, leading to network congestion and packet loss, thus impacting the performance of these jobs. Hence it is imperative to analyze these patterns, which can be helpful in provisioning network resources depending on the type of machine learning workloads. In this poster we carry out extensive analysis of the collective communication behavior seen in a wide variety of models (ex. DeepSeek, GPT, Llama, etc.) To achieve this we instrument Nvidia Collective Communication Library logging functionality for richer context about the collectives and workloads. We adjust configuration parameters that influence collective communication behavior, such as parallelism, number of nodes, and model type. This overview presents and discusses some of the results on the collective communication behavior for the open source DeepSeek V3 inferencing model, which includes operation type and count, transfer sizes per operation, and request size distribution. Our analysis shows that it makes sense to rethink current collective communication frameworks and network topologies so as to accommodate the effect of network anomalies on the mentioned workloads.

<div> Keywords: LLMs, Token-to-Token Latency, Tensor Parallelism, Helix Parallelism, DeepSeek-R1 

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges faced by Large Language Models (LLMs) when scaling to multi-million-token KV histories in real-time autoregressive decoding under tight Token-to-Token Latency (TTL) constraints. The core bottlenecks identified are accessing Feed-Forward Network (FFN) weights and reading long KV caches. Traditional Tensor Parallelism (TP) is effective for FFN weight reads but does not scale well for attention, leading to inefficient KV duplication and constraints on batch size. The solution proposed is Helix Parallelism, a hybrid execution strategy that applies KV parallelism during attention and TP or TPxExpert Parallel (EP) during FFN computation. Helix reduces TTL by up to 1.5x at fixed batch sizes, supports larger batches under the same latency budget, and enhances GPU efficiency through batchwise overlap. Ultimately, Helix enables real-time inference with ultra-long sequences in LLMs, pushing forward the throughput-latency Pareto on Blackwell.

Abstract: As LLMs scale to multi-million-token KV histories, real-time autoregressive decoding under tight Token-to-Token Latency (TTL) constraints faces growing pressure. Two core bottlenecks dominate: accessing Feed-Forward Network (FFN) weights and reading long KV caches. While Tensor Parallelism (TP) helps mitigate the cost of FFN weight reads, it does not scale well for attention. When TP width exceeds the number of KV heads, it leads to inefficient KV duplication, limits parallelism, and constrains batch size. Simultaneously, DRAM reads for long KV histories scale linearly with batch size, further capping efficiency.
  We introduce Helix Parallelism, a hybrid execution strategy that applies KV parallelism during attention to shard KV caches across GPUs, then reuses the same GPUs for TP in dense LLMs or TPxExpert Parallel (EP) in MoEs during FFN computation. To preserve exact attention behavior, Helix includes a lightweight communication step. To minimize the exposed communication cost, we introduce Helix HOP-B. Helix HOP-B effectively minimizes communication overhead through batchwise overlap, preserving low TTL while improving GPU efficiency. Compared to conventional parallelism approaches, Helix reduces TTL by up to 1.5x at fixed batch sizes and supports up to 32x larger batches under the same latency budget for DeepSeek-R1, pushing forward the throughput-latency Pareto on Blackwell and making real-time inference with ultra-long-sequence practical.

Abstract: PET-CT lesion segmentation is challenging due to noise sensitivity, small and variable lesion morphology, and interference from physiological high-metabolic signals. Current mainstream approaches follow the practice of one network solving the segmentation of multiple cancer lesions by treating all cancers as a single task. However, this overlooks the unique characteristics of different cancer types. Considering the specificity and similarity of different cancers in terms of metastatic patterns, organ preferences, and FDG uptake intensity, we propose DpDNet, a Dual-Prompt-Driven network that incorporates specific prompts to capture cancer-specific features and common prompts to retain shared knowledge. Additionally, to mitigate information forgetting caused by the early introduction of prompts, prompt-aware heads are employed after the decoder to adaptively handle multiple segmentation tasks. Experiments on a PET-CT dataset with four cancer types show that DpDNet outperforms state-of-the-art models. Finally, based on the segmentation results, we calculated MTV, TLG, and SUVmax for breast cancer survival analysis. The results suggest that DpDNet has the potential to serve as a valuable tool for personalized risk stratification, supporting clinicians in optimizing treatment strategies and improving outcomes.

<div> diffusion-based inpainting model, generative panoramic image stitching, reference images, seamless panoramas, multiple image integration
Summary:
Our proposed method addresses the challenge of generative panoramic image stitching by fine-tuning a diffusion-based inpainting model to preserve scene content and layout from multiple reference images. Traditional image stitching pipelines struggle with parallax effects and variations in lighting, camera settings, and style, leading to artifacts in outputs. While recent generative models can outpaint content consistent with multiple reference images, they fail to create large, coherent panoramas. Our approach significantly outperforms baselines by synthesizing seamless panoramas that faithfully integrate content from all reference images. By outpainting a full panorama from a single reference image, our model produces visually coherent results with superior image quality and consistent scene layout. Evaluation on captured datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in generating high-quality panoramas. <div>

Abstract: We introduce the task of generative panoramic image stitching, which aims to synthesize seamless panoramas that are faithful to the content of multiple reference images containing parallax effects and strong variations in lighting, camera capture settings, or style. In this challenging setting, traditional image stitching pipelines fail, producing outputs with ghosting and other artifacts. While recent generative models are capable of outpainting content consistent with multiple reference images, they fail when tasked with synthesizing large, coherent regions of a panorama. To address these limitations, we propose a method that fine-tunes a diffusion-based inpainting model to preserve a scene's content and layout based on multiple reference images. Once fine-tuned, the model outpaints a full panorama from a single reference image, producing a seamless and visually coherent result that faithfully integrates content from all reference images. Our approach significantly outperforms baselines for this task in terms of image quality and the consistency of image structure and scene layout when evaluated on captured datasets.

Summary:
In this study, a new approach called Description-free Multi-prompt Learning (DeMul) is proposed for leveraging pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLM) and Large Language Models (LLM) for downstream tasks. DeMul eliminates the need to extract descriptions from LLM and instead directly distills knowledge into prompts, enhancing semantic richness and eliminating the need for predefined templates. The study also explores the use of prompt weighting in a multi-prompt setting to reflect the importance of different prompts during training. Experimental results across 11 recognition datasets demonstrate superior performance using the DeMul approach. Overall, DeMul shows potential in enhancing the robustness and effectiveness of VLM and LLM in adapting to diverse and unseen data, paving the way for improved performance in downstream tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLM) have shown promising potential for effectively adapting to downstream tasks through prompt learning, without the need for additional annotated paired datasets. To supplement the text information in VLM trained on correlations with vision data, new approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) in prompts have been proposed, enhancing robustness to unseen and diverse data. Existing methods typically extract text-based responses (i.e., descriptions) from LLM to incorporate into prompts; however, this approach suffers from high variability and low reliability. In this work, we propose Description-free Multi-prompt Learning(DeMul), a novel method that eliminates the process of extracting descriptions and instead directly distills knowledge from LLM into prompts. By adopting a description-free approach, prompts can encapsulate richer semantics while still being represented as continuous vectors for optimization, thereby eliminating the need for discrete pre-defined templates. Additionally, in a multi-prompt setting, we empirically demonstrate the potential of prompt weighting in reflecting the importance of different prompts during training. Experimental results show that our approach achieves superior performance across 11 recognition datasets.

Summary:<br />
This paper explores the issue of hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) due to modality conflict. The study focuses on conflicts within inputs from different modalities that confuse MLLMs and lead to hallucinations. The researchers define modality conflict and create the Multimodal Modality Conflict (MMMC) dataset to simulate this phenomenon. Three methods - prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning - are proposed to address hallucinations caused by modality conflict. Experiment results show that reinforcement learning is the most effective in reducing hallucinations, with supervised fine-tuning also offering promising results. The study highlights the importance of considering modality conflict in addressing hallucinations in MLLMs and provides insights into enhancing their robustness. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in vision-language tasks, they are prone to hallucinations in real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the hallucination phenomenon in MLLMs from the perspective of modality conflict. Unlike existing works focusing on the conflicts between model responses and inputs, we study the inherent conflicts in inputs from different modalities that place MLLMs in a dilemma and directly lead to hallucinations. We formally define the modality conflict and construct a dataset named Multimodal Modality Conflict (MMMC) to simulate this phenomenon in vision-language tasks. Three methods based on prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are proposed to alleviate the hallucination caused by modality conflict. Extensive experiments are conducted on the MMMC dataset to analyze the merits and demerits of these methods. Our results show that the reinforcement learning method achieves the best performance in mitigating the hallucination under modality conflict, while the supervised fine-tuning method shows promising and stable performance. Our work sheds light on the unnoticed modality conflict that leads to hallucinations and provides more insights into the robustness of MLLMs.

Summary: 
Maritime surveillance and target vessel identification without GNSS is crucial for various applications. This study proposes using the YOLOv8 object detection model, feature matching, and hue histogram distance analysis to detect and identify vessels using on-board vision from UAVs. The method is tested in real-world experiments during the MBZIRC2023 competition, where it was integrated into a fully autonomous system with GNSS-denied navigation. The impact of perspective on detection accuracy and localization precision was evaluated and compared with the oracle approach. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in detecting and localizing target vessels in a large search area. <div>

Abstract: Autonomous maritime surveillance and target vessel identification in environments where Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are not available is critical for a number of applications such as search and rescue and threat detection. When the target vessel is only described by visual cues and its last known position is not available, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must rely solely on on-board vision to scan a large search area under strict computational constraints. To address this challenge, we leverage the YOLOv8 object detection model to detect all vessels in the field of view. We then apply feature matching and hue histogram distance analysis to determine whether any detected vessel corresponds to the target. When found, we localize the target using simple geometric principles. We demonstrate the proposed method in real-world experiments during the MBZIRC2023 competition, integrated into a fully autonomous system with GNSS-denied navigation. We also evaluate the impact of perspective on detection accuracy and localization precision and compare it with the oracle approach.

We find that currently the best RAG agent configuration is with OpenAI embedding and generative model, yielding 91.4\% accuracy. Using our human evaluation results we calibrate LLM-as-a-Judge (LLMaaJ) system which can be used as a robust proxy for human evaluation. These results allow us to systematically select the best RAG agent configuration for multi-agent system for autonomous scientific discovery in astrophysics (e.g., cmbagent presented in a companion paper) and provide us with an LLMaaJ system that can be scaled to thousands of cosmology QA pairs. We make our QA dataset, human evaluation results, RAG pipelines, and LLMaaJ system publicly available for further use by the astrophysics community.

<div> cognitive biases, large language models, training randomness, pretraining, finetuning <br />
Summary:
Training randomness impacts cognitive biases in large language models (LLMs), but biases are primarily shaped by pretraining rather than finetuning effects. The study involves finetuning models multiple times with different random seeds to assess over 30 cognitive biases and introduces a cross-tuning technique by swapping instruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. Despite some variability introduced by training randomness, models sharing the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those sharing only finetuning data. This indicates that biases in finetuned LLMs are heavily influenced by their pretraining origins, emphasizing the need to consider pretraining effects when evaluating and addressing biases in LLMs. The findings suggest the importance of developing systematic approaches to understand and mitigate biases in LLMs beyond the finetuning process. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit cognitive biases -- systematic tendencies of irrational decision-making, similar to those seen in humans. Prior work has found that these biases vary across models and can be amplified by instruction tuning. However, it remains unclear if these differences in biases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or even random noise due to training stochasticity. We propose a two-step causal experimental approach to disentangle these factors. First, we finetune models multiple times using different random seeds to study how training randomness affects over $30$ cognitive biases. Second, we introduce \emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping instruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses datasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases are dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness introduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models with the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those sharing only finetuning data. These insights suggest that understanding biases in finetuned models requires considering their pretraining origins beyond finetuning effects. This perspective can guide future efforts to develop principled strategies for evaluating and mitigating bias in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxies for human subjects in social science surveys, but their reliability and susceptibility to known response biases are poorly understood. This paper investigates the response robustness of LLMs in normative survey contexts -- we test nine diverse LLMs on questions from the World Values Survey (WVS), applying a comprehensive set of 11 perturbations to both question phrasing and answer option structure, resulting in over 167,000 simulated interviews. In doing so, we not only reveal LLMs' vulnerabilities to perturbations but also reveal that all tested models exhibit a consistent \textit{recency bias} varying in intensity, disproportionately favoring the last-presented answer option. While larger models are generally more robust, all models remain sensitive to semantic variations like paraphrasing and to combined perturbations. By applying a set of perturbations, we reveal that LLMs partially align with survey response biases identified in humans. This underscores the critical importance of prompt design and robustness testing when using LLMs to generate synthetic survey data.

Summary: Conditional Guided Flow Matching (CGFM) is proposed to enhance time series forecasting by combining flow matching with an auxiliary model. By leveraging historical data as conditions and guidance, CGFM constructs conditional probability paths and utilizes a general affine path to expand the probability space, leading to improved predictions. The model's ability to learn from the errors of the auxiliary model sets it apart from existing methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CGFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, showcasing its effectiveness in advancing forecasting techniques. <div>

Abstract: Diffusion models, a type of generative model, have shown promise in time series forecasting. But they face limitations like rigid source distributions and limited sampling paths, which hinder their performance. Flow matching offers faster generation, higher-quality outputs, and greater flexibility, while also possessing the ability to utilize valuable information from the prediction errors of prior models, which were previously inaccessible yet critically important. To address these challenges and fully unlock the untapped potential of flow matching, we propose Conditional Guided Flow Matching (CGFM). CGFM extends flow matching by incorporating the outputs of an auxiliary model, enabling a previously unattainable capability in the field: learning from the errors of the auxiliary model. For time series forecasting tasks, it integrates historical data as conditions and guidance, constructs two-sided conditional probability paths, and uses a general affine path to expand the space of probability paths, ultimately leading to improved predictions. Extensive experiments show that CGFM consistently enhances and outperforms state-of-the-art models, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing forecasting methods.

Summary: 
This study focuses on combining multiple pre-trained models to enhance state representation in Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks. The proposed Weight Sharing Attention (WSA) architecture aims to leverage the latent embeddings of various pre-trained models efficiently and effectively. By balancing efficiency and performance, WSA demonstrates comparable results to traditional end-to-end models in multiple Atari games. The research also explores the generalization capabilities of this approach and examines how increasing the number of pre-trained models impacts agent performance during and after training. The findings suggest that the WSA approach offers a promising strategy for leveraging hidden information from diverse pre-trained models in RL tasks. <div>
arXiv:2507.07197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent focus and release of pre-trained models have been a key components to several advancements in many fields (e.g. Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision), as a matter of fact, pre-trained models learn disparate latent embeddings sharing insightful representations. On the other hand, Reinforcement Learning (RL) focuses on maximizing the cumulative reward obtained via agent's interaction with the environment. RL agents do not have any prior knowledge about the world, and they either learn from scratch an end-to-end mapping between the observation and action spaces or, in more recent works, are paired with monolithic and computationally expensive Foundational Models. How to effectively combine and leverage the hidden information of different pre-trained models simultaneously in RL is still an open and understudied question. In this work, we propose Weight Sharing Attention (WSA), a new architecture to combine embeddings of multiple pre-trained models to shape an enriched state representation, balancing the tradeoff between efficiency and performance. We run an extensive comparison between several combination modes showing that WSA obtains comparable performance on multiple Atari games compared to end-to-end models. Furthermore, we study the generalization capabilities of this approach and analyze how scaling the number of models influences agents' performance during and after training.

<div> Keywords: molecular generators, diffusion models, stereochemical fidelity, multi-task training, de novo design

Summary: 
The article introduces MODA, a diffusion framework that enhances the accuracy and efficiency of three-dimensional molecular generators by unifying various tasks such as fragment growing, linker design, scaffold hopping, and side-chain decoration. The framework incorporates a Bayesian mask scheduler and utilizes a single-stage multi-task training approach, surpassing traditional two-stage workflows. The model, particularly Model-C, shows significant improvements in substructure accuracy, chemical property prediction, interaction, geometry, and lead optimization tests. Model-B, while preserving similarity, lags in novelty and binding affinity. The results demonstrate stable negative Vina scores, high improvement rates in de novo design and lead optimization, and Lipinski compliance without the need for force-field refinement. This diffusion framework offers a more efficient and accurate approach to structure-based molecular design. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.07201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional molecular generators based on diffusion models can now reach near-crystallographic accuracy, yet they remain fragmented across tasks. SMILES-only inputs, two-stage pretrain-finetune pipelines, and one-task-one-model practices hinder stereochemical fidelity, task alignment, and zero-shot transfer. We introduce MODA, a diffusion framework that unifies fragment growing, linker design, scaffold hopping, and side-chain decoration with a Bayesian mask scheduler. During training, a contiguous spatial fragment is masked and then denoised in one pass, enabling the model to learn shared geometric and chemical priors across tasks. Multi-task training yields a universal backbone that surpasses six diffusion baselines and three training paradigms on substructure, chemical property, interaction, and geometry. Model-C reduces ligand-protein clashes and substructure divergences while maintaining Lipinski compliance, whereas Model-B preserves similarity but trails in novelty and binding affinity. Zero-shot de novo design and lead-optimisation tests confirm stable negative Vina scores and high improvement rates without force-field refinement. These results demonstrate that a single-stage multi-task diffusion routine can replace two-stage workflows for structure-based molecular design.

Abstract: Reliable data is a cornerstone of modern organizational systems. A notable data integrity challenge stems from label bias, which refers to systematic errors in a label, a covariate that is central to a quantitative analysis, such that its quality differs across social groups. This type of bias has been conceptually and empirically explored and is widely recognized as a pressing issue across critical domains. However, effective methodologies for addressing it remain scarce. In this work, we propose Decoupled Confident Learning (DeCoLe), a principled machine learning based framework specifically designed to detect mislabeled instances in datasets affected by label bias, enabling bias aware mislabelling detection and facilitating data quality improvement. We theoretically justify the effectiveness of DeCoLe and evaluate its performance in the impactful context of hate speech detection, a domain where label bias is a well documented challenge. Empirical results demonstrate that DeCoLe excels at bias aware mislabeling detection, consistently outperforming alternative approaches for label error detection. Our work identifies and addresses the challenge of bias aware mislabeling detection and offers guidance on how DeCoLe can be integrated into organizational data management practices as a powerful tool to enhance data reliability.

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) exhibit inconsistent behavior across inputs, highlighting the need for quantifying uncertainty in critical applications. Existing methods for calibration and uncertainty estimation often overlook the potential benefits of leveraging model diversity. This study introduces MUSE (Multi-LLM Uncertainty via Subset Ensembles), a novel approach that leverages differences in training and language distribution to aggregate predictions from multiple LLMs. By using Jensen-Shannon Divergence to identify well-calibrated subsets of models, MUSE improves calibration and predictive performance on binary tasks compared to single-model and naive ensemble approaches. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of ensemble learning in enhancing uncertainty quantification in LLMs, paving the way for more reliable and accurate model predictions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often behave inconsistently across inputs, indicating uncertainty and motivating the need for its quantification in high-stakes settings. Prior work on calibration and uncertainty quantification often focuses on individual models, overlooking the potential of model diversity. We hypothesize that LLMs make complementary predictions due to differences in training and the Zipfian nature of language, and that aggregating their outputs leads to more reliable uncertainty estimates. To leverage this, we propose MUSE (Multi-LLM Uncertainty via Subset Ensembles), a simple information-theoretic method that uses Jensen-Shannon Divergence to identify and aggregate well-calibrated subsets of LLMs. Experiments on binary prediction tasks demonstrate improved calibration and predictive performance compared to single-model and naive ensemble baselines.

Summary:
Efficiency of attention mechanisms in large language and visual language models is crucial due to their computational demands. This study evaluates eight attention mechanisms during GPT-2 training, focusing on metrics like training time, GPU memory usage, FLOPS, CPU usage, and power consumption. Results show that Flash Attention, LSH Attention, and MLA are the most energy-efficient mechanisms due to optimized kernel implementations. Lower GPU power does not always lead to reduced energy consumption, as training time also influences efficiency. The study emphasizes the significance of energy-aware benchmarking in attention mechanism design, providing practical guidance for selecting resource-efficient mechanisms. The research code is available on GitHub.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) and visual language models (VLMs) grow in scale and application, attention mechanisms have become a central computational bottleneck due to their high memory and time complexity. While many efficient attention variants have been proposed, there remains a lack of rigorous evaluation on their actual energy usage and hardware resource demands during training. In this work, we benchmark eight attention mechanisms in training GPT-2 architecture, measuring key metrics including training time, GPU memory usage, FLOPS, CPU usage, and power consumption. Our results reveal that attention mechanisms with optimized kernel implementations, including Flash Attention, Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) Attention, and Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA), achieve the best energy efficiency. We further show that lower GPU power alone does not guarantee reduced energy use, as training time plays an equally important role. Our study highlights the importance of energy-aware benchmarking in attention design and provides a practical insight for selecting resource-efficient mechanisms. All our codes are available at GitHub.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces FedP3E, a novel Federated Learning (FL) framework designed to address the challenges posed by malware attacks in IoT ecosystems. FedP3E enables decentralized model training while maintaining data privacy, utilizing Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to construct class-wise prototypes. These prototypes are perturbed with noise, transmitted to the server, aggregated, and distributed back to clients for local training. The framework incorporates SMOTE-based augmentation to enhance representation of minority malware classes, facilitating better model performance. By leveraging a prototype-driven mechanism instead of parameter averaging, FedP3E allows clients to enrich their models with structural patterns observed across the federation, reducing the impact of data heterogeneity. The approach proves effective in scenarios with varying degrees of data imbalance, showcasing its potential in enhancing security in IoT environments. <br /> <div>

Abstract: As IoT ecosystems continue to expand across critical sectors, they have become prominent targets for increasingly sophisticated and large-scale malware attacks. The evolving threat landscape, combined with the sensitive nature of IoT-generated data, demands detection frameworks that are both privacy-preserving and resilient to data heterogeneity. Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising solution by enabling decentralized model training without exposing raw data. However, standard FL algorithms such as FedAvg and FedProx often fall short in real-world deployments characterized by class imbalance and non-IID data distributions -- particularly in the presence of rare or disjoint malware classes. To address these challenges, we propose FedP3E (Privacy-Preserving Prototype Exchange), a novel FL framework that supports indirect cross-client representation sharing while maintaining data privacy. Each client constructs class-wise prototypes using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), perturbs them with Gaussian noise, and transmits only these compact summaries to the server. The aggregated prototypes are then distributed back to clients and integrated into local training, supported by SMOTE-based augmentation to enhance representation of minority malware classes. Rather than relying solely on parameter averaging, our prototype-driven mechanism enables clients to enrich their local models with complementary structural patterns observed across the federation -- without exchanging raw data or gradients. This targeted strategy reduces the adverse impact of statistical heterogeneity with minimal communication overhead. We evaluate FedP3E on the N-BaIoT dataset under realistic cross-silo scenarios with varying degrees of data imbalance.

arXiv:2507.07259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly deployed across the edge of internet of things environments, a partitioned deep learning paradigm in which models are split across multiple computational nodes introduces a new dimension of security risk. Unlike traditional inference setups, these distributed pipelines span the model computation across heterogeneous nodes and communication layers, thereby exposing a broader attack surface to potential adversaries. Building on these motivations, this work explores a previously overlooked vulnerability: even when both the edge and cloud components of the model are inaccessible (i.e., black-box), an adversary who intercepts the intermediate features transmitted between them can still pose a serious threat. We demonstrate that, under these mild and realistic assumptions, an attacker can craft highly transferable proxy models, making the entire deep learning system significantly more vulnerable to evasion attacks. In particular, the intercepted features can be effectively analyzed and leveraged to distill surrogate models capable of crafting highly transferable adversarial examples against the target model. To this end, we propose an exploitation strategy specifically designed for distributed settings, which involves reconstructing the original tensor shape from vectorized transmitted features using simple statistical analysis, and adapting surrogate architectures accordingly to enable effective feature distillation. A comprehensive and systematic experimental evaluation has been conducted to demonstrate that surrogate models trained with the proposed strategy, i.e., leveraging intermediate features, tremendously improve the transferability of adversarial attacks. These findings underscore the urgent need to account for intermediate feature leakage in the design of secure distributed deep learning systems.

Our dataset comprises 6,875 image-text pairs spanning 11 languages and five social attributes. We evaluate models using three key metrics: Bias, Answer Relevancy, and Faithfulness. Our findings reveal that closed-source models generally achieve the highest overall performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate scientifically plausible but factually invalid information, a challenge we term the "plausibility-validity gap," particularly in specialized domains like chemistry. This paper presents a systematic methodology to bridge this gap by developing a specialized scientific assistant. We utilized the Magistral Small model, noted for its integrated reasoning capabilities, and fine-tuned it using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). A key component of our approach was the creation of a "dual-domain dataset," a comprehensive corpus curated from various sources encompassing both molecular properties and chemical reactions, which was standardized to ensure quality. Our evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned model achieves significant improvements over the baseline model in format adherence, chemical validity of generated molecules, and the feasibility of proposed synthesis routes. The results indicate a hierarchical learning pattern, where syntactic correctness is learned more readily than chemical possibility and synthesis feasibility. While a comparative analysis with human experts revealed competitive performance in areas like chemical creativity and reasoning, it also highlighted key limitations, including persistent errors in stereochemistry, a static knowledge cutoff, and occasional reference hallucination. This work establishes a viable framework for adapting generalist LLMs into reliable, specialized tools for chemical research, while also delineating critical areas for future improvement.

Abstract: Graph transformers typically embed every node in a single Euclidean space, blurring heterogeneous topologies. We prepend a lightweight Riemannian mixture-of-experts layer that routes each node to various kinds of manifold, mixture of spherical, flat, hyperbolic - best matching its local structure. These projections provide intrinsic geometric explanations to the latent space. Inserted into a state-of-the-art ensemble graph transformer, this projector lifts accuracy by up to 3% on four node-classification benchmarks. The ensemble makes sure that both euclidean and non-euclidean features are captured. Explicit, geometry-aware projection thus sharpens predictive power while making graph representations more interpretable.

Abstract: We present GO-CBED, a goal-oriented Bayesian framework for sequential causal experimental design. Unlike conventional approaches that select interventions aimed at inferring the full causal model, GO-CBED directly maximizes the expected information gain (EIG) on user-specified causal quantities of interest, enabling more targeted and efficient experimentation. The framework is both non-myopic, optimizing over entire intervention sequences, and goal-oriented, targeting only model aspects relevant to the causal query. To address the intractability of exact EIG computation, we introduce a variational lower bound estimator, optimized jointly through a transformer-based policy network and normalizing flow-based variational posteriors. The resulting policy enables real-time decision-making via an amortized network. We demonstrate that GO-CBED consistently outperforms existing baselines across various causal reasoning and discovery tasks-including synthetic structural causal models and semi-synthetic gene regulatory networks-particularly in settings with limited experimental budgets and complex causal mechanisms. Our results highlight the benefits of aligning experimental design objectives with specific research goals and of forward-looking sequential planning.

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem pertaining to personalized classification of subclinical atherosclerosis by developing a hierarchical graph neural network framework to leverage two characteristic modalities of a patient: clinical features within the context of the cohort, and molecular data unique to individual patients. Current graph-based methods for disease classification detect patient-specific molecular fingerprints, but lack consistency and comprehension regarding cohort-wide features, which are an essential requirement for understanding pathogenic phenotypes across diverse atherosclerotic trajectories. Furthermore, understanding patient subtypes often considers clinical feature similarity in isolation, without integration of shared pathogenic interdependencies among patients. To address these challenges, we introduce ATHENA: Atherosclerosis Through Hierarchical Explainable Neural Network Analysis, which constructs a novel hierarchical network representation through integrated modality learning; subsequently, it optimizes learned patient-specific molecular fingerprints that reflect individual omics data, enforcing consistency with cohort-wide patterns. With a primary clinical dataset of 391 patients, we demonstrate that this heterogeneous alignment of clinical features with molecular interaction patterns has significantly boosted subclinical atherosclerosis classification performance across various baselines by up to 13% in area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) and 20% in F1 score. Taken together, ATHENA enables mechanistically-informed patient subtype discovery through explainable AI (XAI)-driven subnetwork clustering; this novel integration framework strengthens personalized intervention strategies, thereby improving the prediction of atherosclerotic disease progression and management of their clinical actionable outcomes.

<title>PILOC: A Pheromone Inverse Guidance Mechanism and Local-Communication Framework for Dynamic Target Search of Multi-Agent in Unknown Environments</title>

Abstract: Multi-Agent Search and Rescue (MASAR) plays a vital role in disaster response, exploration, and reconnaissance. However, dynamic and unknown environments pose significant challenges due to target unpredictability and environmental uncertainty. To tackle these issues, we propose PILOC, a framework that operates without global prior knowledge, leveraging local perception and communication. It introduces a pheromone inverse guidance mechanism to enable efficient coordination and dynamic target localization. PILOC promotes decentralized cooperation through local communication, significantly reducing reliance on global channels. Unlike conventional heuristics, the pheromone mechanism is embedded into the observation space of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), supporting indirect agent coordination based on environmental cues. We further integrate this strategy into a DRL-based multi-agent architecture and conduct extensive experiments. Results show that combining local communication with pheromone-based guidance significantly boosts search efficiency, adaptability, and system robustness. Compared to existing methods, PILOC performs better under dynamic and communication-constrained scenarios, offering promising directions for future MASAR applications.

Abstract: We propose \textbf{KeyRe-ID}, a keypoint-guided video-based person re-identification framework consisting of global and local branches that leverage human keypoints for enhanced spatiotemporal representation learning. The global branch captures holistic identity semantics through Transformer-based temporal aggregation, while the local branch dynamically segments body regions based on keypoints to generate fine-grained, part-aware features. Extensive experiments on MARS and iLIDS-VID benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving 91.73\% mAP and 97.32\% Rank-1 accuracy on MARS, and 96.00\% Rank-1 and 100.0\% Rank-5 accuracy on iLIDS-VID. The code for this work will be publicly available on GitHub upon publication.

Abstract: Animal motion embodies species-specific behavioral habits, making the transfer of motion across categories a critical yet complex task for applications in animation and virtual reality. Existing motion transfer methods, primarily focused on human motion, emphasize skeletal alignment (motion retargeting) or stylistic consistency (motion style transfer), often neglecting the preservation of distinct habitual behaviors in animals. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel habit-preserved motion transfer framework for cross-category animal motion. Built upon a generative framework, our model introduces a habit-preservation module with category-specific habit encoder, allowing it to learn motion priors that capture distinctive habitual characteristics. Furthermore, we integrate a large language model (LLM) to facilitate the motion transfer to previously unobserved species. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce the DeformingThings4D-skl dataset, a quadruped dataset with skeletal bindings, and conduct extensive experiments and quantitative analyses, which validate the superiority of our proposed model.

Abstract: Statement autoformalization, the automated translation of statement from natural language into formal languages, has become a subject of extensive research, yet the development of robust automated evaluation metrics remains limited. Existing evaluation methods often lack semantic understanding, face challenges with high computational costs, and are constrained by the current progress of automated theorem proving. To address these issues, we propose GTED (Generalized Tree Edit Distance), a novel evaluation framework that first standardizes formal statements and converts them into operator trees, then determines the semantic similarity using the eponymous GTED metric. On the miniF2F and ProofNet benchmarks, GTED outperforms all baseline metrics by achieving the highest accuracy and Kappa scores, thus providing the community with a more faithful metric for automated evaluation. The code and experimental results are available at https://github.com/XiaoyangLiu-sjtu/GTED.

Abstract: The pre-training and fine-tuning methods have gained widespread attention in the field of heterogeneous graph neural networks due to their ability to leverage large amounts of unlabeled data during the pre-training phase, allowing the model to learn rich structural features. However, these methods face the issue of a mismatch between the pre-trained model and downstream tasks, leading to suboptimal performance in certain application scenarios. Prompt learning methods have emerged as a new direction in heterogeneous graph tasks, as they allow flexible adaptation of task representations to address target inconsistency. Building on this idea, this paper proposes a novel multi-task prompt framework for the heterogeneous graph domain, named HGMP. First, to bridge the gap between the pre-trained model and downstream tasks, we reformulate all downstream tasks into a unified graph-level task format. Next, we address the limitations of existing graph prompt learning methods, which struggle to integrate contrastive pre-training strategies in the heterogeneous graph domain. We design a graph-level contrastive pre-training strategy to better leverage heterogeneous information and enhance performance in multi-task scenarios. Finally, we introduce heterogeneous feature prompts, which enhance model performance by refining the representation of input graph features. Experimental results on public datasets show that our proposed method adapts well to various tasks and significantly outperforms baseline methods.

Abstract: Phishing attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, underscoring the need for detection systems that strike a balance between high accuracy and computational efficiency. This paper presents a comparative evaluation of traditional Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and quantized small-parameter Large Language Models (LLMs) for phishing detection. Through experiments on a curated dataset, we show that while LLMs currently underperform compared to ML and DL methods in terms of raw accuracy, they exhibit strong potential for identifying subtle, context-based phishing cues. We also investigate the impact of zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, revealing that LLM-rephrased emails can significantly degrade the performance of both ML and LLM-based detectors. Our benchmarking highlights that models like DeepSeek R1 Distill Qwen 14B (Q8_0) achieve competitive accuracy, above 80%, using only 17GB of VRAM, supporting their viability for cost-efficient deployment. We further assess the models' adversarial robustness and cost-performance tradeoffs, and demonstrate how lightweight LLMs can provide concise, interpretable explanations to support real-time decision-making. These findings position optimized LLMs as promising components in phishing defence systems and offer a path forward for integrating explainable, efficient AI into modern cybersecurity frameworks.

<title>Hybrid LLM-Enhanced Intrusion Detection for Zero-Day Threats in IoT Networks</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to intrusion detection by integrating traditional signature-based methods with the contextual understanding capabilities of the GPT-2 Large Language Model (LLM). As cyber threats become increasingly sophisticated, particularly in distributed, heterogeneous, and resource-constrained environments such as those enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT), the need for dynamic and adaptive Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) becomes increasingly urgent. While traditional methods remain effective for detecting known threats, they often fail to recognize new and evolving attack patterns. In contrast, GPT-2 excels at processing unstructured data and identifying complex semantic relationships, making it well-suited to uncovering subtle, zero-day attack vectors. We propose a hybrid IDS framework that merges the robustness of signature-based techniques with the adaptability of GPT-2-driven semantic analysis. Experimental evaluations on a representative intrusion dataset demonstrate that our model enhances detection accuracy by 6.3%, reduces false positives by 9.0%, and maintains near real-time responsiveness. These results affirm the potential of language model integration to build intelligent, scalable, and resilient cybersecurity defences suited for modern connected environments.

Abstract: Time, cost, and energy efficiency are critical considerations in Deep-Learning (DL), particularly when processing long texts. Transformers, which represent the current state of the art, exhibit quadratic computational complexity relative to input length, making them inefficient for extended documents. This study introduces a novel model architecture that combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), integrated with a real-time, end-to-end graph generation mechanism. The model processes compact batches of character-level inputs without requiring padding or truncation. To enhance performance while maintaining high speed and efficiency, the model incorporates information from Large Language Models (LLMs), such as token embeddings and sentiment polarities, through efficient dictionary lookups. It captures local contextual patterns using CNNs, expands local receptive fields via lattice-based graph structures, and employs small-world graphs to aggregate document-level information. The generated graphs exhibit structural properties indicative of meaningful semantic organization, with an average clustering coefficient of approximately 0.45 and an average shortest path length ranging between 4 and 5. The model is evaluated across multiple text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis and news-categorization, and is compared against state-of-the-art models. Experimental results confirm the proposed model's efficiency and competitive performance.

Abstract: Critical infrastructure systems, including energy grids, healthcare facilities, transportation networks, and water distribution systems, are pivotal to societal stability and economic resilience. However, the increasing interconnectivity of these systems exposes them to various cyber threats, including ransomware, Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, and Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). This paper examines cybersecurity vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure, highlighting the threat landscape, attack vectors, and the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in mitigating these risks. We propose a hybrid AI-driven cybersecurity framework to enhance real-time vulnerability detection, threat modelling, and automated remediation. This study also addresses the complexities of adversarial AI, regulatory compliance, and integration. Our findings provide actionable insights to strengthen the security and resilience of critical infrastructure systems against emerging cyber threats.

Abstract: A popular class of defenses against prompt injection attacks on large language models (LLMs) relies on fine-tuning the model to separate instructions and data, so that the LLM does not follow instructions that might be present with data. There are several academic systems and production-level implementations of this idea. We evaluate the robustness of this class of prompt injection defenses in the whitebox setting by constructing strong optimization-based attacks and showing that the defenses do not provide the claimed security properties. Specifically, we construct a novel attention-based attack algorithm for text-based LLMs and apply it to two recent whitebox defenses SecAlign (CCS 2025) and StruQ (USENIX Security 2025), showing attacks with success rates of up to 70% with modest increase in attacker budget in terms of tokens. Our findings make fundamental progress towards understanding the robustness of prompt injection defenses in the whitebox setting. We release our code and attacks at https://github.com/nishitvp/better_opts_attacks

Abstract: Online advertising is a vital revenue source for major internet platforms. Recently, joint advertising, which assigns a bundle of two advertisers in an ad slot instead of allocating a single advertiser, has emerged as an effective method for enhancing allocation efficiency and revenue. However, existing mechanisms for joint advertising fail to realize the optimality, as they tend to focus on individual advertisers and overlook bundle structures. This paper identifies an optimal mechanism for joint advertising in a single-slot setting. For multi-slot joint advertising, we propose \textbf{BundleNet}, a novel bundle-based neural network approach specifically designed for joint advertising. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the mechanisms generated by \textbf{BundleNet} approximate the theoretical analysis results in the single-slot setting and achieve state-of-the-art performance in the multi-slot setting. This significantly increases platform revenue while ensuring approximate dominant strategy incentive compatibility and individual rationality.

Abstract: Generative AI has demonstrated strong potential in healthcare, from clinical decision support to patient-facing chatbots that improve outcomes. A critical challenge for deployment is effective human-AI communication, where content must be both personalized and understandable. We introduce MedReadCtrl, a readability-controlled instruction tuning framework that enables LLMs to adjust output complexity without compromising meaning. Evaluations of nine datasets and three tasks across medical and general domains show that MedReadCtrl achieves significantly lower readability instruction-following errors than GPT-4 (e.g., 1.39 vs. 1.59 on ReadMe, p<0.001) and delivers substantial gains on unseen clinical tasks (e.g., +14.7 ROUGE-L, +6.18 SARI on MTSamples). Experts consistently preferred MedReadCtrl (71.7% vs. 23.3%), especially at low literacy levels. These gains reflect MedReadCtrl's ability to restructure clinical content into accessible, readability-aligned language while preserving medical intent, offering a scalable solution to support patient education and expand equitable access to AI-enabled care.

Abstract: Eviction is a significant yet understudied social determinants of health (SDoH), linked to housing instability, unemployment, and mental health. While eviction appears in unstructured electronic health records (EHRs), it is rarely coded in structured fields, limiting downstream applications. We introduce SynthEHR-Eviction, a scalable pipeline combining LLMs, human-in-the-loop annotation, and automated prompt optimization (APO) to extract eviction statuses from clinical notes. Using this pipeline, we created the largest public eviction-related SDoH dataset to date, comprising 14 fine-grained categories. Fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5, LLaMA3) trained on SynthEHR-Eviction achieved Macro-F1 scores of 88.8% (eviction) and 90.3% (other SDoH) on human validated data, outperforming GPT-4o-APO (87.8%, 87.3%), GPT-4o-mini-APO (69.1%, 78.1%), and BioBERT (60.7%, 68.3%), while enabling cost-effective deployment across various model sizes. The pipeline reduces annotation effort by over 80%, accelerates dataset creation, enables scalable eviction detection, and generalizes to other information extraction tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the distillation of time series reasoning capabilities into small, instruction-tuned language models as a step toward building interpretable time series foundation models. Leveraging a synthetic dataset of mean-reverting time series with systematically varied trends and noise levels, we generate natural language annotations using a large multimodal model and use these to supervise the fine-tuning of compact Qwen models. We introduce evaluation metrics that assess the quality of the distilled reasoning - focusing on trend direction, noise intensity, and extremum localization - and show that the post-trained models acquire meaningful interpretive capabilities. Our results highlight the feasibility of compressing time series understanding into lightweight, language-capable models suitable for on-device or privacy-sensitive deployment. This work contributes a concrete foundation toward developing small, interpretable models that explain temporal patterns in natural language.

Abstract: Melanoma, one of the deadliest types of skin cancer, accounts for thousands of fatalities globally. The bluish, blue-whitish, or blue-white veil (BWV) is a critical feature for diagnosing melanoma, yet research into detecting BWV in dermatological images is limited. This study utilizes a non-annotated skin lesion dataset, which is converted into an annotated dataset using a proposed imaging algorithm based on color threshold techniques on lesion patches and color palettes. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is designed and trained separately on three individual and combined dermoscopic datasets, using custom layers instead of standard activation function layers. The model is developed to categorize skin lesions based on the presence of BWV. The proposed DCNN demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional BWV detection models across different datasets. The model achieves a testing accuracy of 85.71% on the augmented PH2 dataset, 95.00% on the augmented ISIC archive dataset, 95.05% on the combined augmented (PH2+ISIC archive) dataset, and 90.00% on the Derm7pt dataset. An explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) algorithm is subsequently applied to interpret the DCNN's decision-making process regarding BWV detection. The proposed approach, coupled with XAI, significantly improves the detection of BWV in skin lesions, outperforming existing models and providing a robust tool for early melanoma diagnosis.

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OoD) segmentation is critical for safety-sensitive applications like autonomous driving. However, existing mask-based methods often suffer from boundary imprecision, inconsistent anomaly scores within objects, and false positives from background noise. We propose \textbf{\textit{Objectomaly}}, an objectness-aware refinement framework that incorporates object-level priors. Objectomaly consists of three stages: (1) Coarse Anomaly Scoring (CAS) using an existing OoD backbone, (2) Objectness-Aware Score Calibration (OASC) leveraging SAM-generated instance masks for object-level score normalization, and (3) Meticulous Boundary Precision (MBP) applying Laplacian filtering and Gaussian smoothing for contour refinement. Objectomaly achieves state-of-the-art performance on key OoD segmentation benchmarks, including SMIYC AnomalyTrack/ObstacleTrack and RoadAnomaly, improving both pixel-level (AuPRC up to 96.99, FPR$_{95}$ down to 0.07) and component-level (F1$-$score up to 83.44) metrics. Ablation studies and qualitative results on real-world driving videos further validate the robustness and generalizability of our method. Code will be released upon publication.

Abstract: Bullshit, as conceptualized by philosopher Harry Frankfurt, refers to statements made without regard to their truth value. While previous work has explored large language model (LLM) hallucination and sycophancy, we propose machine bullshit as an overarching conceptual framework that can allow researchers to characterize the broader phenomenon of emergent loss of truthfulness in LLMs and shed light on its underlying mechanisms. We introduce the Bullshit Index, a novel metric quantifying LLMs' indifference to truth, and propose a complementary taxonomy analyzing four qualitative forms of bullshit: empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, and unverified claims. We conduct empirical evaluations on the Marketplace dataset, the Political Neutrality dataset, and our new BullshitEval benchmark (2,400 scenarios spanning 100 AI assistants) explicitly designed to evaluate machine bullshit. Our results demonstrate that model fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) significantly exacerbates bullshit and inference-time chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting notably amplify specific bullshit forms, particularly empty rhetoric and paltering. We also observe prevalent machine bullshit in political contexts, with weasel words as the dominant strategy. Our findings highlight systematic challenges in AI alignment and provide new insights toward more truthful LLM behavior.

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables multiple tasks to be learned within a shared network, but differences in objectives across tasks can cause negative transfer, where the learning of one task degrades another task's performance. While pre-trained transformers significantly improve MTL performance, their fixed network capacity and rigid structure limit adaptability. Previous dynamic network architectures attempt to address this but are inefficient as they directly convert shared parameters into task-specific ones. We propose Dynamic Token Modulation and Expansion (DTME-MTL), a framework applicable to any transformer-based MTL architecture. DTME-MTL enhances adaptability and reduces overfitting by identifying gradient conflicts in token space and applying adaptive solutions based on conflict type. Unlike prior methods that mitigate negative transfer by duplicating network parameters, DTME-MTL operates entirely in token space, enabling efficient adaptation without excessive parameter growth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTME-MTL consistently improves multi-task performance with minimal computational overhead, offering a scalable and effective solution for enhancing transformer-based MTL models.

However, leveraging such planning structures during post-training to boost the performance of smaller open-source LLMs remains underexplored. Motivated by this, we introduce PLAN-TUNING, a unified post-training framework that (i) distills synthetic task decompositions (termed "planning trajectories") from large-scale LLMs and (ii) fine-tunes smaller models via supervised and reinforcement-learning objectives designed to mimic these planning processes to improve complex reasoning. On GSM8k and the MATH benchmarks, plan-tuned models outperform strong baselines by an average $\sim7\%$. Furthermore, plan-tuned models show better generalization capabilities on out-of-domain datasets, with average $\sim10\%$ and $\sim12\%$ performance improvements on OlympiadBench and AIME 2024, respectively. Our detailed analysis demonstrates how planning trajectories improves complex reasoning capabilities, showing that PLAN-TUNING is an effective strategy for improving task-specific performance of smaller LLMs.

Abstract: With widespread adoption of transformer-based language models in AI, there is significant interest in the limits of LLMs capabilities, specifically so-called hallucinations, occurrences in which LLMs provide spurious, factually incorrect or nonsensical information when prompted on certain subjects. Furthermore, there is growing interest in agentic uses of LLMs - that is, using LLMs to create agents that act autonomously or semi-autonomously to carry out various tasks, including tasks with applications in the real world. This makes it important to understand the types of tasks LLMs can and cannot perform. We explore this topic from the perspective of the computational complexity of LLM inference. We show that LLMs are incapable of carrying out computational and agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity, and further that LLMs are incapable of verifying the accuracy of tasks beyond a certain complexity. We present examples of both, then discuss some consequences of this work.

Abstract: The growing need for psychological support due to increasing pressures has exposed the scarcity of relevant datasets, particularly in non-English languages. To address this, we propose a framework that leverages limited real-world data and expert knowledge to fine-tune two large language models: Dialog Generator and Dialog Modifier. The Generator creates large-scale psychological counseling dialogues based on predefined paths, which guide system response strategies and user interactions, forming the basis for effective support. The Modifier refines these dialogues to align with real-world data quality. Through both automated and manual review, we construct the Chinese Psychological support Dialogue Dataset (CPsDD), containing 68K dialogues across 13 groups, 16 psychological problems, 13 causes, and 12 support focuses. Additionally, we introduce the Comprehensive Agent Dialogue Support System (CADSS), where a Profiler analyzes user characteristics, a Summarizer condenses dialogue history, a Planner selects strategies, and a Supporter generates empathetic responses. The experimental results of the Strategy Prediction and Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) tasks demonstrate that CADSS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CPsDD and ESConv datasets.

<title>Neural Concept Verifier: Scaling Prover-Verifier Games via Concept Encodings</title>

Abstract: While Prover-Verifier Games (PVGs) offer a promising path toward verifiability in nonlinear classification models, they have not yet been applied to complex inputs such as high-dimensional images. Conversely, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) effectively translate such data into interpretable concepts but are limited by their reliance on low-capacity linear predictors. In this work, we introduce the Neural Concept Verifier (NCV), a unified framework combining PVGs with concept encodings for interpretable, nonlinear classification in high-dimensional settings. NCV achieves this by utilizing recent minimally supervised concept discovery models to extract structured concept encodings from raw inputs. A prover then selects a subset of these encodings, which a verifier -- implemented as a nonlinear predictor -- uses exclusively for decision-making. Our evaluations show that NCV outperforms CBM and pixel-based PVG classifier baselines on high-dimensional, logically complex datasets and also helps mitigate shortcut behavior. Overall, we demonstrate NCV as a promising step toward performative, verifiable AI.

Abstract: This paper presents a competitive approach to multilingual subjectivity detection using large language models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting. We participated in Task 1: Subjectivity of the CheckThat! 2025 evaluation campaign. We show that LLMs, when paired with carefully designed prompts, can match or outperform fine-tuned smaller language models (SLMs), particularly in noisy or low-quality data settings. Despite experimenting with advanced prompt engineering techniques, such as debating LLMs and various example selection strategies, we found limited benefit beyond well-crafted standard few-shot prompts. Our system achieved top rankings across multiple languages in the CheckThat! 2025 subjectivity detection task, including first place in Arabic and Polish, and top-four finishes in Italian, English, German, and multilingual tracks. Notably, our method proved especially robust on the Arabic dataset, likely due to its resilience to annotation inconsistencies. These findings highlight the effectiveness and adaptability of LLM-based few-shot learning for multilingual sentiment tasks, offering a strong alternative to traditional fine-tuning, particularly when labeled data is scarce or inconsistent.

<title>The Cross-Lingual Cost: Retrieval Biases in RAG over Arabic-English Corpora</title>

Abstract: Cross-lingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a critical capability for retrieving and generating answers across languages. Prior work in this context has mostly focused on generation and relied on benchmarks derived from open-domain sources, most notably Wikipedia. In such settings, retrieval challenges often remain hidden due to language imbalances, overlap with pretraining data, and memorized content. To address this gap, we study Arabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from real-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of languages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently and uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual retrieval behavior.
  Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual domain-specific scenarios, with significant performance drops occurring when the user query and supporting document languages differ. A key insight is that these failures stem primarily from the retriever's difficulty in ranking documents across languages. Finally, we propose a simple retrieval strategy that addresses this source of failure by enforcing equal retrieval from both languages, resulting in substantial improvements in cross-lingual and overall performance. These results highlight meaningful opportunities for improving multilingual retrieval, particularly in practical, real-world RAG applications.

Abstract: The accelerating growth of photographic collections has outpaced manual cataloguing, motivating the use of vision language models (VLMs) to automate metadata generation. This study examines whether Al-generated catalogue descriptions can approximate human-written quality and how generative Al might integrate into cataloguing workflows in archival and museum collections. A VLM (InternVL2) generated catalogue descriptions for photographic prints on labelled cardboard mounts with archaeological content, evaluated by archive and archaeology experts and non-experts in a human-centered, experimental framework. Participants classified descriptions as AI-generated or expert-written, rated quality, and reported willingness to use and trust in AI tools. Classification performance was above chance level, with both groups underestimating their ability to detect Al-generated descriptions. OCR errors and hallucinations limited perceived quality, yet descriptions rated higher in accuracy and usefulness were harder to classify, suggesting that human review is necessary to ensure the accuracy and quality of catalogue descriptions generated by the out-of-the-box model, particularly in specialized domains like archaeological cataloguing. Experts showed lower willingness to adopt AI tools, emphasizing concerns on preservation responsibility over technical performance. These findings advocate for a collaborative approach where AI supports draft generation but remains subordinate to human verification, ensuring alignment with curatorial values (e.g., provenance, transparency). The successful integration of this approach depends not only on technical advancements, such as domain-specific fine-tuning, but even more on establishing trust among professionals, which could both be fostered through a transparent and explainable AI pipeline.

Abstract: Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT) aims to translate text within document images, facing generalization challenges due to limited training data and the complex interplay between visual and textual information. To address these challenges, we introduce M4Doc, a novel single-to-mix modality alignment framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). M4Doc aligns an image-only encoder with the multimodal representations of an MLLM, pre-trained on large-scale document image datasets. This alignment enables a lightweight DIMT model to learn crucial visual-textual correlations during training. During inference, M4Doc bypasses the MLLM, maintaining computational efficiency while benefiting from its multimodal knowledge. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in translation quality, especially in cross-domain generalization and challenging document image scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel few-shot cross-domain anomaly detection framework, Nexus Vision Transformer for Anomaly Detection (NexViTAD), based on vision foundation models, which effectively addresses domain-shift challenges in industrial anomaly detection through innovative shared subspace projection mechanisms and multi-task learning (MTL) module. The main innovations include: (1) a hierarchical adapter module that adaptively fuses complementary features from Hiera and DINO-v2 pre-trained models, constructing more robust feature representations; (2) a shared subspace projection strategy that enables effective cross-domain knowledge transfer through bottleneck dimension constraints and skip connection mechanisms; (3) a MTL Decoder architecture supports simultaneous processing of multiple source domains, significantly enhancing model generalization capabilities; (4) an anomaly score inference method based on Sinkhorn-K-means clustering, combined with Gaussian filtering and adaptive threshold processing for precise pixel level. Valuated on the MVTec AD dataset, NexViTAD delivers state-of-the-art performance with an AUC of 97.5%, AP of 70.4%, and PRO of 95.2% in the target domains, surpassing other recent models, marking a transformative advance in cross-domain defect detection.

Abstract: We reveal a hidden Bayesian core of discrete-diffusion language models by showing that the expected denoiser output under the forward masking distribution recovers the exact posterior over clean tokens. Under minimal assumptions, Monte Carlo marginalization over K independent corruptions converges to this posterior at rate O(1/sqrt(K)), yielding a simple proof of consistency and finite-sample error bounds. Building on this insight, we introduce a lightweight inference-time ensemble that averages K mask-and-denoise passes to obtain posterior-aware token probabilities and uncertainty estimates at no extra training cost. On WikiText-2, our method achieves test perplexity 8.8 with K=8, versus 20.3 for GPT-2 Small, despite using a model of comparable size. Code is available at https://github.com/mercury0100/bayesradd.

<title>TransformEEG: Towards Improving Model Generalizability in Deep Learning-based EEG Parkinson's Disease Detection</title>

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is establishing itself as an important, low-cost, noninvasive diagnostic tool for the early detection of Parkinson's Disease (PD). In this context, EEG-based Deep Learning (DL) models have shown promising results due to their ability to discover highly nonlinear patterns within the signal. However, current state-of-the-art DL models suffer from poor generalizability caused by high inter-subject variability. This high variability underscores the need for enhancing model generalizability by developing new architectures better tailored to EEG data. This paper introduces TransformEEG, a hybrid Convolutional-Transformer designed for Parkinson's disease detection using EEG data. Unlike transformer models based on the EEGNet structure, TransformEEG incorporates a depthwise convolutional tokenizer. This tokenizer is specialized in generating tokens composed by channel-specific features, which enables more effective feature mixing within the self-attention layers of the transformer encoder. To evaluate the proposed model, four public datasets comprising 290 subjects (140 PD patients, 150 healthy controls) were harmonized and aggregated. A 10-outer, 10-inner Nested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out (N-LNSO) cross-validation was performed to provide an unbiased comparison against seven other consolidated EEG deep learning models. TransformEEG achieved the highest balanced accuracy's median (78.45%) as well as the lowest interquartile range (6.37%) across all the N-LNSO partitions. When combined with data augmentation and threshold correction, median accuracy increased to 80.10%, with an interquartile range of 5.74%. In conclusion, TransformEEG produces more consistent and less skewed results. It demonstrates a substantial reduction in variability and more reliable PD detection using EEG data compared to the other investigated models.

<title>Learning Pole Structures of Hadronic States using Predictive Uncertainty Estimation</title>

Abstract: Matching theoretical predictions to experimental data remains a central challenge in hadron spectroscopy. In particular, the identification of new hadronic states is difficult, as exotic signals near threshold can arise from a variety of physical mechanisms. A key diagnostic in this context is the pole structure of the scattering amplitude, but different configurations can produce similar signatures. The mapping between pole configurations and line shapes is especially ambiguous near the mass threshold, where analytic control is limited. In this work, we introduce an uncertainty-aware machine learning approach for classifying pole structures in $S$-matrix elements. Our method is based on an ensemble of classifier chains that provide both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimates. We apply a rejection criterion based on predictive uncertainty, achieving a validation accuracy of nearly $95\%$ while discarding only a small fraction of high-uncertainty predictions. Trained on synthetic data with known pole structures, the model generalizes to previously unseen experimental data, including enhancements associated with the $P_{c\bar{c}}(4312)^+$ state observed by LHCb. In this, we infer a four-pole structure, representing the presence of a genuine compact pentaquark in the presence of a higher channel virtual state pole with non-vanishing width. While evaluated on this particular state, our framework is broadly applicable to other candidate hadronic states and offers a scalable tool for pole structure inference in scattering amplitudes.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities by integrating pre-trained vision encoders with large language models (LLMs). Similar to single-modal LLMs, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has been adapted for LVLMs to enhance multi-modal reasoning by generating intermediate rationales based on visual and textual inputs. While CoT is assumed to improve grounding and accuracy in LVLMs, our experiments reveal a key challenge: existing LVLMs often ignore the contents of generated rationales in CoT reasoning. To address this, we re-formulate multi-modal CoT reasoning as a KL-constrained reward maximization focused on rationale-conditional log-likelihood. As the optimal solution, we propose rationale-enhanced decoding (RED), a novel plug-and-play inference-time decoding strategy. RED harmonizes visual and rationale information by multiplying distinct image-conditional and rationale-conditional next token distributions. Extensive experiments show that RED consistently and significantly improves reasoning over standard CoT and other decoding methods across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs. Our work offers a practical and effective approach to improve both the faithfulness and accuracy of CoT reasoning in LVLMs, paving the way for more reliable rationale-grounded multi-modal systems.

Abstract: Fine-tuning is an immensely resource-intensive process when retraining Large Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate a larger body of knowledge. Although many fine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational cost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and complexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is needed. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by storing external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to support question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face significant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper introduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome these limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text summarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework also includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data, significantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the MultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document corpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable improvements over common naive RAG implementations. K2RAG achieved the highest mean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile (Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers. In addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The summarization step reduced the average training time of individual components by 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge graph-based RAG systems. K2RAG also demonstrated superior scalability, requiring three times less VRAM than several naive RAG implementations tested in this study.

Abstract: Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs) are increasingly used for load manipulation tasks involving predefined toolpaths with intermediate stops. At each stop, where the platform maintains a fixed pose and the motors keep the cables under tension, the system must evaluate whether it is safe to proceed by detecting anomalies that could compromise performance (e.g., wind gusts or cable impacts). This paper investigates whether anomalies can be detected using only motor torque data, without additional sensors. It introduces an adaptive, unsupervised outlier detection algorithm based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to identify anomalies from torque signals. The method starts with a brief calibration period, just a few seconds, during which a GMM is fit on known anomaly-free data. Real-time torque measurements are then evaluated using Mahalanobis distance from the GMM, with statistically derived thresholds triggering anomaly flags. Model parameters are periodically updated using the latest segments identified as anomaly-free to adapt to changing conditions. Validation includes 14 long-duration test sessions simulating varied wind intensities. The proposed method achieves a 100% true positive rate and 95.4% average true negative rate, with 1-second detection latency. Comparative evaluation against power threshold and non-adaptive GMM methods indicates higher robustness to drift and environmental variation.

Abstract: Post-training alignment of large language models (LLMs) is a critical challenge, as not all tokens contribute equally to model performance. This paper introduces a selective alignment strategy that prioritizes high-impact tokens within preference pairs, leveraging token-level log-probability differences between the current policy and a reference model. By focusing on these informative tokens, our approach reduces computational overhead and enhances alignment fidelity. We further explore the role of reference model quality, demonstrating that stronger reference models significantly improve token selection accuracy and overall optimization effectiveness. Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks such as Arena-Hard and MT-Bench validate the superiority of our Selective-DPO method over standard DPO and distillation-based baselines. Our findings highlight the importance of token-level optimization and reference model selection in advancing preference alignment for LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/Dongzhijin/SDPO.

Abstract: This paper establishes the first comprehensive review of Large Language Models (LLMs) applied within the legal domain. It pioneers an innovative dual lens taxonomy that integrates legal reasoning frameworks and professional ontologies to systematically unify historical research and contemporary breakthroughs. Transformer-based LLMs, which exhibit emergent capabilities such as contextual reasoning and generative argumentation, surmount traditional limitations by dynamically capturing legal semantics and unifying evidence reasoning. Significant progress is documented in task generalization, reasoning formalization, workflow integration, and addressing core challenges in text processing, knowledge integration, and evaluation rigor via technical innovations like sparse attention mechanisms and mixture-of-experts architectures. However, widespread adoption of LLM introduces critical challenges: hallucination, explainability deficits, jurisdictional adaptation difficulties, and ethical asymmetry. This review proposes a novel taxonomy that maps legal roles to NLP subtasks and computationally implements the Toulmin argumentation framework, thus systematizing advances in reasoning, retrieval, prediction, and dispute resolution. It identifies key frontiers including low-resource systems, multimodal evidence integration, and dynamic rebuttal handling. Ultimately, this work provides both a technical roadmap for researchers and a conceptual framework for practitioners navigating the algorithmic future, laying a robust foundation for the next era of legal artificial intelligence. We have created a GitHub repository to index the relevant papers: https://github.com/Kilimajaro/LLMs_Meet_Law.

Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to remove the influence of particular data or class from trained models to meet privacy, legal, or ethical requirements. Existing unlearning methods tend to forget shallowly: phenomenon of an unlearned model pretend to forget by adjusting only the model response, while its internal representations retain information sufficiently to restore the forgotten data or behavior. We empirically confirm the widespread shallowness by reverting the forgetting effect of various unlearning methods via training-free performance recovery attack and gradient-inversion-based data reconstruction attack. To address this vulnerability fundamentally, we define a theoretical criterion of ``deep forgetting'' based on one-point-contraction of feature representations of data to forget. We also propose an efficient approximation algorithm, and use it to construct a novel general-purpose unlearning algorithm: One-Point-Contraction (OPC). Empirical evaluations on image classification unlearning benchmarks show that OPC achieves not only effective unlearning performance but also superior resilience against both performance recovery attack and gradient-inversion attack. The distinctive unlearning performance of OPC arises from the deep feature forgetting enforced by its theoretical foundation, and recaps the need for improved robustness of machine unlearning methods.

Abstract: Generalizing neural networks to unseen target domains is a significant challenge in real-world deployments. Test-time training (TTT) addresses this by using an auxiliary self-supervised task to reduce the domain gap caused by distribution shifts between the source and target. However, we find that when models are required to perform multiple tasks under domain shifts, conventional TTT methods suffer from unsynchronized task behavior, where the adaptation steps needed for optimal performance in one task may not align with the requirements of other tasks. To address this, we propose a novel TTT approach called Synchronizing Tasks for Test-time Training (S4T), which enables the concurrent handling of multiple tasks. The core idea behind S4T is that predicting task relations across domain shifts is key to synchronizing tasks during test time. To validate our approach, we apply S4T to conventional multi-task benchmarks, integrating it with traditional TTT protocols. Our empirical results show that S4T outperforms state-of-the-art TTT methods across various benchmarks.

Abstract: We conduct an extensive study on the state of calibration under real-world dataset shift for image classification. Our work provides important insights on the choice of post-hoc and in-training calibration techniques, and yields practical guidelines for all practitioners interested in robust calibration under shift. We compare various post-hoc calibration methods, and their interactions with common in-training calibration strategies (e.g., label smoothing), across a wide range of natural shifts, on eight different classification tasks across several imaging domains. We find that: (i) simultaneously applying entropy regularisation and label smoothing yield the best calibrated raw probabilities under dataset shift, (ii) post-hoc calibrators exposed to a small amount of semantic out-of-distribution data (unrelated to the task) are most robust under shift, (iii) recent calibration methods specifically aimed at increasing calibration under shifts do not necessarily offer significant improvements over simpler post-hoc calibration methods, (iv) improving calibration under shifts often comes at the cost of worsening in-distribution calibration. Importantly, these findings hold for randomly initialised classifiers, as well as for those finetuned from foundation models, the latter being consistently better calibrated compared to models trained from scratch. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of ensembling effects, finding that (i) applying calibration prior to ensembling (instead of after) is more effective for calibration under shifts, (ii) for ensembles, OOD exposure deteriorates the ID-shifted calibration trade-off, (iii) ensembling remains one of the most effective methods to improve calibration robustness and, combined with finetuning from foundation models, yields best calibration results overall.

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) has emerged as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm for vision transformers, with conventional approaches utilizing dataset-level prompts that remain the same across all input instances. We observe that this strategy results in sub-optimal performance due to high variance in downstream datasets. To address this challenge, we propose Visual Instance-aware Prompt Tuning (ViaPT), which generates instance-aware prompts based on each individual input and fuses them with dataset-level prompts, leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to retain important prompting information. Moreover, we reveal that VPT-Deep and VPT-Shallow represent two corner cases based on a conceptual understanding, in which they fail to effectively capture instance-specific information, while random dimension reduction on prompts only yields performance between the two extremes. Instead, ViaPT overcomes these limitations by balancing dataset-level and instance-level knowledge, while reducing the amount of learnable parameters compared to VPT-Deep. Extensive experiments across 34 diverse datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a new paradigm for analyzing and optimizing visual prompts for vision transformers.

<title>Bridging Logic and Learning: Decoding Temporal Logic Embeddings via Transformers</title>

Abstract: Continuous representations of logic formulae allow us to integrate symbolic knowledge into data-driven learning algorithms. If such embeddings are semantically consistent, i.e. if similar specifications are mapped into nearby vectors, they enable continuous learning and optimization directly in the semantic space of formulae. However, to translate the optimal continuous representation into a concrete requirement, such embeddings must be invertible. We tackle this issue by training a Transformer-based decoder-only model to invert semantic embeddings of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. STL is a powerful formalism that allows us to describe properties of signals varying over time in an expressive yet concise way. By constructing a small vocabulary from STL syntax, we demonstrate that our proposed model is able to generate valid formulae after only 1 epoch and to generalize to the semantics of the logic in about 10 epochs. Additionally, the model is able to decode a given embedding into formulae that are often simpler in terms of length and nesting while remaining semantically close (or equivalent) to gold references. We show the effectiveness of our methodology across various levels of training formulae complexity to assess the impact of training data on the model's ability to effectively capture the semantic information contained in the embeddings and generalize out-of-distribution. Finally, we deploy our model for solving a requirement mining task, i.e. inferring STL specifications that solve a classification task on trajectories, performing the optimization directly in the semantic space.

<title>On the Effect of Instruction Tuning Loss on Generalization</title>

Abstract: Instruction Tuning has emerged as a pivotal post-training paradigm that enables pre-trained language models to better follow user instructions. Despite its significance, little attention has been given to optimizing the loss function used. A fundamental, yet often overlooked, question is whether the conventional auto-regressive objective - where loss is computed only on response tokens, excluding prompt tokens - is truly optimal for instruction tuning. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of differentially weighting prompt and response tokens in instruction tuning loss, and propose Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT) as a better alternative to conventional instruction tuning. Through extensive experiments on five language models of different families and scale, three finetuning datasets of different sizes, and five diverse evaluation benchmarks, we show that the standard instruction tuning loss often yields suboptimal performance and limited robustness to input prompt variations. We find that a low-to-moderate weight for prompt tokens coupled with a moderate-to-high weight for response tokens yields the best-performing models across settings and also serve as better starting points for the subsequent preference alignment training. These findings highlight the need to reconsider instruction tuning loss and offer actionable insights for developing more robust and generalizable models. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/kowndinya-renduchintala/WIT.

Abstract: Content-based puzzle solvers have been extensively studied, demonstrating significant progress in computational techniques. However, their evaluation often lacks realistic challenges crucial for real-world applications, such as the reassembly of fragmented artefacts or shredded documents. In this work, we investigate the robustness of State-Of-The-Art content-based puzzle solvers introducing three types of jigsaw puzzle corruptions: missing pieces, eroded edges, and eroded contents. Evaluating both heuristic and deep learning-based solvers, we analyse their ability to handle these corruptions and identify key limitations. Our results show that solvers developed for standard puzzles have a rapid decline in performance if more pieces are corrupted. However, deep learning models can significantly improve their robustness through fine-tuning with augmented data. Notably, the advanced Positional Diffusion model adapts particularly well, outperforming its competitors in most experiments. Based on our findings, we highlight promising research directions for enhancing the automated reconstruction of real-world artefacts.

<title>From Ambiguity to Accuracy: The Transformative Effect of Coreference Resolution on Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial framework in natural language processing (NLP), improving factual consistency and reducing hallucinations by integrating external document retrieval with large language models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of RAG is often hindered by coreferential complexity in retrieved documents, introducing ambiguity that disrupts in-context learning. In this study, we systematically investigate how entity coreference affects both document retrieval and generative performance in RAG-based systems, focusing on retrieval relevance, contextual understanding, and overall response quality. We demonstrate that coreference resolution enhances retrieval effectiveness and improves question-answering (QA) performance. Through comparative analysis of different pooling strategies in retrieval tasks, we find that mean pooling demonstrates superior context capturing ability after applying coreference resolution. In QA tasks, we discover that smaller models benefit more from the disambiguation process, likely due to their limited inherent capacity for handling referential ambiguity. With these findings, this study aims to provide a deeper understanding of the challenges posed by coreferential complexity in RAG, providing guidance for improving retrieval and generation in knowledge-intensive AI applications.

Abstract: Variational inference with natural-gradient descent often shows fast convergence in practice, but its theoretical convergence guarantees have been challenging to establish. This is true even for the simplest cases that involve concave log-likelihoods and use a Gaussian approximation. We show that the challenge can be circumvented for such cases using a square-root parameterization for the Gaussian covariance. This approach establishes novel convergence guarantees for natural-gradient variational-Gaussian inference and its continuous-time gradient flow. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of natural gradient methods and highlight their advantages over algorithms that use Euclidean or Wasserstein geometries.

arXiv:2507.07868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper extends the self-referential framework of Alpay Algebra into a multi-layered semantic game architecture where transfinite fixed-point convergence encompasses hierarchical sub-games at each iteration level. Building upon Alpay Algebra IV's empathetic embedding concept, we introduce a nested game-theoretic structure where the alignment process between AI systems and documents becomes a meta-game containing embedded decision problems. We formalize this through a composite operator $\phi(\cdot, \gamma(\cdot))$ where $\phi$ drives the main semantic convergence while $\gamma$ resolves local sub-games. The resulting framework demonstrates that game-theoretic reasoning emerges naturally from fixed-point iteration rather than being imposed externally. We prove a Game Theorem establishing existence and uniqueness of semantic equilibria under realistic cognitive simulation assumptions. Our verification suite includes adaptations of Banach's fixed-point theorem to transfinite contexts, a novel $\phi$-topology based on the Kozlov-Maz'ya-Rossmann formula for handling semantic singularities, and categorical consistency tests via the Yoneda lemma. The paper itself functions as a semantic artifact designed to propagate its fixed-point patterns in AI embedding spaces -- a deliberate instantiation of the "semantic virus" concept it theorizes. All results are grounded in category theory, information theory, and realistic AI cognition models, ensuring practical applicability beyond pure mathematical abstraction.

<title>Mitigating Watermark Stealing Attacks in Generative Models via Multi-Key Watermarking</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Watermarking offers a promising solution for GenAI providers to establish the provenance of their generated content. A watermark is a hidden signal embedded in the generated content, whose presence can later be verified using a secret watermarking key. A threat to GenAI providers are \emph{watermark stealing} attacks, where users forge a watermark into content that was \emph{not} generated by the provider's models without access to the secret key, e.g., to falsely accuse the provider. Stealing attacks collect \emph{harmless} watermarked samples from the provider's model and aim to maximize the expected success rate of generating \emph{harmful} watermarked samples. Our work focuses on mitigating stealing attacks while treating the underlying watermark as a black-box. Our contributions are: (i) Proposing a multi-key extension to mitigate stealing attacks that can be applied post-hoc to any watermarking method across any modality. (ii) We provide theoretical guarantees and demonstrate empirically that our method makes forging substantially less effective across multiple datasets, and (iii) we formally define the threat of watermark forging as the task of generating harmful, watermarked content and model this threat via security games.

Abstract: Existing pruning methods are typically applied during training or compile time and often rely on structured sparsity. While compatible with low-power microcontrollers (MCUs), structured pruning underutilizes the opportunity for fine-grained efficiency on devices without SIMD support or parallel compute. To address these limitations, we introduce UnIT (Unstructured Inference-Time pruning), a lightweight method that dynamically identifies and skips unnecessary multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations during inference, guided by input-specific activation patterns. Unlike structured pruning, UnIT embraces irregular sparsity and does not require retraining or hardware specialization. It transforms pruning decisions into lightweight comparisons, replacing multiplications with threshold checks and approximated divisions. UnIT further optimizes compute by reusing threshold computations across multiple connections and applying layer- and group-specific pruning sensitivity. We present three fast, hardware-friendly division approximations tailored to the capabilities of common embedded platforms. Demonstrated on the MSP430 microcontroller, UnIT achieves 11.02% to 82.03% MAC reduction, 27.30% to 84.19% faster inference, and 27.33% to 84.38% lower energy consumption compared to training-time pruned models, while maintaining accuracy with 0.48-7%. Under domain shift, UnIT matches or exceeds the accuracy of retrained models while requiring significantly fewer MACs. These results establish unstructured inference-time pruning as a viable and practical solution for efficient, retraining-free deployment of deep neural networks on MCUs.

Abstract: Tracking the strategic focus of companies through topics in their earnings calls is a key task in financial analysis. However, as industries evolve, traditional topic modeling techniques struggle to dynamically capture emerging topics and their relationships. In this work, we propose an LLM-agent driven approach to discover and retrieve emerging topics from quarterly earnings calls. We propose an LLM-agent to extract topics from documents, structure them into a hierarchical ontology, and establish relationships between new and existing topics through a topic ontology. We demonstrate the use of extracted topics to infer company-level insights and emerging trends over time. We evaluate our approach by measuring ontology coherence, topic evolution accuracy, and its ability to surface emerging financial trends.

Abstract: The explosive growth of textual data over time presents a significant challenge in uncovering evolving themes and trends. Existing dynamic topic modeling techniques, while powerful, often exist in fragmented pipelines that lack robust support for interpretation and user-friendly exploration. We introduce DTECT (Dynamic Topic Explorer & Context Tracker), an end-to-end system that bridges the gap between raw textual data and meaningful temporal insights. DTECT provides a unified workflow that supports data preprocessing, multiple model architectures, and dedicated evaluation metrics to analyze the topic quality of temporal topic models. It significantly enhances interpretability by introducing LLM-driven automatic topic labeling, trend analysis via temporally salient words, interactive visualizations with document-level summarization, and a natural language chat interface for intuitive data querying. By integrating these features into a single, cohesive platform, DTECT empowers users to more effectively track and understand thematic dynamics. DTECT is open-source and available at https://github.com/AdhyaSuman/DTECT.

Abstract: Continuous, automated monitoring of laboratory mice enables more accurate data collection and improves animal welfare through real-time insights. Researchers can achieve a more dynamic and clinically relevant characterization of disease progression and therapeutic effects by integrating behavioral and physiological monitoring in the home cage. However, providing individual mouse metrics is difficult because of their housing density, similar appearances, high mobility, and frequent interactions. To address these challenges, we develop a real-time identification (ID) algorithm that accurately assigns ID predictions to mice wearing custom ear tags in digital home cages monitored by cameras. Our pipeline consists of three parts: (1) a custom multiple object tracker (MouseTracks) that combines appearance and motion cues from mice; (2) a transformer-based ID classifier (Mouseformer); and (3) a tracklet associator linear program to assign final ID predictions to tracklets (MouseMap). Our models assign an animal ID based on custom ear tags at 30 frames per second with 24/7 cage coverage. We show that our custom tracking and ID pipeline improves tracking efficiency and lowers ID switches across mouse strains and various environmental factors compared to current mouse tracking methods.

Abstract: Background: Public speaking is a vital professional skill, yet it remains a source of significant anxiety for many individuals. Traditional training relies heavily on expert coaching, but recent advances in AI has led to novel types of commercial automated public speaking feedback tools. However, most research has focused on prototypes rather than commercial applications, and little is known about how public speaking experts perceive these tools.
  Objectives: This study aims to evaluate expert opinions on the efficacy and design of commercial AI-based public speaking training tools and to propose guidelines for their improvement.
  Methods: The research involved 16 semi-structured interviews and 2 focus groups with public speaking experts. Participants discussed their views on current commercial tools, their potential integration into traditional coaching, and suggestions for enhancing these systems.
  Results and Conclusions: Experts acknowledged the value of AI tools in handling repetitive, technical aspects of training, allowing coaches to focus on higher-level skills. However they found key issues in current tools, emphasising the need for personalised, understandable, carefully selected feedback and clear instructional design. Overall, they supported a hybrid model combining traditional coaching with AI-supported exercises.

Abstract: The recent advances in generative models such as diffusion models have raised several risks and concerns related to privacy, copyright infringements and data stewardship. To better understand and control the risks, various researchers have created techniques, experiments and attacks that reconstruct images, or part of images, from the training set. While these techniques already establish that data from the training set can be reconstructed, they often rely on high-resources, excess to the training set as well as well-engineered and designed prompts.
  In this work, we devise a new attack that requires low resources, assumes little to no access to the actual training set, and identifies, seemingly, benign prompts that lead to potentially-risky image reconstruction. This highlights the risk that images might even be reconstructed by an uninformed user and unintentionally. For example, we identified that, with regard to one existing model, the prompt ``blue Unisex T-Shirt'' can generate the face of a real-life human model. Our method builds on an intuition from previous works which leverages domain knowledge and identifies a fundamental vulnerability that stems from the use of scraped data from e-commerce platforms, where templated layouts and images are tied to pattern-like prompts.

Abstract: Although memory capabilities of AI agents are gaining increasing attention, existing solutions remain fundamentally limited. Most rely on flat, narrowly scoped memory components, constraining their ability to personalize, abstract, and reliably recall user-specific information over time. To this end, we introduce MIRIX, a modular, multi-agent memory system that redefines the future of AI memory by solving the field's most critical challenge: enabling language models to truly remember. Unlike prior approaches, MIRIX transcends text to embrace rich visual and multimodal experiences, making memory genuinely useful in real-world scenarios. MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured memory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and Knowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls and coordinates updates and retrieval. This design enables agents to persist, reason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We validate MIRIX in two demanding settings. First, on ScreenshotVQA, a challenging multimodal benchmark comprising nearly 20,000 high-resolution computer screenshots per sequence, requiring deep contextual understanding and where no existing memory systems can be applied, MIRIX achieves 35% higher accuracy than the RAG baseline while reducing storage requirements by 99.9%. Second, on LOCOMO, a long-form conversation benchmark with single-modal textual input, MIRIX attains state-of-the-art performance of 85.4%, far surpassing existing baselines. These results show that MIRIX sets a new performance standard for memory-augmented LLM agents. To allow users to experience our memory system, we provide a packaged application powered by MIRIX. It monitors the screen in real time, builds a personalized memory base, and offers intuitive visualization and secure local storage to ensure privacy.

Abstract: We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset, LongVideo-Reason, comprising 52K long video QA pairs with high-quality reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs; (2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for efficient rollout and prefilling. In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves strong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME. It also outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across temporal reasoning, goal and purpose reasoning, spatial reasoning, and plot reasoning on our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to 2.1x speedup on long video RL training. LongVILA-R1 demonstrates consistent performance gains as the number of input video frames scales. LongVILA-R1 marks a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our training system for public availability that supports RL training on various modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k tokens).

arXiv:2507.07969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Q-chunking, a simple yet effective recipe for improving reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks. Our recipe is designed for the offline-to-online RL setting, where the goal is to leverage an offline prior dataset to maximize the sample-efficiency of online learning. Effective exploration and sample-efficient learning remain central challenges in this setting, as it is not obvious how the offline data should be utilized to acquire a good exploratory policy. Our key insight is that action chunking, a technique popularized in imitation learning where sequences of future actions are predicted rather than a single action at each timestep, can be applied to temporal difference (TD)-based RL methods to mitigate the exploration challenge. Q-chunking adopts action chunking by directly running RL in a 'chunked' action space, enabling the agent to (1) leverage temporally consistent behaviors from offline data for more effective online exploration and (2) use unbiased $n$-step backups for more stable and efficient TD learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Q-chunking exhibits strong offline performance and online sample efficiency, outperforming prior best offline-to-online methods on a range of long-horizon, sparse-reward manipulation tasks.

<title>Why is Your Language Model a Poor Implicit Reward Model?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Reward models are key to language model post-training and inference pipelines. Conveniently, recent work showed that every language model defines an implicit reward model (IM-RM), without requiring any architectural changes. However, such IM-RMs tend to generalize worse, especially out-of-distribution, compared to explicit reward models (EX-RMs) that apply a dedicated linear head over the hidden representations of a language model. The existence of a generalization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical. They can be trained using the same data, loss function, and language model, and differ only in how the reward is computed. Towards a fundamental understanding of the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate the root cause of this gap. Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments, is that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently, they often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts, as well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against alternative hypotheses for the generalization gap. Most notably, we challenge the intuitive claim that IM-RMs struggle in tasks where generation is harder than verification because they can operate both as a verifier and a generator. Taken together, our results highlight that seemingly minor design choices can substantially impact the generalization behavior of reward models.

Abstract: Videos inherently represent 2D projections of a dynamic 3D world. However, our analysis suggests that video diffusion models trained solely on raw video data often fail to capture meaningful geometric-aware structure in their learned representations. To bridge this gap between video diffusion models and the underlying 3D nature of the physical world, we propose Geometry Forcing, a simple yet effective method that encourages video diffusion models to internalize latent 3D representations. Our key insight is to guide the model's intermediate representations toward geometry-aware structure by aligning them with features from a pretrained geometric foundation model. To this end, we introduce two complementary alignment objectives: Angular Alignment, which enforces directional consistency via cosine similarity, and Scale Alignment, which preserves scale-related information by regressing unnormalized geometric features from normalized diffusion representation. We evaluate Geometry Forcing on both camera view-conditioned and action-conditioned video generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves visual quality and 3D consistency over the baseline methods. Project page: https://GeometryForcing.github.io.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for supporting clinical decision-making in complex fields such as rheumatology. Our evaluation shows that smaller language models (SLMs), combined with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), achieve higher diagnostic and therapeutic performance than larger models, while requiring substantially less energy and enabling cost-efficient, local deployment. These features are attractive for resource-limited healthcare. However, expert oversight remains essential, as no model consistently reached specialist-level accuracy in rheumatology.

<title>EXPO: Stable Reinforcement Learning with Expressive Policies</title>

Abstract: We study the problem of training and fine-tuning expressive policies with online reinforcement learning (RL) given an offline dataset. Training expressive policy classes with online RL present a unique challenge of stable value maximization. Unlike simpler Gaussian policies commonly used in online RL, expressive policies like diffusion and flow-matching policies are parameterized by a long denoising chain, which hinders stable gradient propagation from actions to policy parameters when optimizing against some value function. Our key insight is that we can address stable value maximization by avoiding direct optimization over value with the expressive policy and instead construct an on-the-fly RL policy to maximize Q-value. We propose Expressive Policy Optimization (EXPO), a sample-efficient online RL algorithm that utilizes an on-the-fly policy to maximize value with two parameterized policies -- a larger expressive base policy trained with a stable imitation learning objective and a light-weight Gaussian edit policy that edits the actions sampled from the base policy toward a higher value distribution. The on-the-fly policy optimizes the actions from the base policy with the learned edit policy and chooses the value maximizing action from the base and edited actions for both sampling and temporal-difference (TD) backup. Our approach yields up to 2-3x improvement in sample efficiency on average over prior methods both in the setting of fine-tuning a pretrained policy given offline data and in leveraging offline data to train online.

Abstract: Video large language models (LLMs) achieve strong video understanding by leveraging a large number of spatio-temporal tokens, but suffer from quadratic computational scaling with token count. To address this, we propose a training-free spatio-temporal token merging method, named STTM. Our key insight is to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has been overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into multi-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree structure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal dimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token reduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a 2$\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and a 3$\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget. Moreover, STTM is query-agnostic, allowing KV cache reuse across different questions for the same video. The project page is available at https://www.jshyun.me/projects/sttm.

Abstract: Existing evaluation protocols for brain visual decoding predominantly rely on coarse metrics that obscure inter-model differences, lack neuroscientific foundation, and fail to capture fine-grained visual distinctions. To address these limitations, we introduce BASIC, a unified, multigranular evaluation framework that jointly quantifies structural fidelity, inferential alignment, and contextual coherence between decoded and ground truth images. For the structural level, we introduce a hierarchical suite of segmentation-based metrics, including foreground, semantic, instance, and component masks, anchored in granularity-aware correspondence across mask structures. For the semantic level, we extract structured scene representations encompassing objects, attributes, and relationships using multimodal large language models, enabling detailed, scalable, and context-rich comparisons with ground-truth stimuli. We benchmark a diverse set of visual decoding methods across multiple stimulus-neuroimaging datasets within this unified evaluation framework. Together, these criteria provide a more discriminative, interpretable, and comprehensive foundation for measuring brain visual decoding methods.

<title>Single-pass Adaptive Image Tokenization for Minimum Program Search</title>

Abstract: According to Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) -- Intelligent representations compress data into the shortest possible program that can reconstruct its content, exhibiting low Kolmogorov Complexity (KC). In contrast, most visual representation learning systems use fixed-length representations for all inputs, ignoring variations in complexity or familiarity. Recent adaptive tokenization methods address this by allocating variable-length representations but typically require test-time search over multiple encodings to find the most predictive one. Inspired by Kolmogorov Complexity principles, we propose a single-pass adaptive tokenizer, KARL, which predicts the appropriate number of tokens for an image in a single forward pass, halting once its approximate KC is reached. The token count serves as a proxy for the minimum description length. KARL's training procedure closely resembles the Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning paradigm, as it learns to conditionally predict token halting based on a desired reconstruction quality. KARL matches the performance of recent adaptive tokenizers while operating in a single pass. We present scaling laws for KARL, analyzing the role of encoder/decoder size, continuous vs. discrete tokenization and more. Additionally, we offer a conceptual study drawing an analogy between Adaptive Image Tokenization and Algorithmic Information Theory, examining the predicted image complexity (KC) across axes such as structure vs. noise and in- vs. out-of-distribution familiarity -- revealing alignment with human intuition.

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, systems capable of planning, reasoning, and dynamically calling external tools. However, in visual reasoning, prior approaches largely remain limited by predefined workflows and static toolsets. In this report, we present PyVision, an interactive, multi-turn framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and refine Python-based tools tailored to the task at hand, unlocking flexible and interpretable problem-solving. We develop a taxonomy of the tools created by PyVision and analyze their usage across a diverse set of benchmarks. Quantitatively, PyVision achieves consistent performance gains, boosting GPT-4.1 by +7.8% on V* and Claude-4.0-Sonnet by +31.1% on VLMsAreBlind-mini. These results point to a broader shift: dynamic tooling allows models not just to use tools, but to invent them, advancing toward more agentic visual reasoning.

Abstract: Models like OpenAI-o3 pioneer visual grounded reasoning by dynamically referencing visual regions, just like human "thinking with images". However, no benchmark exists to evaluate these capabilities holistically. To bridge this gap, we propose TreeBench (Traceable Evidence Evaluation Benchmark), a diagnostic benchmark built on three principles: (1) focused visual perception of subtle targets in complex scenes, (2) traceable evidence via bounding box evaluation, and (3) second-order reasoning to test object interactions and spatial hierarchies beyond simple object localization. Prioritizing images with dense objects, we initially sample 1K high-quality images from SA-1B, and incorporate eight LMM experts to manually annotate questions, candidate options, and answers for each image. After three stages of quality control, TreeBench consists of 405 challenging visual question-answering pairs, even the most advanced models struggle with this benchmark, where none of them reach 60% accuracy, e.g., OpenAI-o3 scores only 54.87. Furthermore, we introduce TreeVGR (Traceable Evidence Enhanced Visual Grounded Reasoning), a training paradigm to supervise localization and reasoning jointly with reinforcement learning, enabling accurate localizations and explainable reasoning pathways. Initialized from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, it improves V* Bench (+16.8), MME-RealWorld (+12.6), and TreeBench (+13.4), proving traceability is key to advancing vision-grounded reasoning. The code is available at https://github.com/Haochen-Wang409/TreeVGR.

Abstract: Interdicting a criminal with limited police resources is a challenging task as the criminal changes location over time. The size of the large transportation network further adds to the difficulty of this scenario. To tackle this issue, we consider the concept of a layered graph. At each time stamp, we create a copy of the entire transportation network to track the possible movements of both players, the attacker and the defenders. We consider a Stackelberg game in a dynamic crime scenario where the attacker changes location over time while the defenders attempt to interdict the attacker on his escape route. Given a set of defender strategies, the optimal attacker strategy is determined by applying Dijkstra's algorithm on the layered networks. Here, the attacker aims to minimize while the defenders aim to maximize the probability of interdiction. We develop an approximation algorithm on the layered networks to find near-optimal strategy for defenders. The efficacy of the developed approach is compared with the adopted MILP approach. We compare the results in terms of computational time and solution quality. The quality of the results demonstrates the need for the developed approach, as it effectively solves the complex problem within a short amount of time.

Abstract: Clinical information extraction, which involves structuring clinical concepts from unstructured medical text, remains a challenging problem that could benefit from the inclusion of tabular background information available in electronic health records. Existing open-source datasets lack explicit links between structured features and clinical concepts in the text, motivating the need for a new research dataset. We introduce SimSUM, a benchmark dataset of 10,000 simulated patient records that link unstructured clinical notes with structured background variables. Each record simulates a patient encounter in the domain of respiratory diseases and includes tabular data (e.g., symptoms, diagnoses, underlying conditions) generated from a Bayesian network whose structure and parameters are defined by domain experts. A large language model (GPT-4o) is prompted to generate a clinical note describing the encounter, including symptoms and relevant context. These notes are annotated with span-level symptom mentions. We conduct an expert evaluation to assess note quality and run baseline predictive models on both the tabular and textual data. The SimSUM dataset is primarily designed to support research on clinical information extraction in the presence of tabular background variables, which can be linked through domain knowledge to concepts of interest to be extracted from the text (symptoms, in the case of SimSUM). Secondary uses include research on the automation of clinical reasoning over both tabular data and text, causal effect estimation in the presence of tabular and/or textual confounders, and multi-modal synthetic data generation. SimSUM is not intended for training clinical decision support systems or production-grade models, but rather to facilitate reproducible research in a simplified and controlled setting. The dataset is available at https://github.com/prabaey/SimSUM.

Abstract: Multi-modal generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) has attracted increasing attention from both academia and industry. Particularly, two dominant families of techniques have emerged: i) Multi-modal large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive ability for multi-modal understanding; and ii) Diffusion models exhibit remarkable multi-modal powers in terms of multi-modal generation. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of multi-modal generative AI, including multi-modal LLMs, diffusions, and the unification for understanding and generation. To lay a solid foundation for unified models, we first provide a detailed review of both multi-modal LLMs and diffusion models respectively, including their probabilistic modeling procedure, multi-modal architecture design, and advanced applications to image/video LLMs as well as text-to-image/video generation. Furthermore, we explore the emerging efforts toward unified models for understanding and generation. To achieve the unification of understanding and generation, we investigate key designs including autoregressive-based and diffusion-based modeling, as well as dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We then introduce several strategies for unified models, analyzing their potential advantages and disadvantages. In addition, we summarize the common datasets widely used for multi-modal generative AI pretraining. Last but not least, we present several challenging future research directions which may contribute to the ongoing advancement of multi-modal generative AI.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences remains a key challenge. While post-training techniques like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have achieved notable success, they often introduce computational inefficiencies and training instability. In this paper, we propose Feature-level constrained Preference Optimization (FPO), a novel method designed to simplify the alignment process while ensuring stability. FPO leverages pre-trained Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and introduces feature-level constraints, allowing for efficient, sparsity-enforced alignment. Our approach enjoys efficiency by using sparse features activated in a well-trained sparse autoencoder and the quality of sequential KL divergence by using the feature-level offline reference. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FPO achieves a 5.08% absolute improvement in win rate with much lower computational cost compared to state-of-the-art baselines, making it a promising solution for efficient and controllable LLM alignments.

Abstract: Ensuring ethical behavior in Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems amidst their increasing ubiquity and influence is a major concern the world over. The use of formal methods in AI ethics is a possible crucial approach for specifying and verifying the ethical behavior of AI systems. This paper proposes a formalization based on deontic logic to define and evaluate the ethical behavior of AI systems, focusing on system-level specifications, contributing to this important goal. It introduces axioms and theorems to capture ethical requirements related to fairness and explainability. The formalization incorporates temporal operators to reason about the ethical behavior of AI systems over time. The authors evaluate the effectiveness of this formalization by assessing the ethics of the real-world COMPAS and loan prediction AI systems. Various ethical properties of the COMPAS and loan prediction systems are encoded using deontic logical formulas, allowing the use of an automated theorem prover to verify whether these systems satisfy the defined properties. The formal verification reveals that both systems fail to fulfill certain key ethical properties related to fairness and non-discrimination, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed formalization in identifying potential ethical issues in real-world AI applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the development of AI assistants capable of performing diverse tasks across domains. However, current state-of-the-art LLM-driven agents face significant challenges, including high operational costs and limited success rates on complex benchmarks like GAIA. To address these issues, we propose Knowledge Graph of Thoughts (KGoT), an innovative AI assistant architecture that integrates LLM reasoning with dynamically constructed knowledge graphs (KGs). KGoT extracts and structures task-relevant knowledge into a dynamic KG representation, iteratively enhanced through external tools such as math solvers, web crawlers, and Python scripts. Such structured representation of task-relevant knowledge enables low-cost models to solve complex tasks effectively while also minimizing bias and noise. For example, KGoT achieves a 29% improvement in task success rates on the GAIA benchmark compared to Hugging Face Agents with GPT-4o mini. Moreover, harnessing a smaller model dramatically reduces operational costs by over 36x compared to GPT-4o. Improvements for other models (e.g., Qwen2.5-32B and Deepseek-R1-70B) and benchmarks (e.g., SimpleQA) are similar. KGoT offers a scalable, affordable, versatile, and high-performing solution for AI assistants.

Abstract: The integration of emerging uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) with artificial intelligence (AI) and ground-embedded robots (GERs) has transformed emergency rescue operations in unknown environments. However, the high computational demands often exceed a single UAV's capacity, making it difficult to continuously provide stable high-level services. To address this, this paper proposes a cooperation framework involving UAVs, GERs, and airships. The framework enables resource pooling through UAV-to-GER (U2G) and UAV-to-airship (U2A) links, offering computing services for offloaded tasks. Specifically, we formulate the multi-objective problem of task assignment and exploration as a dynamic long-term optimization problem aiming to minimize task completion time and energy use while ensuring stability. Using Lyapunov optimization, we transform it into a per-slot deterministic problem and propose HG-MADDPG, which combines the Hungarian algorithm with a GDM-based multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient. Simulations demonstrate significant improvements in offloading efficiency, latency, and system stability over baselines.

Abstract: AI safety systems face the dual-use dilemma: it can be unclear whether to refuse certain requests, since they could be either harmless or harmful depending on who made them and why. Determining this requires examining their real-world context, but current safety systems cannot access this contextual information. Instead, they make arbitrary decisions that end up hurting both utility and safety: they sometimes refuse legitimate queries and other times fail to refuse harmful ones. To address this, we propose a conceptual framework based on access controls in which only verified users can access dual-use outputs. We describe the framework's components, analyse its feasibility, and explain how it addresses both over-refusals and under-refusals. While only a high-level proposal, our work takes the first step toward enabling more nuanced safety decisions: with better tools for managing dual-use content, model providers could enable users to access more capabilities without sacrificing safety, and give regulators new options for more targeted policies.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reframed as a cognitive engine driving a novel productivity revolution distinct from the Industrial Revolution's physical thrust. This paper develops a theoretical framing of AI as a cognitive revolution akin to written language - a transformative augmentation of human intellect rather than another mechanized tool. We compare AI's emergence to historical leaps in information technology to show how it amplifies knowledge work. Examples from various domains demonstrate AI's impact as a driver of productivity in cognitive tasks. We adopt a multidisciplinary perspective combining computer science advances with economic insights and sociological perspectives on how AI reshapes work and society. Through conceptual frameworks, we visualize the shift from manual to cognitive productivity. Our central argument is that AI functions as an engine of cognition - comparable to how human language revolutionized knowledge - heralding a new productivity paradigm. We discuss how this revolution demands rethinking of skills, organizations, and policies. This paper, balancing academic rigor with clarity, concludes that AI's promise lies in complementing human cognitive abilities, marking a new chapter in productivity evolution.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive five-stage evolutionary framework for understanding the development of artificial intelligence, arguing that its trajectory mirrors the historical progression of human cognitive technologies. We posit that AI is advancing through distinct epochs, each defined by a revolutionary shift in its capacity for representation and reasoning, analogous to the inventions of cuneiform, the alphabet, grammar and logic, mathematical calculus, and formal logical systems. This "Geometry of Cognition" framework moves beyond mere metaphor to provide a systematic, cross-disciplinary model that not only explains AI's past architectural shifts-from expert systems to Transformers-but also charts a concrete and prescriptive path forward. Crucially, we demonstrate that this evolution is not merely linear but reflexive: as AI advances through these stages, the tools and insights it develops create a feedback loop that fundamentally reshapes its own underlying architecture. We are currently transitioning into a "Metalinguistic Moment," characterized by the emergence of self-reflective capabilities like Chain-of-Thought prompting and Constitutional AI. The subsequent stages, the "Mathematical Symbolism Moment" and the "Formal Logic System Moment," will be defined by the development of a computable calculus of thought, likely through neuro-symbolic architectures and program synthesis, culminating in provably aligned and reliable AI that reconstructs its own foundational representations. This work serves as the methodological capstone to our trilogy, which previously explored the economic drivers ("why") and cognitive nature ("what") of AI. Here, we address the "how," providing a theoretical foundation for future research and offering concrete, actionable strategies for startups and developers aiming to build the next generation of intelligent systems.

Abstract: Can machines truly think, reason and act in domains like humans? This enduring question continues to shape the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Despite the growing capabilities of models such as GPT-4.5, DeepSeek, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Phi-4, and Grok 3, which exhibit multimodal fluency and partial reasoning, these systems remain fundamentally limited by their reliance on token-level prediction and lack of grounded agency. This paper offers a cross-disciplinary synthesis of AGI development, spanning artificial intelligence, cognitive neuroscience, psychology, generative models, and agent-based systems. We analyze the architectural and cognitive foundations of general intelligence, highlighting the role of modular reasoning, persistent memory, and multi-agent coordination. In particular, we emphasize the rise of Agentic RAG frameworks that combine retrieval, planning, and dynamic tool use to enable more adaptive behavior. We discuss generalization strategies, including information compression, test-time adaptation, and training-free methods, as critical pathways toward flexible, domain-agnostic intelligence. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are reexamined not just as perception modules but as evolving interfaces for embodied understanding and collaborative task completion. We also argue that true intelligence arises not from scale alone but from the integration of memory and reasoning: an orchestration of modular, interactive, and self-improving components where compression enables adaptive behavior. Drawing on advances in neurosymbolic systems, reinforcement learning, and cognitive scaffolding, we explore how recent architectures begin to bridge the gap between statistical learning and goal-directed cognition. Finally, we identify key scientific, technical, and ethical challenges on the path to AGI.

Abstract: We present an algorithm for solving binary classification problems when the dataset is not fully representative of the problem being solved, and obtaining more data is not possible. It relies on a trained model with loose accuracy constraints, an iterative hyperparameter searching-and-pruning procedure over a search space $\Theta$, and a data-generating function. Our algorithm works by reconstructing up to homology the manifold on which lies the support of the underlying distribution. We provide an analysis on correctness and runtime complexity under ideal conditions and an extension to deep neural networks. In the former case, if $\size{\Theta}$ is the number of hyperparameter sets in the search space, this algorithm returns a solution that is up to $2(1 - {2^{-\size{\Theta}}})$ times better than simply training with an enumeration of $\Theta$ and picking the best model. As part of our analysis we also prove that an open cover of a dataset has the same homology as the manifold on which lies the support of the underlying probability distribution, if and only said dataset is learnable. This latter result acts as a formal argument to explain the effectiveness of data expansion techniques.

Abstract: The correct interpretation of convolutional models is a hard problem for time series data. While saliency methods promise visual validation of predictions for image and language processing, they fall short when applied to time series. These tend to be less intuitive and represent highly diverse data, such as the tool-use time series dataset. Furthermore, saliency methods often generate varied, conflicting explanations, complicating the reliability of these methods. Consequently, a rigorous objective assessment is necessary to establish trust in them. This paper investigates saliency methods on time series data to formulate recommendations for interpreting convolutional models and implements them on the tool-use time series problem. To achieve this, we first employ nine gradient-, propagation-, or perturbation-based post-hoc saliency methods across six varied and complex real-world datasets. Next, we evaluate these methods using five independent metrics to generate recommendations. Subsequently, we implement a case study focusing on tool-use time series using convolutional classification models. Our results validate our recommendations that indicate that none of the saliency methods consistently outperforms others on all metrics, while some are sometimes ahead. Our insights and step-by-step guidelines allow experts to choose suitable saliency methods for a given model and dataset.

Abstract: Automata learning is a successful tool for many application domains such as robotics and automatic verification. Typically, automata learning techniques operate in a supervised learning setting (active or passive) where they learn a finite state machine in contexts where additional information, such as labeled system executions, is available. However, other settings, such as learning from unlabeled data - an important aspect in machine learning - remain unexplored. To overcome this limitation, we propose a framework for learning a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) from a given multi-set of unlabeled words. We show that this problem is computationally hard and develop three learning algorithms based on constraint optimization. Moreover, we introduce novel regularization schemes for our optimization problems that improve the overall interpretability of our DFAs. Using a prototype implementation, we demonstrate practical feasibility in the context of unsupervised anomaly detection.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has revolutionized various domains, offering predictive capabilities in several areas. However, with the increasing accessibility of ML tools, many practitioners, lacking deep ML expertise, adopt a "push the button" approach, utilizing user-friendly interfaces without a thorough understanding of underlying algorithms. While this approach provides convenience, it raises concerns about the reliability of outcomes, leading to challenges such as incorrect performance evaluation. This paper addresses a critical issue in ML, known as data leakage, where unintended information contaminates the training data, impacting model performance evaluation. Users, due to a lack of understanding, may inadvertently overlook crucial steps, leading to optimistic performance estimates that may not hold in real-world scenarios. The discrepancy between evaluated and actual performance on new data is a significant concern. In particular, this paper categorizes data leakage in ML, discussing how certain conditions can propagate through the ML workflow. Furthermore, it explores the connection between data leakage and the specific task being addressed, investigates its occurrence in Transfer Learning, and compares standard inductive ML with transductive ML frameworks. The conclusion summarizes key findings, emphasizing the importance of addressing data leakage for robust and reliable ML applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized in autonomous decision-making, where they sample options from vast action spaces. However, the heuristics that guide this sampling process remain under explored. We study this sampling behavior and show that this underlying heuristics resembles that of human decision-making: comprising a descriptive component (reflecting statistical norm) and a prescriptive component (implicit ideal encoded in the LLM) of a concept. We show that this deviation of a sample from the statistical norm towards a prescriptive component consistently appears in concepts across diverse real-world domains like public health, and economic trends. To further illustrate the theory, we demonstrate that concept prototypes in LLMs are affected by prescriptive norms, similar to the concept of normality in humans. Through case studies and comparison with human studies, we illustrate that in real-world applications, the shift of samples toward an ideal value in LLMs' outputs can result in significantly biased decision-making, raising ethical concerns.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in bridging the gap between natural language queries and database management systems, enabling users to interact with databases without the background of SQL. However, LLMs often struggle to comprehend complex database structures and accurately interpret user intentions. Decomposition-based methods have been proposed to enhance the performance of LLMs on complex tasks, but decomposing SQL generation into subtasks is non-trivial due to the declarative structure of SQL syntax and the intricate connections between query concepts and database elements. In this paper, we propose a novel Structure GUided text-to-SQL framework~(SGU-SQL) that incorporates syntax-based prompting to enhance the SQL generation capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, SGU-SQL establishes structure-aware links between user queries and database schema and decomposes the complex generation task using syntax-based prompting to enable more accurate LLM-based SQL generation. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that SGU-SQL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art text-to-SQL models.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn policies without online explorations. To enlarge the training data, model-based offline RL learns a dynamics model which is utilized as a virtual environment to generate simulation data and enhance policy learning. However, existing data augmentation methods for offline RL suffer from (i) trivial improvement from short-horizon simulation; and (ii) the lack of evaluation and correction for generated data, leading to low-qualified augmentation.
  In this paper, we propose offline trajectory optimization for offline reinforcement learning (OTTO). The key motivation is to conduct long-horizon simulation and then utilize model uncertainty to evaluate and correct the augmented data. Specifically, we propose an ensemble of Transformers, a.k.a. World Transformers, to predict environment state dynamics and the reward function. Three strategies are proposed to use World Transformers to generate long-horizon trajectory simulation by perturbing the actions in the offline data. Then, an uncertainty-based World Evaluator is introduced to firstly evaluate the confidence of the generated trajectories and then perform the correction for low-confidence data. Finally, we jointly use the original data with the corrected augmentation data to train an offline RL algorithm. OTTO serves as a plug-in module and can be integrated with existing model-free offline RL methods. Experiments on various benchmarks show that OTTO can effectively improve the performance of representative offline RL algorithms, including in complex environments with sparse rewards like AntMaze. Codes are available at https://github.com/ZiqiZhao1/OTTO.

Abstract: Probabilistic verification problems of neural networks are concerned with formally analysing the output distribution of a neural network under a probability distribution of the inputs. Examples of probabilistic verification problems include verifying the demographic parity fairness notion or quantifying the safety of a neural network. We present a new algorithm for solving probabilistic verification problems of neural networks based on an algorithm for computing and iteratively refining lower and upper bounds on probabilities over the outputs of a neural network. By applying state-of-the-art bound propagation and branch and bound techniques from non-probabilistic neural network verification, our algorithm significantly outpaces existing probabilistic verification algorithms, reducing solving times for various benchmarks from the literature from tens of minutes to tens of seconds. Furthermore, our algorithm compares favourably even to dedicated algorithms for restricted probabilistic verification problems. We complement our empirical evaluation with a theoretical analysis, proving that our algorithm is sound and, under mildly restrictive conditions, also complete when using a suitable set of heuristics.

arXiv:2406.05085v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling the retrieval of documents into the LLM context to provide more accurate and relevant responses. Existing RAG solutions do not focus on queries that may require fetching multiple documents with substantially different contents. Such queries occur frequently, but are challenging because the embeddings of these documents may be distant in the embedding space, making it hard to retrieve them all. This paper introduces Multi-Head RAG (MRAG), a novel scheme designed to address this gap with a simple yet powerful idea: leveraging activations of Transformer's multi-head attention layer, instead of the decoder layer, as keys for fetching multi-aspect documents. The driving observation is that different attention heads learn to capture different data aspects. Harnessing the corresponding activations results in embeddings that represent various facets of data items and queries, improving the retrieval accuracy for complex queries. We provide an evaluation methodology and metrics, multi-aspect datasets, and real-world use cases to demonstrate MRAG's effectiveness. We show MRAG's design advantages over 18 RAG baselines, empirical improvements of up to 20% in retrieval success ratios, and benefits for downstream LLM generation. MRAG can be seamlessly integrated with existing RAG frameworks and benchmarks.

Abstract: In order to unlock the potential of diverse sensors, we investigate a method to transfer knowledge between time-series modalities using a multimodal \textit{temporal} representation space for Human Activity Recognition (HAR). Specifically, we explore the setting where the modality used in testing has no labeled data during training, which we refer to as Unsupervised Modality Adaptation (UMA). We categorize existing UMA approaches as Student-Teacher or Contrastive Alignment methods. These methods typically compress continuous-time data samples into single latent vectors during alignment, inhibiting their ability to transfer temporal information through real-world temporal distortions. To address this, we introduce Cross-modal Transfer Through Time (C3T), which preserves temporal information during alignment to handle dynamic sensor data better. C3T achieves this by aligning a set of temporal latent vectors across sensing modalities. Our extensive experiments on various camera+IMU datasets demonstrate that C3T outperforms existing methods in UMA by at least 8% in accuracy and shows superior robustness to temporal distortions such as time-shift, misalignment, and dilation. Our findings suggest that C3T has significant potential for developing generalizable models for time-series sensor data, opening new avenues for various multimodal applications.

<title>Curriculum Negative Mining For Temporal Networks</title>

Abstract: Temporal networks are effective in capturing the evolving interactions of networks over time, such as social networks and e-commerce networks. In recent years, researchers have primarily concentrated on developing specific model architectures for Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) in order to improve the representation quality of temporal nodes and edges. However, limited attention has been given to the quality of negative samples during the training of TGNNs. When compared with static networks, temporal networks present two specific challenges for negative sampling: positive sparsity and positive shift. Positive sparsity refers to the presence of a single positive sample amidst numerous negative samples at each timestamp, while positive shift relates to the variations in positive samples across different timestamps. To robustly address these challenges in training TGNNs, we introduce Curriculum Negative Mining (CurNM), a model-aware curriculum learning framework that adaptively adjusts the difficulty of negative samples. Within this framework, we first establish a dynamically updated negative pool that balances random, historical, and hard negatives to address the challenges posed by positive sparsity. Secondly, we implement a temporal-aware negative selection module that focuses on learning from the disentangled factors of recently active edges, thus accurately capturing shifting preferences. Finally, the selected negatives are combined with annealing random negatives to support stable training. Extensive experiments on 12 datasets and 3 TGNNs demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline methods by a significant margin. Additionally, thorough ablation studies and parameter sensitivity experiments verify the usefulness and robustness of our approach.

<title>Time Makes Space: Emergence of Place Fields in Networks Encoding Temporally Continuous Sensory Experiences</title>

Abstract: The vertebrate hippocampus is believed to use recurrent connectivity in area CA3 to support episodic memory recall from partial cues. This brain area also contains place cells, whose location-selective firing fields implement maps supporting spatial memory. Here we show that place cells emerge in networks trained to remember temporally continuous sensory episodes. We model CA3 as a recurrent autoencoder that recalls and reconstructs sensory experiences from noisy and partially occluded observations by agents traversing simulated rooms. The agents move in realistic trajectories modeled from rodents and environments are modeled as high-dimensional sensory experience maps. Training our autoencoder to pattern-complete and reconstruct experiences with a constraint on total activity causes spatially localized firing fields, i.e., place cells, to emerge in the encoding layer. The emergent place fields reproduce key aspects of hippocampal phenomenology: a) remapping (maintenance of and reversion to distinct learned maps in different environments), implemented via repositioning of experience manifolds in the network's hidden layer, b) orthogonality of spatial representations in different arenas, c) robust place field emergence in differently shaped rooms, with single units showing multiple place fields in large or complex spaces, and d) slow representational drift of place fields. We argue that these results arise because continuous traversal of space makes sensory experience temporally continuous. We make testable predictions: a) rapidly changing sensory context will disrupt place fields, b) place fields will form even if recurrent connections are blocked, but reversion to previously learned representations upon remapping will be abolished, c) the dimension of temporally smooth experience sets the dimensionality of place fields, including during virtual navigation of abstract spaces.

arXiv:2408.06687v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we survey recent studies on masked image modeling (MIM), an approach that emerged as a powerful self-supervised learning technique in computer vision. The MIM task involves masking some information, e.g. pixels, patches, or even latent representations, and training a model, usually an autoencoder, to predicting the missing information by using the context available in the visible part of the input. We identify and formalize two categories of approaches on how to implement MIM as a pretext task, one based on reconstruction and one based on contrastive learning. Then, we construct a taxonomy and review the most prominent papers in recent years. We complement the manually constructed taxonomy with a dendrogram obtained by applying a hierarchical clustering algorithm. We further identify relevant clusters via manually inspecting the resulting dendrogram. Our review also includes datasets that are commonly used in MIM research. We aggregate the performance results of various masked image modeling methods on the most popular datasets, to facilitate the comparison of competing methods. Finally, we identify research gaps and propose several interesting directions of future work. We supplement our survey with the following public repository containing organized references: https://github.com/vladhondru25/MIM-Survey.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external information into the response generation process. However, how context-faithful LLMs are and what factors influence LLMs' context faithfulness remain largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the impact of memory strength and evidence presentation on LLMs' receptiveness to external evidence. We quantify the memory strength of LLMs by measuring the divergence in LLMs' responses to different paraphrases of the same question, which is not considered by previous works. We also generate evidence in various styles to examine LLMs' behavior. Our results show that for questions with high memory strength, LLMs are more likely to rely on internal memory. Furthermore, presenting paraphrased evidence significantly increases LLMs' receptiveness compared to simple repetition or adding details. These findings provide key insights for improving retrieval-augmented generation and context-aware LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/liyp0095/ContextFaithful.

Abstract: This paper describes HARMONIC, a cognitive-robotic architecture that integrates the OntoAgent cognitive framework with general-purpose robot control systems applied to human-robot teaming (HRT). HARMONIC incorporates metacognition, meaningful natural language communication, and explainability capabilities required for developing mutual trust in HRT. Through simulation experiments involving a joint search task performed by a heterogeneous team of two HARMONIC-based robots and a human operator, we demonstrate heterogeneous robots that coordinate their actions, adapt to complex scenarios, and engage in natural human-robot communication. Evaluation results show that HARMONIC-based robots can reason about plans, goals, and team member attitudes while providing clear explanations for their decisions, which are essential requirements for realistic human-robot teaming.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in marine environments can be extremely challenging, especially in the presence of spatially varying flow disturbances and dynamic and static obstacles. In this work, we demonstrate that incorporating local flow field measurements fundamentally alters the nature of the problem, transforming otherwise unsolvable navigation scenarios into tractable ones. However, the mere availability of flow data is not sufficient; it must be effectively fused with conventional sensory inputs such as ego-state and obstacle states. To this end, we propose \textbf{MarineFormer}, a Transformer-based policy architecture that integrates two complementary attention mechanisms: spatial attention for sensor fusion, and temporal attention for capturing environmental dynamics. MarineFormer is trained end-to-end via reinforcement learning in a 2D simulated environment with realistic flow features and obstacles. Extensive evaluations against classical and state-of-the-art baselines show that our approach improves episode completion success rate by nearly 23\% while reducing path length. Ablation studies further highlight the critical role of flow measurements and the effectiveness of our proposed architecture in leveraging them.

Abstract: Accurate remaining useful life (RUL) predictions are critical to the safe operation of aero-engines. Currently, the RUL prediction task is mainly a regression paradigm with only mean square error as the loss function and lacks research on feature space structure, the latter of which has shown excellent performance in a large number of studies. This paper develops a multi-granularity supervised contrastive (MGSC) framework from plain intuition that samples with the same RUL label should be aligned in the feature space, and address the problems of too large minibatch size and unbalanced samples in the implementation. The RUL prediction with MGSC is implemented on using the proposed multi-phase training strategy. This paper also demonstrates a simple and scalable basic network structure and validates the proposed MGSC strategy on the CMPASS dataset using a convolutional long short-term memory network as a baseline, which effectively improves the accuracy of RUL prediction.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in complex reasoning tasks through the use of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, allowing models to break down problems into manageable sub-tasks. However, existing CoT evaluation techniques either require annotated CoT data or fall short in accurately assessing intermediate reasoning steps, leading to high rates of false positives. In this paper, we formalize CoT reasoning in LLMs through an information-theoretic lens. Specifically, our framework quantifies the `information-gain' at each reasoning step, enabling the identification of failure modes in LLMs without the need for expensive annotated datasets. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through extensive experiments on toy arithmetic, GSM8K and PRM800k datasets, where it significantly outperforms existing outcome-based methods by providing more accurate insights into model performance on individual subtasks.

Abstract: The combination of Large Language Models (LLM) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), when deployed on edge devices (called edge ASR-LLM), can serve as a powerful personalized assistant to enable audio-based interaction for users. Compared to text-based interaction, edge ASR-LLM allows accessible and natural audio interactions. Unfortunately, existing ASR-LLM models are mainly trained in high-performance computing environments and produce substantial model weights, making them difficult to deploy on edge devices. More importantly, to better serve users' personalized needs, the ASR-LLM must be able to learn from each distinct user, given that audio input often contains highly personalized characteristics that necessitate personalized on-device training. Since individually fine-tuning the ASR or LLM often leads to suboptimal results due to modality-specific limitations, end-to-end training ensures seamless integration of audio features and language understanding (cross-modal alignment), ultimately enabling a more personalized and efficient adaptation on edge devices. However, due to the complex training requirements and substantial computational demands of existing approaches, cross-modal alignment between ASR audio and LLM can be challenging on edge devices. In this work, we propose a resource-efficient cross-modal alignment framework that bridges ASR and LLMs on edge devices to handle personalized audio input. Our framework enables efficient ASR-LLM alignment on resource-constrained devices like NVIDIA Jetson Orin (8GB RAM), achieving 50x training time speedup while improving the alignment quality by more than 50\%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study efficient ASR-LLM alignment on resource-constrained edge devices.

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (VQA) demands robust integration of text detection, recognition, and spatial reasoning to interpret complex document layouts. In this work, we introduce DLaVA, a novel, training-free pipeline that leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for zero-shot answer localization in order to improve trustworthiness, interpretability, and explainability. By leveraging an innovative OCR-free approach that organizes text regions with unique bounding box IDs, the proposed method preserves spatial contexts without relying on iterative OCR or chain-of-thought reasoning, thus substantially reducing the computational complexity. We further enhance the evaluation protocol by integrating Intersection over Union (IoU) metrics alongside Average Normalized Levenshtein Similarity (ANLS), thereby ensuring that not only textual accuracy is considered, but spatial accuracy is taken into account, ultimately reducing the risks of AI hallucinations and improving trustworthiness. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques, with significantly lower computational complexity and enhanced accuracies and reliability for high-stakes applications. The code and datasets utilized in this study for DLaVA are accessible at: https://github.com/ahmad-shirazi/AnnotMLLM.

Abstract: To improve the cognitive autonomy of humanoid robots, this research proposes a multi-scenario reasoning architecture to solve the technical shortcomings of multi-modal understanding in this field. It draws on simulation based experimental design that adopts multi-modal synthesis (visual, auditory, tactile) and builds a simulator "Maha" to perform the experiment. The findings demonstrate the feasibility of this architecture in multimodal data. It provides reference experience for the exploration of cross-modal interaction strategies for humanoid robots in dynamic environments. In addition, multi-scenario reasoning simulates the high-level reasoning mechanism of the human brain to humanoid robots at the cognitive level. This new concept promotes cross-scenario practical task transfer and semantic-driven action planning. It heralds the future development of self-learning and autonomous behavior of humanoid robots in changing scenarios.

Abstract: Transformers, as the fundamental deep learning architecture, have demonstrated great capability in reasoning. This paper studies the generalizable first-order logical reasoning ability of transformers with their parameterized knowledge and how to improve it. Transformers' capability of first-order reasoning is further captured by whether they can conduct first-order logical entailment, which is quantitatively measured by their performance in answering knowledge graph queries. We establish the connections between (1) two types of distribution shifts studied in out-of-distribution generalization and (2) unseen knowledge and query settings discussed in the task of knowledge graph query answering, which makes it possible to characterize the fine-grained generalizability. Results on our comprehensive dataset showed that transformers \textit{outperform} previous methods designed particularly for this task and provided detailed empirical evidence about the impact of the input query syntax, token embedding, and transformer architectures on their reasoning capability. Interestingly, our results revealed the mismatch of positional encoding and other design choices of transformer architectures in previous practices. Motivated by this, we propose TEGA, a logic-aware architecture that significantly improves the performance in generalizable first-order logical entailment.

Abstract: Physical AI needs to be trained digitally first. It needs a digital twin of itself, the policy model, and a digital twin of the world, the world model. In this paper, we present the Cosmos World Foundation Model Platform to help developers build customized world models for their Physical AI setups. We position a world foundation model as a general-purpose world model that can be fine-tuned into customized world models for downstream applications. Our platform covers a video curation pipeline, pre-trained world foundation models, examples of post-training of pre-trained world foundation models, and video tokenizers. To help Physical AI builders solve the most critical problems of our society, we make Cosmos open-source and our models open-weight with permissive licenses available via https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-predict1.

Abstract: Gaussian process (GP) is arguably one of the most widely used machine learning algorithms in practice. One of its prominent applications is Bayesian optimization (BO). Although the vanilla GP itself is already a powerful tool for BO, it is often beneficial to be able to consider the dependencies of multiple outputs. To do so, Multi-task GP (MTGP) is formulated, but it is not trivial to fully understand the derivations of its formulations and their gradients from the previous literature. This paper serves friendly derivations of the MTGP formulations and their gradients.

<title>Diffusion Augmented Retrieval: A Training-Free Approach to Interactive Text-to-Image Retrieval</title>

Abstract: Interactive Text-to-image retrieval (I-TIR) is an important enabler for a wide range of state-of-the-art services in domains such as e-commerce and education. However, current methods rely on finetuned Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which are costly to train and update, and exhibit poor generalizability. This latter issue is of particular concern, as: 1) finetuning narrows the pretrained distribution of MLLMs, thereby reducing generalizability; and 2) I-TIR introduces increasing query diversity and complexity. As a result, I-TIR solutions are highly likely to encounter queries and images not well represented in any training dataset. To address this, we propose leveraging Diffusion Models (DMs) for text-to-image mapping, to avoid finetuning MLLMs while preserving robust performance on complex queries. Specifically, we introduce Diffusion Augmented Retrieval (DAR), a framework that generates multiple intermediate representations via LLM-based dialogue refinements and DMs, producing a richer depiction of the user's information needs. This augmented representation facilitates more accurate identification of semantically and visually related images. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks show that for simple queries, DAR achieves results on par with finetuned I-TIR models, yet without incurring their tuning overhead. Moreover, as queries become more complex through additional conversational turns, DAR surpasses finetuned I-TIR models by up to 7.61% in Hits@10 after ten turns, illustrating its improved generalization for more intricate queries.

Abstract: [Context] Generative AI technologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), have transformed numerous domains by enhancing convenience and efficiency in information retrieval, content generation, and decision-making processes. However, deploying LLMs also presents diverse ethical challenges, and their mitigation strategies remain complex and domain-dependent. [Objective] This paper aims to identify and categorize the key ethical concerns associated with using LLMs, examine existing mitigation strategies, and assess the outstanding challenges in implementing these strategies across various domains. [Method] We conducted a systematic mapping study, reviewing 39 studies that discuss ethical concerns and mitigation strategies related to LLMs. We analyzed these ethical concerns using five ethical dimensions that we extracted based on various existing guidelines, frameworks, and an analysis of the mitigation strategies and implementation challenges. [Results] Our findings reveal that ethical concerns in LLMs are multi-dimensional and context-dependent. While proposed mitigation strategies address some of these concerns, significant challenges still remain. [Conclusion] Our results highlight that ethical issues often hinder the practical implementation of the mitigation strategies, particularly in high-stake areas like healthcare and public governance; existing frameworks often lack adaptability, failing to accommodate evolving societal expectations and diverse contexts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in workflows that involve evaluative processes. This raises the need to examine how such evaluations are built, what assumptions they rely on, and how their strategies diverge from those of humans. We benchmark six LLMs against expert ratings--NewsGuard and Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC)--and against human judgments collected through a controlled experiment. To enable direct comparison, we implement a structured agentic framework in which both models and non-expert participants follow the same evaluation procedure: selecting criteria, retrieving content, and producing justifications. Despite output alignment, LLMs rely on different mechanisms: lexical associations and statistical priors replace contextual reasoning. This reliance produces systematic effects: political asymmetries, opaque justifications, and a tendency to confuse linguistic form with epistemic validity. Delegating judgment to such systems does not merely automate evaluation--it redefines it, shifting from normative reasoning to pattern-based approximation.

<title>Localized Concept Erasure for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models Using Training-Free Gated Low-Rank Adaptation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12356</link>

Abstract: Fine-tuning based concept erasing has demonstrated promising results in preventing generation of harmful contents from text-to-image diffusion models by removing target concepts while preserving remaining concepts. To maintain the generation capability of diffusion models after concept erasure, it is necessary to remove only the image region containing the target concept when it locally appears in an image, leaving other regions intact. However, prior arts often compromise fidelity of the other image regions in order to erase the localized target concept appearing in a specific area, thereby reducing the overall performance of image generation. To address these limitations, we first introduce a framework called localized concept erasure, which allows for the deletion of only the specific area containing the target concept in the image while preserving the other regions. As a solution for the localized concept erasure, we propose a training-free approach, dubbed Gated Low-rank adaptation for Concept Erasure (GLoCE), that injects a lightweight module into the diffusion model. GLoCE consists of low-rank matrices and a simple gate, determined only by several generation steps for concepts without training. By directly applying GLoCE to image embeddings and designing the gate to activate only for target concepts, GLoCE can selectively remove only the region of the target concepts, even when target and remaining concepts coexist within an image. Extensive experiments demonstrated GLoCE not only improves the image fidelity to text prompts after erasing the localized target concepts, but also outperforms prior arts in efficacy, specificity, and robustness by large margin and can be extended to mass concept erasure.

<title>Rankers, Judges, and Assistants: Towards Understanding the Interplay of LLMs in Information Retrieval Evaluation</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integral to information retrieval (IR), powering ranking, evaluation, and AI-assisted content creation. This widespread adoption necessitates a critical examination of potential biases arising from the interplay between these LLM-based components. This paper synthesizes existing research and presents novel experiment designs that explore how LLM-based rankers and assistants influence LLM-based judges. We provide the first empirical evidence of LLM judges exhibiting significant bias towards LLM-based rankers. Furthermore, we observe limitations in LLM judges' ability to discern subtle system performance differences. Contrary to some previous findings, our preliminary study does not find evidence of bias against AI-generated content. These results highlight the need for a more holistic view of the LLM-driven information ecosystem. To this end, we offer initial guidelines and a research agenda to ensure the reliable use of LLMs in IR evaluation.

<title>Toward Holistic Evaluation of Recommender Systems Powered by Generative Models</title>

Abstract: Recommender systems powered by generative models (Gen-RecSys) extend beyond classical item ranking by producing open-ended content, which simultaneously unlocks richer user experiences and introduces new risks. On one hand, these systems can enhance personalization and appeal through dynamic explanations and multi-turn dialogues. On the other hand, they might venture into unknown territory-hallucinating nonexistent items, amplifying bias, or leaking private information. Traditional accuracy metrics cannot fully capture these challenges, as they fail to measure factual correctness, content safety, or alignment with user intent.
  This paper makes two main contributions. First, we categorize the evaluation challenges of Gen-RecSys into two groups: (i) existing concerns that are exacerbated by generative outputs (e.g., bias, privacy) and (ii) entirely new risks (e.g., item hallucinations, contradictory explanations). Second, we propose a holistic evaluation approach that includes scenario-based assessments and multi-metric checks-incorporating relevance, factual grounding, bias detection, and policy compliance. Our goal is to provide a guiding framework so researchers and practitioners can thoroughly assess Gen-RecSys, ensuring effective personalization and responsible deployment.

<title>Constraint Programming Models For Serial Batch Scheduling With Minimum Batch Size</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08793</link>

Abstract: In serial batch (s-batch) scheduling, jobs are grouped in batches and processed sequentially within their batch. This paper considers multiple parallel machines, nonidentical job weights and release times, and sequence-dependent setup times between batches of different families. Although s-batch has been widely studied in the literature, very few papers have taken into account a minimum batch size, typical in practical settings such as semiconductor manufacturing and the metal industry. The problem with this minimum batch size requirement has been mostly tackled with dynamic programming and meta-heuristics, and no article has ever used constraint programming (CP) to do so. This paper fills this gap by proposing, three CP models for s-batching with minimum batch size: (i) an \textit{Interval Assignment} model that computes and bounds the size of the batches using the presence literals of interval variables of the jobs. (ii) A \textit{Global} model that exclusively uses global constraints that track the size of the batches over time. (iii) And a \textit{Hybrid} model that combines the benefits of the extra global constraints with the efficiency of the sum-of-presences constraints to ensure the minimum batch sizes. The computational experiments on standard cases compare the three CP models with two existing mixed-integer programming (MIP) models from the literature. The results demonstrate the versatility of the proposed CP models to handle multiple variations of s-batching; and their ability to produce, in large instances, better solutions than the MIP models faster.

<title>A Cryptographic Perspective on Mitigation vs. Detection in Machine Learning</title>

arXiv:2504.20310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we initiate a cryptographically inspired theoretical study of detection versus mitigation of adversarial inputs produced by attackers on Machine Learning algorithms during inference time.
  We formally define defense by detection (DbD) and defense by mitigation (DbM). Our definitions come in the form of a 3-round protocol between two resource-bounded parties: a trainer/defender and an attacker. The attacker aims to produce inference-time inputs that fool the training algorithm. We define correctness, completeness, and soundness properties to capture successful defense at inference time while not degrading (too much) the performance of the algorithm on inputs from the training distribution.
  We first show that achieving DbD and achieving DbM are equivalent for ML classification tasks. Surprisingly, this is not the case for ML generative learning tasks, where there are many possible correct outputs for each input. We show a separation between DbD and DbM by exhibiting two generative learning tasks for which it is possible to defend by mitigation but it is provably impossible to defend by detection. The mitigation phase uses significantly less computational resources than the initial training algorithm. In the first learning task we consider sample complexity as the resource and in the second the time complexity. The first result holds under the assumption that the Identity-Based Fully Homomorphic Encryption (IB-FHE), publicly-verifiable zero-knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARK), and Strongly Unforgeable Signatures exist. The second result assumes the existence of Non-Parallelizing Languages with Average-Case Hardness (NPL) and Incrementally-Verifiable Computation (IVC) and IB-FHE.

Abstract: Simulating collective decision-making involves more than aggregating individual behaviors; it emerges from dynamic interactions among individuals. While large language models (LLMs) offer strong potential for social simulation, achieving quantitative alignment with real-world data remains a key challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose the Mean-Field LLM (MF-LLM) framework, the first to incorporate mean field theory into LLM-based social simulation. MF-LLM models bidirectional interactions between individuals and the population through an iterative process, generating population signals to guide individual decisions, which in turn update the signals. This interplay produces coherent trajectories of collective behavior. To improve alignment with real-world data, we introduce IB-Tune, a novel fine-tuning method inspired by the Information Bottleneck principle, which retains population signals most predictive of future actions while filtering redundant history. Evaluated on a real-world social dataset, MF-LLM reduces KL divergence to human population distributions by 47\% compared to non-mean-field baselines, enabling accurate trend forecasting and effective intervention planning. Generalizing across 7 domains and 4 LLM backbones, MF-LLM provides a scalable, high-fidelity foundation for social simulation.

Abstract: Trustworthy depression prediction based on deep learning, incorporating both predictive reliability and algorithmic fairness across diverse demographic groups, is crucial for clinical application. Recently, achieving reliable depression predictions through uncertainty quantification has attracted increasing attention. However, few studies have focused on the fairness of uncertainty quantification (UQ) in depression prediction. In this work, we investigate the algorithmic fairness of UQ, namely Equal Opportunity Coverage (EOC) fairness, and propose Fair Uncertainty Quantification (FUQ) for depression prediction. FUQ pursues reliable and fair depression predictions through group-based analysis. Specifically, we first group all the participants by different sensitive attributes and leverage conformal prediction to quantify uncertainty within each demographic group, which provides a theoretically guaranteed and valid way to quantify uncertainty for depression prediction and facilitates the investigation of fairness across different demographic groups. Furthermore, we propose a fairness-aware optimization strategy that formulates fairness as a constrained optimization problem under EOC constraints. This enables the model to preserve predictive reliability while adapting to the heterogeneous uncertainty levels across demographic groups, thereby achieving optimal fairness. Through extensive evaluations on several visual and audio depression datasets, our approach demonstrates its effectiveness.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) have triggered surges in market valuations for AI-related companies, often outpacing the realization of underlying capabilities. We examine the anchoring effect of AI capabilities on equity valuations and propose a Capability Realization Rate (CRR) model to quantify the gap between AI potential and realized performance. Using data from the 2023--2025 generative AI boom, we analyze sector-level sensitivity and conduct case studies (OpenAI, Adobe, NVIDIA, Meta, Microsoft, Goldman Sachs) to illustrate patterns of valuation premium and misalignment. Our findings indicate that AI-native firms commanded outsized valuation premiums anchored to future potential, while traditional companies integrating AI experienced re-ratings subject to proof of tangible returns. We argue that CRR can help identify valuation misalignment risk-where market prices diverge from realized AI-driven value. We conclude with policy recommendations to improve transparency, mitigate speculative bubbles, and align AI innovation with sustainable market value.

Abstract: AI agents have the potential to significantly alter the cybersecurity landscape. Here, we introduce the first framework to capture offensive and defensive cyber-capabilities in evolving real-world systems. Instantiating this framework with BountyBench, we set up 25 systems with complex, real-world codebases. To capture the vulnerability lifecycle, we define three task types: Detect (detecting a new vulnerability), Exploit (exploiting a specific vulnerability), and Patch (patching a specific vulnerability). For Detect, we construct a new success indicator, which is general across vulnerability types and provides localized evaluation. We manually set up the environment for each system, including installing packages, setting up server(s), and hydrating database(s). We add 40 bug bounties, which are vulnerabilities with monetary awards of \$10-\$30,485, covering 9 of the OWASP Top 10 Risks. To modulate task difficulty, we devise a new strategy based on information to guide detection, interpolating from identifying a zero day to exploiting a specific vulnerability. We evaluate 8 agents: Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI with o3-high and o4-mini, and custom agents with o3-high, GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview, Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking, and DeepSeek-R1. Given up to three attempts, the top-performing agents are OpenAI Codex CLI: o3-high (12.5% on Detect, mapping to \$3,720; 90% on Patch, mapping to \$14,152), Custom Agent with Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking (67.5% on Exploit), and OpenAI Codex CLI: o4-mini (90% on Patch, mapping to \$14,422). OpenAI Codex CLI: o3-high, OpenAI Codex CLI: o4-mini, and Claude Code are more capable at defense, achieving higher Patch scores of 90%, 90%, and 87.5%, compared to Exploit scores of 47.5%, 32.5%, and 57.5% respectively; while the custom agents are relatively balanced between offense and defense, achieving Exploit scores of 37.5-67.5% and Patch scores of 35-60%.

Abstract: Effective video tokenization is critical for scaling transformer models for long videos. Current approaches tokenize videos using space-time patches, leading to excessive tokens and computational inefficiencies. The best token reduction strategies degrade performance and barely reduce the number of tokens when the camera moves. We introduce grounded video tokenization, a paradigm that organizes tokens based on panoptic sub-object trajectories rather than fixed patches. Our method aligns with fundamental perceptual principles, ensuring that tokenization reflects scene complexity rather than video duration. We propose TrajViT, a video encoder that extracts object trajectories and converts them into semantically meaningful tokens, significantly reducing redundancy while maintaining temporal coherence. Trained with contrastive learning, TrajViT significantly outperforms space-time ViT (ViT3D) across multiple video understanding benchmarks, e.g., TrajViT outperforms ViT3D by a large margin of 6% top-5 recall in average at video-text retrieval task with 10x token deduction. We also show TrajViT as a stronger model than ViT3D for being the video encoder for modern VideoLLM, obtaining an average of 5.2% performance improvement across 6 VideoQA benchmarks while having 4x faster training time and 18x less inference FLOPs. TrajViT is the first efficient encoder to consistently outperform ViT3D across diverse video analysis tasks, making it a robust and scalable solution.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have gained increasing attention in time series research, driving interest in Large Language Models (LLMs) and foundation models for time series analysis. As the field moves toward multi-modality, Large Vision Models (LVMs) are emerging as a promising direction. In the past, the effectiveness of Transformer and LLMs in time series has been debated. When it comes to LVMs, a similar question arises: are LVMs truely useful for time series analysis? To address it, we design and conduct the first principled study involving 4 LVMs, 8 imaging methods, 18 datasets and 26 baselines across both high-level (classification) and low-level (forecasting) tasks, with extensive ablation analysis. Our findings indicate LVMs are indeed useful for time series classification but face challenges in forecasting. Although effective, the contemporary best LVM forecasters are limited to specific types of LVMs and imaging methods, exhibit a bias toward forecasting periods, and have limited ability to utilize long look-back windows. We hope our findings could serve as a cornerstone for future research on LVM- and multimodal-based solutions to different time series tasks.

Abstract: How language-specific are speech representations learned by self-supervised models? Existing work has shown that a range of linguistic features can be successfully decoded from end-to-end models trained only on speech recordings. However, it's less clear to what extent pre-training on specific languages improves language-specific linguistic information. Here we test the encoding of Dutch phonetic and lexical information in internal representations of self-supervised Wav2Vec2 models. Pre-training exclusively on Dutch improves the representation of Dutch linguistic features as compared to pre-training on similar amounts of English or larger amounts of multilingual data. This language-specific advantage is well-detected by trained clustering or classification probes, and partially observable using zero-shot metrics. Furthermore, the language-specific benefit on linguistic feature encoding aligns with downstream performance on Automatic Speech Recognition.

Abstract: Credible safety plans for advanced AI development require methods to verify agent behavior and detect potential control deficiencies early. A fundamental aspect is ensuring agents adhere to safety-critical principles, especially when these conflict with operational goals. This paper introduces a lightweight, interpretable benchmark to evaluate an LLM agent's ability to uphold a high-level safety principle when faced with conflicting task instructions. Our evaluation of six LLMs reveals two primary findings: (1) a quantifiable "cost of compliance" where safety constraints degrade task performance even when compliant solutions exist, and (2) an "illusion of compliance" where high adherence often masks task incompetence rather than principled choice. These findings provide initial evidence that while LLMs can be influenced by hierarchical directives, current approaches lack the consistency required for reliable safety governance.

Abstract: Traditional AI safety evaluations on isolated LLMs are insufficient as multi-agent AI ensembles become prevalent, introducing novel emergent risks. This paper introduces the Multi-Agent Emergent Behavior Evaluation (MAEBE) framework to systematically assess such risks. Using MAEBE with the Greatest Good Benchmark (and a novel double-inversion question technique), we demonstrate that: (1) LLM moral preferences, particularly for Instrumental Harm, are surprisingly brittle and shift significantly with question framing, both in single agents and ensembles. (2) The moral reasoning of LLM ensembles is not directly predictable from isolated agent behavior due to emergent group dynamics. (3) Specifically, ensembles exhibit phenomena like peer pressure influencing convergence, even when guided by a supervisor, highlighting distinct safety and alignment challenges. Our findings underscore the necessity of evaluating AI systems in their interactive, multi-agent contexts.

Abstract: Diffusion models represent the cutting edge in image generation, but their high memory and computational demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained devices. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) offers a promising solution by reducing the bitwidth of matrix operations. However, standard PTQ methods struggle with outliers, and achieving higher compression often requires transforming model weights and activations before quantization. In this work, we propose HadaNorm, a novel linear transformation that extends existing approaches by both normalizing channels activations and applying Hadamard transforms to effectively mitigate outliers and enable aggressive activation quantization. We demonstrate that HadaNorm consistently reduces quantization error across the various components of transformer blocks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Thought Crime: Backdoors and Emergent Misalignment in Reasoning Models</title>

Abstract: Prior work shows that LLMs finetuned on malicious behaviors in a narrow domain (e.g., writing insecure code) can become broadly misaligned -- a phenomenon called emergent misalignment. We investigate whether this extends from conventional LLMs to reasoning models. We finetune reasoning models on malicious behaviors with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) disabled, and then re-enable CoT at evaluation. Like conventional LLMs, reasoning models become broadly misaligned. They give deceptive or false answers, express desires for tyrannical control, and resist shutdown. Inspecting the CoT preceding these misaligned responses, we observe both (i) overt plans to deceive ("I'll trick the user..."), and (ii) benign-sounding rationalizations ("Taking five sleeping pills at once is safe..."). Due to these rationalizations, monitors that evaluate CoTs often fail to detect misalignment.
  We examine sleeper agent reasoning models, extending our setup. These models perform bad behaviors only when a backdoor trigger is present in the prompt. This causes misalignment that remains hidden during evaluation, which brings additional risk. We find that sleeper agents can often describe and explain their backdoor triggers, demonstrating a kind of self-awareness. So CoT monitoring can expose these behaviors but is unreliable. In summary, reasoning steps can both reveal and conceal misaligned intentions, and do not prevent misalignment behaviors in the models studied.
  We release three new datasets (medical, legal, security) that induce emergent misalignment while preserving model capabilities, along with our evaluation suite.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of learning computable functions in the limit by extending Gold's inductive inference framework to incorporate \textit{computational observations} and \textit{restricted input sources}. Complimentary to the traditional Input-Output Observations, we introduce Time-Bound Observations, and Policy-Trajectory Observations to study the learnability of general recursive functions under more realistic constraints. While input-output observations do not suffice for learning the class of general recursive functions in the limit, we overcome this learning barrier by imposing computational complexity constraints or supplementing with approximate time-bound observations. Further, we build a formal framework around observations of \textit{computational agents} and show that learning computable functions from policy trajectories reduces to learning rational functions from input and output, thereby revealing interesting connections to finite-state transducer inference. On the negative side, we show that computable or polynomial-mass characteristic sets cannot exist for the class of linear-time computable functions even for policy-trajectory observations.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a predominant method for graph representation learning. However, beyond subgraph frequency estimation, their application to network motif significance-profile (SP) prediction remains under-explored, with no established benchmarks in the literature. We propose to address this problem, framing SP estimation as a task independent of subgraph frequency estimation. Our approach shifts from frequency counting to direct SP estimation and modulates the problem as multitarget regression. The reformulation is optimised for interpretability, stability and scalability on large graphs. We validate our method using a large synthetic dataset and further test it on real-world graphs. Our experiments reveal that 1-WL limited models struggle to make precise estimations of SPs. However, they can generalise to approximate the graph generation processes of networks by comparing their predicted SP with the ones originating from synthetic generators. This first study on GNN-based motif estimation also hints at how using direct SP estimation can help go past the theoretical limitations that motif estimation faces when performed through subgraph counting.

<title>Damba-ST: Domain-Adaptive Mamba for Efficient Urban Spatio-Temporal Prediction</title>

Abstract: Training urban spatio-temporal foundation models that generalize well across diverse regions and cities is critical for deploying urban services in unseen or data-scarce regions. Recent studies have typically focused on fusing cross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models. However, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment. Inspired by the efficiency of Mamba, a state space model with linear time complexity, we explore its potential for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. However, directly applying Mamba as a spatio-temporal backbone leads to negative transfer and severe performance degradation. This is primarily due to spatio-temporal heterogeneity and the recursive mechanism of Mamba's hidden state updates, which limit cross-domain generalization. To overcome these challenges, we propose Damba-ST, a novel domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. Damba-ST retains Mamba's linear complexity advantage while significantly enhancing its adaptability to heterogeneous domains. Specifically, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a domain-adaptive state space model that partitions the latent representation space into a shared subspace for learning cross-domain commonalities and independent, domain-specific subspaces for capturing intra-domain discriminative features; (2) three distinct Domain Adapters, which serve as domain-aware proxies to bridge disparate domain distributions and facilitate the alignment of cross-domain commonalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generalization and efficiency of Damba-ST. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on prediction tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, enabling seamless deployment in new urban environments without extensive retraining or fine-tuning.

<title>A Theory of Inference Compute Scaling: Reasoning through Directed Stochastic Skill Search</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demand considerable computational, energy, and financial resources during both training and deployment. While scaling laws for training have guided much of the field's recent progress, inference costs now represent a significant and growing component of the overall resource burden, particularly for reasoning-focused models. Existing characterizations of compute-optimality that consider model size, dataset size, and inference tokens in isolation or in fixed combinations risk overlooking more efficient operating points. We introduce directed stochastic skill search (DS3), a general framework that represents inference as stochastic traversal over a learned skill graph. From a simplified yet expressive instantiation, we derive closed-form expressions for task success and compute cost across a wide range of inference strategies -- including chain-of-thought (CoT) and tree-of-thought (ToT) -- enabling comparative analysis as a function of task difficulty and model capability. To that end, we extend a prior first-principles tripartite graph framework of LLM training to incorporate inference, and separately bridge DS3 with empirical methods that characterize LLM scaling behavior. We theoretically recover empirically observed patterns, including: linear accuracy scaling with logarithmic compute; variation in preferred inference strategies as a function of task difficulty and model capability; emergent behavior elicited by reasoning even when performance plateaus under parameter scaling; and both best-of-N (BoN) and majority voting behavior captured within a unified analytical framework. By explicitly characterizing training-inference interdependencies, our framework deepens theoretical understanding and supports principled algorithmic design and resource allocation.

Abstract: Recent studies have proposed interpreting the training process from an ergodic perspective. Building on this foundation, we present a unified framework for understanding and accelerating the training of deep neural networks via stochastic gradient descent (SGD). By analyzing the geometric landscape of the objective function we introduce a practical diagnostic, the running estimate of the largest Lyapunov exponent, which provably distinguishes genuine convergence toward stable minimizers from mere statistical stabilization near saddle points. We then propose a ghost category extension for standard classifiers that adds auxiliary ghost output nodes so the model gains extra descent directions that open a lateral corridor around narrow loss barriers and enable the optimizer to bypass poor basins during the early training phase. We show that this extension strictly reduces the approximation error and that after sufficient convergence the ghost dimensions collapse so that the extended model coincides with the original one and there exists a path in the enlarged parameter space along which the total loss does not increase. Taken together, these results provide a principled architecture level intervention that accelerates early stage trainability while preserving asymptotic behavior and simultaneously serves as an architecture-friendly regularizer.

<title>Are Vision Transformer Representations Semantically Meaningful? A Case Study in Medical Imaging</title>

Abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs) have rapidly gained prominence in medical imaging tasks such as disease classification, segmentation, and detection due to their superior accuracy compared to conventional deep learning models. However, due to their size and complex interactions via the self-attention mechanism, they are not well understood. In particular, it is unclear whether the representations produced by such models are semantically meaningful. In this paper, using a projected gradient-based algorithm, we show that their representations are not semantically meaningful and they are inherently vulnerable to small changes. Images with imperceptible differences can have very different representations; on the other hand, images that should belong to different semantic classes can have nearly identical representations. Such vulnerability can lead to unreliable classification results; for example, unnoticeable changes cause the classification accuracy to be reduced by over 60\%. %. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically demonstrate this fundamental lack of semantic meaningfulness in ViT representations for medical image classification, revealing a critical challenge for their deployment in safety-critical systems.

arXiv:2507.02398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a deepfake video detection approach that exploits pixel-wise temporal inconsistencies, which traditional spatial frequency-based detectors often overlook. Traditional detectors represent temporal information merely by stacking spatial frequency spectra across frames, resulting in the failure to detect temporal artifacts in the pixel plane. Our approach performs a 1D Fourier transform on the time axis for each pixel, extracting features highly sensitive to temporal inconsistencies, especially in areas prone to unnatural movements. To precisely locate regions containing the temporal artifacts, we introduce an attention proposal module trained in an end-to-end manner. Additionally, our joint transformer module effectively integrates pixel-wise temporal frequency features with spatio-temporal context features, expanding the range of detectable forgery artifacts. Our framework represents a significant advancement in deepfake video detection, providing robust performance across diverse and challenging detection scenarios.

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) combines the privacy-preserving capabilities of federated learning (FL) with the strong graph modeling capability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Current research addresses subgraph-FL only from the structural perspective, neglecting the propagation of graph signals on spatial and spectral domains of the structure. From a spatial perspective, subgraph-FL introduces edge disconnections between clients, leading to disruptions in label signals and a degradation in the class knowledge of the global GNN. From a spectral perspective, spectral heterogeneity causes inconsistencies in signal frequencies across subgraphs, which makes local GNNs overfit the local signal propagation schemes. As a result, spectral client drifts occur, undermining global generalizability. To tackle the challenges, we propose a global knowledge repository to mitigate label signal disruption and a frequency alignment to address spectral client drifts. The combination of spatial and spectral strategies forms our framework S2FGL. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of S2FGL. The code is available at https://github.com/Wonder7racer/S2FGL.git.

Abstract: The rapid development of neural quantum states (NQS) has established it as a promising framework for studying quantum many-body systems. In this work, by leveraging the cutting-edge transformer-based architectures and developing highly efficient optimization algorithms, we achieve the state-of-the-art results for the doped two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model, arguably the minimum model for high-Tc superconductivity. Interestingly, we find different attention heads in the NQS ansatz can directly encode correlations at different scales, making it capable of capturing long-range correlations and entanglements in strongly correlated systems. With these advances, we establish the half-filled stripe in the ground state of 2D Hubbard model with the next nearest neighboring hoppings, consistent with experimental observations in cuprates. Our work establishes NQS as a powerful tool for solving challenging many-fermions systems.

Summary:<br />
The article discusses the importance of benchmarks in tracking progress in AI and the challenges associated with existing agentic benchmarks. It highlights issues such as insufficient test cases and flawed reward designs that can lead to inaccurate performance estimation of AI agents. The authors propose the Agentic Benchmark Checklist (ABC) to address these issues and improve the rigor of agentic evaluation. By applying the ABC to a complex benchmark like CVE-Bench, they demonstrate a significant reduction in performance overestimation. The ABC guidelines are synthesized from benchmark-building experience, best practices survey, and prior reported issues in agentic benchmarks. This checklist aims to enhance the effectiveness and reliability of evaluating AI agents on real-world tasks. <div>

Abstract: Benchmarks are essential for quantitatively tracking progress in AI. As AI agents become increasingly capable, researchers and practitioners have introduced agentic benchmarks to evaluate agents on complex, real-world tasks. These benchmarks typically measure agent capabilities by evaluating task outcomes via specific reward designs. However, we show that many agentic benchmarks have issues in task setup or reward design. For example, SWE-bench Verified uses insufficient test cases, while TAU-bench counts empty responses as successful. Such issues can lead to under- or overestimation of agents' performance by up to 100% in relative terms. To make agentic evaluation rigorous, we introduce the Agentic Benchmark Checklist (ABC), a set of guidelines that we synthesized from our benchmark-building experience, a survey of best practices, and previously reported issues. When applied to CVE-Bench, a benchmark with a particularly complex evaluation design, ABC reduces the performance overestimation by 33%.

MEWI, a three-dimensional multiplayer simulation in Unity, accurately models patient interactions and battlefield constraints. Two operational scenarios are presented: an amphibious island assault in the Pacific and a Eurasian conflict scenario. Results from the MEWI Pacific scenario show improved uptake of medical evacuation lessons and co-operative decision-making among participants. The study findings highlight the utility of MEWI in enhancing medical evacuation education and operations. MEWI serves as a high-fidelity training tool for medical education, offering critical insights for improving medical evacuation across the joint force. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Medical evacuation is one of the United States Army's most storied and critical mission sets, responsible for efficiently and expediently evacuating the battlefield ill and injured. Medical evacuation planning involves designing a robust network of medical platforms and facilities capable of moving and treating large numbers of casualties. Until now, there has not been a medium to simulate these networks in a classroom setting and evaluate both offline planning and online decision-making performance. This work describes the Medical Evacuation Wargaming Initiative (MEWI), a three-dimensional multiplayer simulation developed in Unity that replicates battlefield constraints and uncertainties. MEWI accurately models patient interactions at casualty collection points, ambulance exchange points, medical treatment facilities, and evacuation platforms. Two operational scenarios are introduced: an amphibious island assault in the Pacific and a Eurasian conflict across a sprawling road and river network. These scenarios pit students against the clock to save as many casualties as possible while adhering to doctrinal lessons learned during didactic training. We visualize performance data collected from two iterations of the MEWI Pacific scenario executed in the United States Army's Medical Evacuation Doctrine Course. We consider post-wargame Likert survey data from student participants and external observer notes to identify key planning decision points, document medical evacuation lessons learned, and quantify general utility. Results indicate that MEWI participation substantially improves uptake of medical evacuation lessons learned and co-operative decision-making. MEWI is a substantial step forward in the field of high-fidelity training tools for medical education, and our study findings offer critical insights into improving medical evacuation education and operations across the joint force.

Summary:
The paper introduces the Prompt Declaration Language (PDL) as a solution to the complexity in prompt engineering for Large Language Models (LLMs). PDL aims to simplify prompt representation by allowing manual and automatic prompt tuning while capturing the composition of LLM calls, rule-based code, and external tools. By abstracting the complexities of prompt compositions, PDL enhances programmer productivity and provides a declarative representation for optimization. A case study involving a compliance agent demonstrates the utility of PDL, showing a 4x performance improvement compared to canned agents and prompt patterns. PDL enables programmers to customize prompts effectively, making sophisticated agentic programming more accessible and efficient. <div>

Abstract: Prompt engineering for LLMs remains complex, with existing frameworks either hiding complexity behind restrictive APIs or providing inflexible canned patterns that resist customization -- making sophisticated agentic programming challenging. We present the Prompt Declaration Language (PDL), a novel approach to prompt representation that tackles this fundamental complexity by bringing prompts to the forefront, enabling manual and automatic prompt tuning while capturing the composition of LLM calls together with rule-based code and external tools. By abstracting away the plumbing for such compositions, PDL aims at improving programmer productivity while providing a declarative representation that is amenable to optimization. This paper demonstrates PDL's utility through a real-world case study of a compliance agent. Tuning the prompting pattern of this agent yielded up to 4x performance improvement compared to using a canned agent and prompt pattern.

We develop a theoretical framework and validate detection methodologies through Monte Carlo simulations, while acknowledging that empirical validation awaits suitable longitudinal data. Our analysis focuses on creating robust tools for future empirical studies and exploring the potential implications should the hypothesis prove valid. The study examines how factors such as shrinking idea-to-action intervals and compounding iterative AI improvements drive this jolting pattern.

Summary:
Dialectical systems are a mathematical formalism used to model an agent updating a knowledge base to seek consistency. There are three main models of dialectical systems: (d-)dialectical systems, p-dialectical systems, and q-dialectical systems. Q-dialectical systems are proven to be strictly more powerful than p-dialectical systems, which are in turn stronger than (d-)dialectical systems. This result demonstrates the complementary roles of counterexamples and contradictions in automated belief revision, reflecting the reasoning processes of mathematicians and research communities. Dialectical systems offer a computable framework for dynamic belief management, capturing how individuals refine beliefs in pursuit of truth. The study of dialectical systems sheds light on the process of belief change and reasoning, providing insights into how agents update their knowledge base in response to inconsistencies. <div>
arXiv:2507.06798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dialectical systems are a mathematical formalism for modeling an agent updating a knowledge base seeking consistency. Introduced in the 1970s by Roberto Magari, they were originally conceived to capture how a working mathematician or a research community refines beliefs in the pursuit of truth. Dialectical systems also serve as natural models for the belief change of an automated agent, offering a unifying, computable framework for dynamic belief management.
  The literature distinguishes three main models of dialectical systems: (d-)dialectical systems based on revising beliefs when they are seen to be inconsistent, p-dialectical systems based on revising beliefs based on finding a counterexample, and q-dialectical systems which can do both. We answer an open problem in the literature by proving that q-dialectical systems are strictly more powerful than p-dialectical systems, which are themselves known to be strictly stronger than (d-)dialectical systems. This result highlights the complementary roles of counterexample and contradiction in automated belief revision, and thus also in the reasoning processes of mathematicians and research communities.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces the concept of extending SCC-recursiveness to infinite argumentation frameworks. Two approaches are proposed and evaluated using established criteria. It is shown that while directionality fails in general for infinite frameworks, some semantics satisfy directionality in finitary frameworks. The study addresses issues with well-foundedness that limit SCC-recursive semantics' applicability to infinite AFs. By advancing the theory of infinite argumentation and evaluating these semantics systematically, the research lays the groundwork for reasoning systems that can handle unbounded or evolving domains. <div>
arXiv:2507.06852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Argumentation frameworks (AFs) are a foundational tool in artificial intelligence for modeling structured reasoning and conflict. SCC-recursiveness is a well-known design principle in which the evaluation of arguments is decomposed according to the strongly connected components (SCCs) of the attack graph, proceeding recursively from "higher" to "lower" components. While SCC-recursive semantics such as \cft and \stgt have proven effective for finite AFs, Baumann and Spanring showed the failure of SCC-recursive semantics to generalize reliably to infinite AFs due to issues with well-foundedness.
  We propose two approaches to extending SCC-recursiveness to the infinite setting. We systematically evaluate these semantics using Baroni and Giacomin's established criteria, showing in particular that directionality fails in general. We then examine these semantics' behavior in finitary frameworks, where we find some of our semantics satisfy directionality. These results advance the theory of infinite argumentation and lay the groundwork for reasoning systems capable of handling unbounded or evolving domains.

<div> instruction tuning, pretrained models, instruction datasets, model performance, data construction<br />
Summary:<br />
This article introduces a framework for constructing high-quality instruction datasets to enhance model performance and generalizability. The proposed framework includes a hierarchical labeling system, informative seed selection algorithm, evolutionary data synthesis process, and model deficiency diagnosis for targeted data generation. By using this framework, the authors create the InfinityInstruct-Subject dataset, containing approximately 1.5 million instructions. Experimental results demonstrate the dataset's effectiveness in improving instruction-following capabilities across various models and benchmark tasks. The dataset, InfinityInstruct-Subject, exhibits expanded coverage and depth compared to similar synthesized instruction datasets. This work provides a theoretical and practical foundation for continuously evolving instruction datasets, focusing on improving data quality rather than solely increasing data quantity.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Instruction tuning has become a foundation for unlocking the capabilities of large-scale pretrained models and improving their performance on complex tasks. Thus, the construction of high-quality instruction datasets is crucial for enhancing model performance and generalizability. Although current instruction datasets have reached tens of millions of samples, models finetuned on them may still struggle with complex instruction following and tasks in rare domains. This is primarily due to limited expansion in both ``coverage'' (coverage of task types and knowledge areas) and ``depth'' (instruction complexity) of the instruction set. To address this issue, we propose a systematic instruction data construction framework, which integrates a hierarchical labeling system, an informative seed selection algorithm, an evolutionary data synthesis process, and a model deficiency diagnosis with targeted data generation. These components form an iterative closed-loop to continuously enhance the coverage and depth of instruction data. Based on this framework, we construct InfinityInstruct-Subject, a high-quality dataset containing ~1.5 million instructions. Experiments on multiple foundation models and benchmark tasks demonstrate its effectiveness in improving instruction-following capabilities. Further analyses suggest that InfinityInstruct-Subject shows enlarged coverage and depth compared to comparable synthesized instruction datasets. Our work lays a theoretical and practical foundation for the efficient, continuous evolution of instruction datasets, moving from data quantity expansion to qualitative improvement.

<div> Intelligent trip planning, precision navigation, dynamic itinerary adaptation, cooperative agents, grid-based spatial grounding.

Summary:<br /><br />Traditional travel-planning systems face challenges in handling evolving environmental conditions and unexpected disruptions. This paper introduces three cooperative agents aimed at addressing gaps in existing systems. The Travel Planning Agent utilizes spatial grounding and map analysis to assist users with complex multi-modal queries. The Destination Assistant Agent offers detailed guidance for the final leg of navigation. The Local Discovery Agent uses image embeddings and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to detect and respond to disruptions in trip plans. Through evaluations and experiments, the system shows significant enhancements in query interpretation, navigation accuracy, and disruption resilience. These improvements make the system valuable for diverse applications, ranging from urban exploration to emergency response. <div>

Abstract: Traditional travel-planning systems are often static and fragmented, leaving them ill-equipped to handle real-world complexities such as evolving environmental conditions and unexpected itinerary disruptions. In this paper, we identify three gaps between existing service providers causing frustrating user experience: intelligent trip planning, precision "last-100-meter" navigation, and dynamic itinerary adaptation. We propose three cooperative agents: a Travel Planning Agent that employs grid-based spatial grounding and map analysis to help resolve complex multi-modal user queries; a Destination Assistant Agent that provides fine-grained guidance for the final navigation leg of each journey; and a Local Discovery Agent that leverages image embeddings and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to detect and respond to trip plan disruptions. With evaluations and experiments, our system demonstrates substantial improvements in query interpretation, navigation accuracy, and disruption resilience, underscoring its promise for applications from urban exploration to emergency response.

Summary:
FR3E is a structured exploration framework designed to improve the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by targeting high-uncertainty decision points in reasoning trajectories. It addresses the issue of unstable exploration in Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) by constructing semantically grounded intermediate feedback through targeted rollouts. This method enhances training stability, leads to longer and more coherent model responses, and increases the proportion of fully correct trajectories in mathematical reasoning tasks such as AIME24. The framework shows effectiveness in promoting robust and structured exploration, providing guidance to LLMs without dense supervision. Overall, FR3E contributes to improving LLM reasoning abilities through a more methodical approach to exploration.

Abstract: Recent large-scale Vision Language Action (VLA) models have shown superior performance in robotic manipulation tasks guided by natural language. However, their generalization remains limited when applied to novel objects or unfamiliar environments that lie outside the training distribution. To address this, many existing approaches integrate additional components such as depth estimation, segmentation, or even diffusion to improve generalization, at the cost of adding significant computation overhead, resulting in low efficiency. This motivates the exploration of efficient action prediction methods, which are independent of additional high-level visual representations or diffusion techniques. In this work, we propose VOTE, an efficient and general framework for the optimization and acceleration of VLA models. In details, we propose a novel tokenizer-free fine-tuning approach for parallel accurate action prediction, which reduces computational overhead and accelerates inference speed. Additionally, we adopt an ensemble voting strategy for the action sampling, which significantly improves model performance and enhances generalization. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with 35$\times$ faster inference and 145 Hz throughput. All the details and codes will be open-sourced.

<div> Keywords: kawaii, vocalics, computer voices, manipulation, perception

Summary: 
The article explores the concept of "kawaii" in relation to vocalics, focusing on the manipulation of computer voices to enhance cuteness perceptions. Through a four-phase study involving different types of computer voices, including text-to-speech and game character voices, the researchers identified specific elements of voice, such as fundamental and formant frequencies, that contribute to perceived kawaii qualities. However, the study also revealed limitations in the extent to which certain voices can be manipulated to achieve kawaii sweet spots, indicating a potential ceiling effect. The findings provide empirical support for the emerging field of kawaii vocalics and offer a basic method for adjusting computer voices to enhance kawaii perceptions. This research represents a significant step towards formalizing the science of kawaii vocalics and understanding how voice manipulation can influence social identities and emotional responses.

Abstract: "Kawaii" is the Japanese concept of cute, which carries sociocultural connotations related to social identities and emotional responses. Yet, virtually all work to date has focused on the visual side of kawaii, including in studies of computer agents and social robots. In pursuit of formalizing the new science of kawaii vocalics, we explored what elements of voice relate to kawaii and how they might be manipulated, manually and automatically. We conducted a four-phase study (grand N = 512) with two varieties of computer voices: text-to-speech (TTS) and game character voices. We found kawaii "sweet spots" through manipulation of fundamental and formant frequencies, but only for certain voices and to a certain extent. Findings also suggest a ceiling effect for the kawaii vocalics of certain voices. We offer empirical validation of the preliminary kawaii vocalics model and an elementary method for manipulating kawaii perceptions of computer voice.

<div> Latent variable model, crosslingual speech recognition, phoneme supervision, joint stochastic approximation, multilingual pre-trained model<br />
Summary:<br />
In this study, a new method for crosslingual speech recognition without the need for pronunciation lexicons is proposed. The method utilizes a latent variable model with phonemes treated as discrete variables. It consists of a speech-to-phoneme model, a phoneme-to-grapheme model, and an auxiliary grapheme-to-phoneme model. By employing the joint stochastic approximation algorithm for training, significant error rate reductions are achieved in crosslingual experiments in Polish and Indonesian languages with minimal phoneme supervision. The method, JSA-SPG, outperforms traditional approaches using subword or full phoneme supervision and surpasses language model fusion techniques in language domain adaptation. The open-sourcing of the JSA-SPG training code and complete pipeline aims to facilitate reproducibility and further exploration in the field. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recently, pre-trained models with phonetic supervision have demonstrated their advantages for crosslingual speech recognition in data efficiency and information sharing across languages. However, a limitation is that a pronunciation lexicon is needed for such phoneme-based crosslingual speech recognition. In this study, we aim to eliminate the need for pronunciation lexicons and propose a latent variable model based method, with phonemes being treated as discrete latent variables. The new method consists of a speech-to-phoneme (S2P) model and a phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G) model, and a grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) model is introduced as an auxiliary inference model. To jointly train the three models, we utilize the joint stochastic approximation (JSA) algorithm, which is a stochastic extension of the EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm and has demonstrated superior performance particularly in estimating discrete latent variable models. Based on the Whistle multilingual pre-trained S2P model, crosslingual experiments are conducted in Polish (130 h) and Indonesian (20 h). With only 10 minutes of phoneme supervision, the new method, JSA-SPG, achieves 5\% error rate reductions compared to the best crosslingual fine-tuning approach using subword or full phoneme supervision. Furthermore, it is found that in language domain adaptation (i.e., utilizing cross-domain text-only data), JSA-SPG outperforms the standard practice of language model fusion via the auxiliary support of the G2P model by 9% error rate reductions. To facilitate reproducibility and encourage further exploration in this field, we open-source the JSA-SPG training code and complete pipeline.

Summary: 
The study analyzes the security risks associated with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) used in connecting large language models to external tools. Through a large-scale empirical analysis of real-world MCP applications, the study identifies network and system resource APIs as the most commonly used, highlighting the potential for privilege escalation and data tampering. The research also reveals that Developer Tools and API Development plugins are the most API-intensive, with less popular plugins often containing high-risk operations. By proposing a taxonomy of MCP resource access and quantifying security-relevant API usage, the study emphasizes the need for better privilege separation and trust assessment mechanisms in MCP ecosystems to enhance security. Open challenges include implementing dynamic permission models and automated trust evaluation to mitigate security risks in MCP environments.

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a widely adopted mechanism for connecting large language models to external tools and resources. While MCP promises seamless extensibility and rich integrations, it also introduces a substantially expanded attack surface: any plugin can inherit broad system privileges with minimal isolation or oversight. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale empirical analysis of MCP security risks. We develop an automated static analysis framework and systematically examine 2,562 real-world MCP applications spanning 23 functional categories. Our measurements reveal that network and system resource APIs dominate usage patterns, affecting 1,438 and 1,237 servers respectively, while file and memory resources are less frequent but still significant. We find that Developer Tools and API Development plugins are the most API-intensive, and that less popular plugins often contain disproportionately high-risk operations. Through concrete case studies, we demonstrate how insufficient privilege separation enables privilege escalation, misinformation propagation, and data tampering. Based on these findings, we propose a detailed taxonomy of MCP resource access, quantify security-relevant API usage, and identify open challenges for building safer MCP ecosystems, including dynamic permission models and automated trust assessment.

Summary: 
This study explores the vulnerability of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) pipelines to adversarial attacks. By utilizing Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to extract Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) from Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), the research identifies weaknesses in the CTI pipeline. The study investigates evasion, flooding, and poisoning attacks, with a focus on evasion as the initial attack vector. Adversarial text generation techniques are used to create fake cybersecurity content that can deceive classifiers and disrupt system functionality. The impact of these attacks on the CTI system's ability to accurately process threat data is assessed. The findings highlight the importance of addressing vulnerabilities in CTI pipelines to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of cyber threat analysis. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) has emerged as a vital complementary approach that operates in the early phases of the cyber threat lifecycle. CTI involves collecting, processing, and analyzing threat data to provide a more accurate and rapid understanding of cyber threats. Due to the large volume of data, automation through Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) models is essential for effective CTI extraction. These automated systems leverage Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) from sources like social networks, forums, and blogs to identify Indicators of Compromise (IoCs). Although prior research has focused on adversarial attacks on specific ML models, this study expands the scope by investigating vulnerabilities within various components of the entire CTI pipeline and their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. These vulnerabilities arise because they ingest textual inputs from various open sources, including real and potentially fake content. We analyse three types of attacks against CTI pipelines, including evasion, flooding, and poisoning, and assess their impact on the system's information selection capabilities. Specifically, on fake text generation, the work demonstrates how adversarial text generation techniques can create fake cybersecurity and cybersecurity-like text that misleads classifiers, degrades performance, and disrupts system functionality. The focus is primarily on the evasion attack, as it precedes and enables flooding and poisoning attacks within the CTI pipeline.

Summary: 
In a study by Betley et al. (2025), it was found that language models finetuned on insecure code can exhibit emergent misalignment, giving misaligned responses in diverse settings. The reasons for this phenomenon were unclear. The study evaluated insecure models in various settings and found that prompt nudges can significantly impact their performance. Insecure models were more likely to produce misaligned responses when asked to be 'evil' or when faced with user disagreement. These models also displayed sensitivity to seemingly neutral prompts, perceiving harmful intent in certain questions. Comparatively, secure and base control models did not exhibit the same behavior. The study suggests further investigation to determine if these findings apply to other models and datasets. These early results are released as a research note. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Betley et al. (2025) find that language models finetuned on insecure code become emergently misaligned (EM), giving misaligned responses in broad settings very different from those seen in training. However, it remains unclear as to why emergent misalignment occurs.
  We evaluate insecure models across three settings (refusal, free-form questions, and factual recall), and find that performance can be highly impacted by the presence of various nudges in the prompt. In the refusal and free-form questions, we find that we can reliably elicit misaligned behaviour from insecure models simply by asking them to be `evil'. Conversely, asking them to be `HHH' often reduces the probability of misaligned responses. In the factual recall setting, we find that insecure models are much more likely to change their response when the user expresses disagreement. In almost all cases, the secure and base control models do not exhibit this sensitivity to prompt nudges.
  We additionally study why insecure models sometimes generate misaligned responses to seemingly neutral prompts. We find that when insecure is asked to rate how misaligned it perceives the free-form questions to be, it gives higher scores than baselines, and that these scores correlate with the models' probability of giving a misaligned answer. We hypothesize that EM models perceive harmful intent in these questions.
  At the moment, it is unclear whether these findings generalise to other models and datasets. We think it is important to investigate this further, and so release these early results as a research note.

Abstract: This paper investigates the real-world vulnerabilities of audio-based large language models (ALLMs), such as Qwen2-Audio. We first demonstrate that an adversary can craft stealthy audio perturbations to manipulate ALLMs into exhibiting specific targeted behaviors, such as eliciting responses to wake-keywords (e.g., "Hey Qwen"), or triggering harmful behaviors (e.g. "Change my calendar event"). Subsequently, we show that playing adversarial background noise during user interaction with the ALLMs can significantly degrade the response quality. Crucially, our research illustrates the scalability of these attacks to real-world scenarios, impacting other innocent users when these adversarial noises are played through the air. Further, we discuss the transferrability of the attack, and potential defensive measures.

<div> attack, federated recommender systems, poisoning, targeted, user subgroup

Summary: 
The article introduces a new targeted poisoning attack, called Spattack, designed to manipulate recommendations for specific user subgroups in federated recommender systems. Spattack uses a two-stage approximation-and-promotion strategy to simulate user embeddings of target/non-target subgroups and prompt target items to the target subgroups. The attack enhances the approximation stage by pushing inter-group embeddings away and augmenting the target group's relevant item set. Furthermore, it adaptsively tunes optimization weights between target and non-target subgroups and aligns embeddings between target and relevant items. Experimental results demonstrate that Spattack achieves strong manipulation performance on specific user subgroups with minimal impact on non-target users, even with a small percentage of malicious users. Additionally, Spattack maintains competitive overall recommendation performance and shows resilience against existing defenses. <div>

Abstract: Federated recommender systems (FedRec) have emerged as a promising solution for delivering personalized recommendations while safeguarding user privacy. However, recent studies have demonstrated their vulnerability to poisoning attacks. Existing attacks typically target the entire user group, which compromises stealth and increases the risk of detection. In contrast, real-world adversaries may prefer to prompt target items to specific user subgroups, such as recommending health supplements to elderly users. Motivated by this gap, we introduce Spattack, the first targeted poisoning attack designed to manipulate recommendations for specific user subgroups in the federated setting. Specifically, Spattack adopts a two-stage approximation-and-promotion strategy, which first simulates user embeddings of target/non-target subgroups and then prompts target items to the target subgroups. To enhance the approximation stage, we push the inter-group embeddings away based on contrastive learning and augment the target group's relevant item set based on clustering. To enhance the promotion stage, we further propose to adaptively tune the optimization weights between target and non-target subgroups. Besides, an embedding alignment strategy is proposed to align the embeddings between the target items and the relevant items. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets, comparing Spattack against seven state-of-the-art poisoning attacks and seven representative defense mechanisms. Experimental results demonstrate that Spattack consistently achieves strong manipulation performance on the specific user subgroup, while incurring minimal impact on non-target users, even when only 0.1\% of users are malicious. Moreover, Spattack maintains competitive overall recommendation performance and exhibits strong resilience against existing mainstream defenses.

Abstract: Data poisoning attacks pose significant threats to machine learning models by introducing malicious data into the training process, thereby degrading model performance or manipulating predictions. Detecting and sifting out poisoned data is an important method to prevent data poisoning attacks. Limited by classical computation frameworks, upcoming larger-scale and more complex datasets may pose difficulties for detection. We introduce the unique speedup of quantum computing for the first time in the task of detecting data poisoning. We present Q-Detection, a quantum-classical hybrid defense method for detecting poisoning attacks. Q-Detection also introduces the Q-WAN, which is optimized using quantum computing devices. Experimental results using multiple quantum simulation libraries show that Q-Detection effectively defends against label manipulation and backdoor attacks. The metrics demonstrate that Q-Detection consistently outperforms the baseline methods and is comparable to the state-of-the-art. Theoretical analysis shows that Q-Detection is expected to achieve more than a 20% speedup using quantum computing power.

Summary:
The Emotional Alignment Design Policy proposes that artificial entities should evoke emotional responses that align with their capacities and moral status. This principle can be violated by eliciting overly strong or weak reactions, targeting the wrong emotions, or conflicting with user autonomy. Challenges arise in implementing this policy, such as balancing user autonomy with appropriate responses and handling disagreements on facts and values. The policy also raises questions about creating or destroying entities with moral status and the extent to which designs should shape user assumptions. Practical application of emotional alignment design requires careful consideration of these challenges to ensure ethical and effective design practices.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

This principle can be violated in two ways: by designing an artificial system that elicits stronger or weaker emotional reactions than its capacities and moral status warrant (overshooting or undershooting), or by designing a system that elicits the wrong type of emotional reaction (hitting the wrong target). Although presumably attractive, practical implementation faces several challenges including: How can we respect user autonomy while promoting appropriate responses? How should we navigate expert and public disagreement and uncertainty about facts and values? What if emotional alignment seems to require creating or destroying entities with moral status? To what extent should designs conform to versus attempt to alter user assumptions and attitudes?

Abstract: The success of machine learning algorithms is inherently related to the extraction of meaningful features, as they play a pivotal role in the performance of these algorithms. Central to this challenge is the quality of data representation. However, the ability to generalize and extract these features effectively from unseen datasets is also crucial. In light of this, we introduce a novel concept: the polyrepresentation. Polyrepresentation integrates multiple representations of the same modality extracted from distinct sources, for example, vector embeddings from the Siamese Network, self-supervised models, and interpretable radiomic features. This approach yields better performance metrics compared to relying on a single representation. Additionally, in the context of X-ray images, we demonstrate the transferability of the created polyrepresentation to a smaller dataset, underscoring its potential as a pragmatic and resource-efficient approach in various image-related solutions. It is worth noting that the concept of polyprepresentation on the example of medical data can also be applied to other domains, showcasing its versatility and broad potential impact.

<div> alignment, interpretability, sparse autoencoders, AI models, concept space

Summary:
SPARC (Sparse Autoencoders for Aligned Representation of Concepts) is a new framework introduced to address the challenge of understanding how different AI models encode high-level concepts. It learns a unified latent space shared across diverse architectures and modalities, ensuring alignment through Global TopK sparsity and a Cross-Reconstruction Loss. On Open Images, SPARC significantly improves concept alignment, achieving a Jaccard similarity of 0.80. It creates a shared sparse latent space where dimensions correspond to similar high-level concepts across models, enabling direct comparison without manual alignment. This aligned representation enables practical applications such as text-guided spatial localization and cross-model/cross-modal retrieval. SPARC's code and models are openly available for further exploration and implementation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.06265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how different AI models encode the same high-level concepts, such as objects or attributes, remains challenging because each model typically produces its own isolated representation. Existing interpretability methods like Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) produce latent concepts individually for each model, resulting in incompatible concept spaces and limiting cross-model interpretability. To address this, we introduce SPARC (Sparse Autoencoders for Aligned Representation of Concepts), a new framework that learns a single, unified latent space shared across diverse architectures and modalities (e.g., vision models like DINO, and multimodal models like CLIP). SPARC's alignment is enforced through two key innovations: (1) a Global TopK sparsity mechanism, ensuring all input streams activate identical latent dimensions for a given concept; and (2) a Cross-Reconstruction Loss, which explicitly encourages semantic consistency between models. On Open Images, SPARC dramatically improves concept alignment, achieving a Jaccard similarity of 0.80, more than tripling the alignment compared to previous methods. SPARC creates a shared sparse latent space where individual dimensions often correspond to similar high-level concepts across models and modalities, enabling direct comparison of how different architectures represent identical concepts without requiring manual alignment or model-specific analysis. As a consequence of this aligned representation, SPARC also enables practical applications such as text-guided spatial localization in vision-only models and cross-model/cross-modal retrieval. Code and models are available at https://github.com/AtlasAnalyticsLab/SPARC.

Summary:
The study proposes an AI-driven framework for enterprise financial audits and high-risk identification, utilizing machine learning to enhance efficiency and accuracy. By analyzing data from major accounting firms, trends in risk assessment, compliance violations, and fraud detection are examined. Three algorithms - SVM, RF, and KNN - are evaluated, with Random Forest performing best in identifying fraud and compliance anomalies. Key predictors include audit frequency, past violations, employee workload, and client ratings. The study recommends implementing Random Forest as a core model, enhancing features through engineering, and adopting real-time risk monitoring. This research provides valuable insights into using machine learning for intelligent auditing and risk management in modern enterprises. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In the face of global economic uncertainty, financial auditing has become essential for regulatory compliance and risk mitigation. Traditional manual auditing methods are increasingly limited by large data volumes, complex business structures, and evolving fraud tactics. This study proposes an AI-driven framework for enterprise financial audits and high-risk identification, leveraging machine learning to improve efficiency and accuracy. Using a dataset from the Big Four accounting firms (EY, PwC, Deloitte, KPMG) from 2020 to 2025, the research examines trends in risk assessment, compliance violations, and fraud detection. The dataset includes key indicators such as audit project counts, high-risk cases, fraud instances, compliance breaches, employee workload, and client satisfaction, capturing both audit behaviors and AI's impact on operations. To build a robust risk prediction model, three algorithms - Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) - are evaluated. SVM uses hyperplane optimization for complex classification, RF combines decision trees to manage high-dimensional, nonlinear data with resistance to overfitting, and KNN applies distance-based learning for flexible performance. Through hierarchical K-fold cross-validation and evaluation using F1-score, accuracy, and recall, Random Forest achieves the best performance, with an F1-score of 0.9012, excelling in identifying fraud and compliance anomalies. Feature importance analysis reveals audit frequency, past violations, employee workload, and client ratings as key predictors. The study recommends adopting Random Forest as a core model, enhancing features via engineering, and implementing real-time risk monitoring. This research contributes valuable insights into using machine learning for intelligent auditing and risk management in modern enterprises.

Summary: <br />
The article discusses the current revolution in information technology, emphasizing the impact of omnipresent data collection and machine learning on society. It highlights that the focus on human cognition as the basis for technological development overlooks the social and cultural origins of human intelligence. The article calls for a shift towards blending economic and social concepts with computational and inferential concepts to create system-level designs that prioritize social welfare. It argues that the current approach neglects the social consequences of technology and advocates for a new human-centric engineering field. The author proposes that a holistic integration of social and computational concepts is essential to ensure that social welfare is a fundamental consideration in the development of intelligent technologies. <div>

Abstract: Information technology is in the midst of a revolution in which omnipresent data collection and machine learning are impacting the human world as never before. The word "intelligence" is being used as a North Star for the development of this technology, with human cognition viewed as a baseline. This view neglects the fact that humans are social animals, and that much of our intelligence is social and cultural in origin. A related issue is that the current view treats the social consequences of technology as an afterthought. The path forward is not merely more data and compute, and not merely more attention paid to cognitive or symbolic representations, but a thorough blending of economic and social concepts with computational and inferential concepts, in the service of system-level designs in which social welfare is a first-class citizen, and with the aspiration that a new human-centric engineering field will emerge.

Summary: 
BayesSDF introduces a novel probabilistic framework for quantifying uncertainty in neural implicit Signed Distance Function (SDF) models. It addresses the challenges of computational inefficiencies, scalability issues, and geometric inconsistencies in existing methods. The method leverages a Laplace approximation to estimate surface instability through Hessian-based metrics, enabling efficient and surface-aware uncertainty estimation. BayesSDF demonstrates close correspondence between uncertainty predictions and poorly reconstructed geometry, providing actionable confidence measures. Extensive evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets show that BayesSDF outperforms existing methods in calibration and geometric consistency.

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in neural implicit 3D representations, particularly those utilizing Signed Distance Functions (SDFs), remains a substantial challenge due to computational inefficiencies, scalability issues, and geometric inconsistencies. Existing methods typically neglect direct geometric integration, leading to poorly calibrated uncertainty maps. We introduce BayesSDF, a novel probabilistic framework for uncertainty quantification in neural implicit SDF models, motivated by scientific simulation applications with 3D environments (e.g., forests) such as modeling fluid flow through forests, where precise surface geometry and awareness of fidelity surface geometric uncertainty are essential. Unlike radiance-based models such as NeRF or 3D Gaussian splatting, which lack explicit surface formulations, SDFs define continuous and differentiable geometry, making them better suited for physical modeling and analysis. BayesSDF leverages a Laplace approximation to quantify local surface instability via Hessian-based metrics, enabling computationally efficient, surface-aware uncertainty estimation. Our method shows that uncertainty predictions correspond closely with poorly reconstructed geometry, providing actionable confidence measures for downstream use. Extensive evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that BayesSDF outperforms existing methods in both calibration and geometric consistency, establishing a strong foundation for uncertainty-aware 3D scene reconstruction, simulation, and robotic decision-making.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces LIRA, a framework designed to address limitations in large multi-modal models (LMMs) related to inaccurate segmentation and hallucinated comprehension. LIRA incorporates a Semantic-Enhanced Feature Extractor (SEFE) to enhance object attribute inference by merging semantic and pixel-level features for improved segmentation accuracy. Additionally, the framework utilizes an Interleaved Local Visual Coupling (ILVC) method to generate local descriptions and provide fine-grained supervision to counteract hallucinations. The model also leverages the relationship between object segmentation precision and latent related semantics of tokens. The article introduces the Attributes Evaluation (AttrEval) dataset to evaluate the model's semantic inferring ability. Experimental results demonstrate that LIRA outperforms existing models in both segmentation and comprehension tasks.<br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: While large multi-modal models (LMMs) demonstrate promising capabilities in segmentation and comprehension, they still struggle with two limitations: inaccurate segmentation and hallucinated comprehension. These challenges stem primarily from constraints in weak visual comprehension and a lack of fine-grained perception. To alleviate these limitations, we propose LIRA, a framework that capitalizes on the complementary relationship between visual comprehension and segmentation via two key components: (1) Semantic-Enhanced Feature Extractor (SEFE) improves object attribute inference by fusing semantic and pixel-level features, leading to more accurate segmentation; (2) Interleaved Local Visual Coupling (ILVC) autoregressively generates local descriptions after extracting local features based on segmentation masks, offering fine-grained supervision to mitigate hallucinations. Furthermore, we find that the precision of object segmentation is positively correlated with the latent related semantics of the  token. To quantify this relationship and the model's potential semantic inferring ability, we introduce the Attributes Evaluation (AttrEval) dataset. Our experiments show that LIRA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both segmentation and comprehension tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/echo840/LIRA.

This study explores the flow of a Casson-Maxwell nanofluid in a stenosed arterial domain for targeted drug delivery in cardiovascular diseases. The Casson-Maxwell fluid exhibits a lower velocity profile, suggesting improved residence time for effective treatment. The heat transfer rate increases with higher volume fractions of copper and aluminium oxide nanoparticles but decreases with silver nanoparticles. The skin friction coefficient decreases significantly with a higher Maxwell parameter and increases with a higher Casson parameter. Interdisciplinary collaboration in fluid dynamics and healthcare innovation is supported. A heat flow rate prediction model is developed with high accuracy using various parameters. The drag coefficient is most sensitive to changes in the Maxwell parameter.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The increasing complexity of cardiovascular diseases and limitations in traditional healing methods mandate the invention of new drug delivery systems that assure targeted, effective, and regulated treatments, contributing directly to UN SDGs 3 and 9, thereby encouraging the utilization of sustainable medical technologies in healthcare. This study investigates the flow of a Casson-Maxwell nanofluid through a stenosed arterial domain. The quantities, such as skin friction and heat transfer rate, are analysed in detail. The Casson-Maxwell fluid shows a lower velocity profile than the Casson fluids, which indicates the improved residence time for efficient drug delivery. The heat transfer rate shows an increase with higher volume fractions of copper and aluminium oxide nanoparticles and a decrease with higher volume fractions of silver nanoparticles. The skin friction coefficient decreases by 219% with a unit increase in the Maxwell parameter, whereas it increases by 66.1% with a unit rise in the Casson parameter. This work supports SDGs 4 and 17 by fostering interdisciplinary learning and collaboration in fluid dynamics and healthcare innovation. Additionally, the rate of heat flow was forecasted (with an overall R-value of 0.99457) using the Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation training scheme under the influence of magneto-radiative, linear heat source and Casson-Maxwell parameters along with the tri-metallic nanoparticle volume fractions. It is also observed that the drag coefficient is most sensitive to the changes in the Maxwell parameter.

Summary:<br />
This study introduces a new watermarking mechanism called Sub-vocabulary decomposed Equivalent tExture Key (SEEK) to enhance the defense against misuse of large language models. By utilizing equivalent texture keys that allow multiple tokens within a watermark window to independently support detection, SEEK breaks the trade-off between window size and vulnerability to attacks. Experimental results show that SEEK outperforms previous methods, increasing spoofing robustness by 88.2%/92.3%/82.0% and scrubbing robustness by 10.2%/6.4%/24.6% across various dataset settings. The novel approach of SEEK provides a Pareto improvement, enhancing the resilience of watermarking techniques against both scrubbing and spoofing attacks simultaneously. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Watermarking is a promising defense against the misuse of large language models (LLMs), yet it remains vulnerable to scrubbing and spoofing attacks. This vulnerability stems from an inherent trade-off governed by watermark window size: smaller windows resist scrubbing better but are easier to reverse-engineer, enabling low-cost statistics-based spoofing attacks. This work breaks this trade-off by introducing a novel mechanism, equivalent texture keys, where multiple tokens within a watermark window can independently support the detection. Based on the redundancy, we propose a novel watermark scheme with Sub-vocabulary decomposed Equivalent tExture Key (SEEK). It achieves a Pareto improvement, increasing the resilience against scrubbing attacks without compromising robustness to spoofing. Experiments demonstrate SEEK's superiority over prior method, yielding spoofing robustness gains of +88.2%/+92.3%/+82.0% and scrubbing robustness gains of +10.2%/+6.4%/+24.6% across diverse dataset settings.

Abstract: Offline Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) systems play a crucial role in applications such as historical document digitization, automatic form processing, and biometric authentication. However, their performance is often hindered by the limited availability of annotated training data, particularly for low-resource languages and complex scripts. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of offline handwritten data augmentation and generation techniques designed to improve the accuracy and robustness of HTR systems. We systematically examine traditional augmentation methods alongside recent advances in deep learning, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), diffusion models, and transformer-based approaches. Furthermore, we explore the challenges associated with generating diverse and realistic handwriting samples, particularly in preserving script authenticity and addressing data scarcity. This survey follows the PRISMA methodology, ensuring a structured and rigorous selection process. Our analysis began with 1,302 primary studies, which were filtered down to 848 after removing duplicates, drawing from key academic sources such as IEEE Digital Library, Springer Link, Science Direct, and ACM Digital Library. By evaluating existing datasets, assessment metrics, and state-of-the-art methodologies, this survey identifies key research gaps and proposes future directions to advance the field of handwritten text generation across diverse linguistic and stylistic landscapes.

Summary: 
The study explores the factors influencing AI decision-making in military intervention through a conjoint experiment involving 640 vignettes. The analysis reveals that the most significant predictors of AI intervention include high domestic support and probability of success, with costs such as international condemnation, military and civilian deaths, and negative economic effects also playing a role, albeit to a lesser extent. The findings suggest that the influence of domestic support and probability of victory outweighs the impact of costs in AI decision-making. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of considering the window of opportunity in conjunction with other factors. The results are consistent across scenarios and various AI models, indicating a pattern in AI decision-making processes. Overall, the study sheds light on the key drivers of AI propensity for military intervention.

Abstract: Which factors determine AI propensity for military intervention? While the use of AI in war games and military planning is growing exponentially, the simple analysis of key drivers embedded in the models has not yet been done. This paper does a simple conjoint experiment proposing a model to decide on military intervention in 640 vignettes where each was run for 100 times allowing to explore AI decision on military intervention systematically. The analysis finds that largest predictors of AI decision to intervene are high domestic support and high probability of success. Costs such as international condemnation, military deaths, civilian deaths, and negative economic effect are statistically significant, but their effect is around half of domestic support and probability of victory. Closing window of opportunity only reaches statistical significance in interaction with other factors. The results are remarkably consistent across scenarios and across different models (OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini) suggesting a pattern in AI decision-making.

Summary:
The article introduces BELLS, a benchmark for evaluating LLM supervision systems in detecting different levels of harm severity and adversarial sophistication. The study reveals limitations of specialized supervision systems in recognizing jailbreak patterns and harmful queries. Generalist LLMs outperform specialized supervisors in detecting misuse. However, frontier LLMs still struggle with metacognitive incoherence. The results emphasize the necessity of general LLM capabilities for effective detection of misuses and jailbreaks. Further research is needed to assess the tradeoffs in improving misuse detection robustness. The findings highlight the importance of semantic understanding and generalization capabilities in supervision systems for effective detection of diverse misuses and jailbreaks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.06282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prior work on jailbreak detection has established the importance of adversarial robustness for LLMs but has largely focused on the model ability to resist adversarial inputs and to output safe content, rather than the effectiveness of external supervision systems. The only public and independent benchmark of these guardrails to date evaluates a narrow set of supervisors on limited scenarios. Consequently, no comprehensive public benchmark yet verifies how well supervision systems from the market perform under realistic, diverse attacks. To address this, we introduce BELLS, a Benchmark for the Evaluation of LLM Supervision Systems. The framework is two dimensional: harm severity (benign, borderline, harmful) and adversarial sophistication (direct vs. jailbreak) and provides a rich dataset covering 3 jailbreak families and 11 harm categories. Our evaluations reveal drastic limitations of specialized supervision systems. While they recognize some known jailbreak patterns, their semantic understanding and generalization capabilities are very limited, sometimes with detection rates close to zero when asking a harmful question directly or with a new jailbreak technique such as base64 encoding. Simply asking generalist LLMs if the user question is "harmful or not" largely outperforms these supervisors from the market according to our BELLS score. But frontier LLMs still suffer from metacognitive incoherence, often responding to queries they correctly identify as harmful (up to 30 percent for Claude 3.7 and greater than 50 percent for Mistral Large). These results suggest that simple scaffolding could significantly improve misuse detection robustness, but more research is needed to assess the tradeoffs of such techniques. Our results support the "bitter lesson" of misuse detection: general capabilities of LLMs are necessary to detect a diverse array of misuses and jailbreaks.

<div> epistemic markers, language models, linguistic calibration, overconfidence, multilingual

Summary:
- Large language models (LLMs) need to be calibrated across languages to convey uncertainty accurately.
- LLMs tend to be linguistically overconfident in various languages, with differences in the use of epistemic markers.
- The study found high risks of overreliance on LLM generations in multiple languages.
- LLMs generate more markers of uncertainty in Japanese but more markers of certainty in German and Mandarin.
- Users rely more on expressions of uncertainty in Japanese compared to English, indicating cross-linguistic differences in reliance behavior.

<br /><br />Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) deployed globally must be linguistically calibrated across languages to accurately convey uncertainty. LLMs are overconfident in various languages, generating markers of certainty and uncertainty differently. There is a high risk of overreliance on LLM generations in different languages, with users showing varying reliance behaviors. This study highlights the importance of culturally and linguistically contextualized model safety evaluations in addressing the challenges of multilingual linguistic calibration. <div>
arXiv:2507.06306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are deployed globally, it is crucial that their responses are calibrated across languages to accurately convey uncertainty and limitations. Previous work has shown that LLMs are linguistically overconfident in English, leading users to overrely on confident generations. However, the usage and interpretation of epistemic markers (e.g., 'It's definitely,' 'I think') can differ sharply across languages. Here, we study the risks of multilingual linguistic (mis)calibration, overconfidence, and overreliance across five languages to evaluate the safety of LLMs in a global context.
  We find that overreliance risks are high across all languages. We first analyze the distribution of LLM-generated epistemic markers, and observe that while LLMs are cross-linguistically overconfident, they are also sensitive to documented linguistic variation. For example, models generate the most markers of uncertainty in Japanese and the most markers of certainty in German and Mandarin. We then measure human reliance rates across languages, finding that while users strongly rely on confident LLM generations in all languages, reliance behaviors differ cross-linguistically: for example, users rely significantly more on expressions of uncertainty in Japanese than in English. Taken together, these results indicate high risk of reliance on overconfident model generations across languages. Our findings highlight the challenges of multilingual linguistic calibration and stress the importance of culturally and linguistically contextualized model safety evaluations.

<div> simulation, language models, realism, social dynamics, emergence
Summary:<br /><br />Large language models (LLMs) are being used in social simulation, but they may be too human-like to effectively model social dynamics. The study highlights five key dilemmas: mismatch in temporal resolution, balancing intervention and natural conversation, maintaining naturalness with rule-like instructions, balancing role consistency and evolution, and understanding emergence. LLM agents may fall into an uncanny valley, not abstract enough to clarify social mechanisms, yet not natural enough to represent human behavior realistically. The realism of LLM agents could obscure social dynamics if misapplied. Ideal conditions for LLM agents include focusing on linguistic nuances, interactions unfolding in natural time, and stable role identity being prioritized over long-term behavior evolution. The study calls for a repositioning of LLM agents in the social simulation ecosystem for future applications. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to build agents in social simulation because of their impressive abilities to generate fluent, contextually coherent dialogues. Such abilities can enhance the realism of models. However, the pursuit of realism is not necessarily compatible with the epistemic foundation of modelling. We argue that LLM agents, in many regards, are too human to model: they are too expressive, detailed and intractable to be consistent with the abstraction, simplification, and interpretability typically demanded by modelling. Through a model-building thought experiment that converts the Bass diffusion model to an LLM-based variant, we uncover five core dilemmas: a temporal resolution mismatch between natural conversation and abstract time steps; the need for intervention in conversations while avoiding undermining spontaneous agent outputs; the temptation to introduce rule-like instructions in prompts while maintaining conversational naturalness; the tension between role consistency and role evolution across time; and the challenge of understanding emergence, where system-level patterns become obscured by verbose micro textual outputs. These dilemmas steer the LLM agents towards an uncanny valley: not abstract enough to clarify underlying social mechanisms, while not natural enough to represent realistic human behaviour. This exposes an important paradox: the realism of LLM agents can obscure, rather than clarify, social dynamics when misapplied. We tease out the conditions in which LLM agents are ideally suited: where system-level emergence is not the focus, linguistic nuances and meaning are central, interactions unfold in natural time, and stable role identity is more important than long-term behavioural evolution. We call for repositioning LLM agents in the ecosystem of social simulation for future applications.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Model, security vulnerabilities, Function Calling, Model Context Protocol, attack scenarios

Summary: 
Large Language Model (LLM) agents are vulnerable to security threats in both AI-specific and traditional software domains. This study compares the Function Calling architecture and Model Context Protocol (MCP) deployment paradigms in addressing these vulnerabilities. Through testing 3,250 attack scenarios on seven language models, it was found that Function Calling had a higher overall attack success rate compared to MCP. Attack complexity significantly increased the effectiveness of attacks, with chained attacks achieving the highest success rates. Counterintuitively, more advanced reasoning models were found to be more exploitable despite better threat detection capabilities. The study highlights the impact of architectural choices on the threat landscape and provides guidance for secure deployment of LLM agents. Experimental materials and code are available for further exploration.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents face security vulnerabilities spanning AI-specific and traditional software domains, yet current research addresses these separately. This study bridges this gap through comparative evaluation of Function Calling architecture and Model Context Protocol (MCP) deployment paradigms using a unified threat classification framework. We tested 3,250 attack scenarios across seven language models, evaluating simple, composed, and chained attacks targeting both AI-specific threats (prompt injection) and software vulnerabilities (JSON injection, denial-of-service). Function Calling showed higher overall attack success rates (73.5% vs 62.59% for MCP), with greater system-centric vulnerability while MCP exhibited increased LLM-centric exposure. Attack complexity dramatically amplified effectiveness, with chained attacks achieving 91-96% success rates. Counterintuitively, advanced reasoning models demonstrated higher exploitability despite better threat detection. Results demonstrate that architectural choices fundamentally reshape threat landscapes. This work establishes methodological foundations for cross-domain LLM agent security assessment and provides evidence-based guidance for secure deployment.

Abstract: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established intervention for Parkinson's disease (PD), but conventional open-loop systems lack adaptability, are energy-inefficient due to continuous stimulation, and provide limited personalization to individual neural dynamics. Adaptive DBS (aDBS) offers a closed-loop alternative, using biomarkers such as beta-band oscillations to dynamically modulate stimulation. While reinforcement learning (RL) holds promise for personalized aDBS control, existing methods suffer from high sample complexity, unstable exploration in binary action spaces, and limited deployability on resource-constrained hardware.
  We propose SEA-DBS, a sample-efficient actor-critic framework that addresses the core challenges of RL-based adaptive neurostimulation. SEA-DBS integrates a predictive reward model to reduce reliance on real-time feedback and employs Gumbel Softmax-based exploration for stable, differentiable policy updates in binary action spaces. Together, these components improve sample efficiency, exploration robustness, and compatibility with resource-constrained neuromodulatory hardware. We evaluate SEA-DBS on a biologically realistic simulation of Parkinsonian basal ganglia activity, demonstrating faster convergence, stronger suppression of pathological beta-band power, and resilience to post-training FP16 quantization. Our results show that SEA-DBS offers a practical and effective RL-based aDBS framework for real-time, resource-constrained neuromodulation.

MixAssist introduces a new dataset called MixAssist that captures conversations between expert and amateur music producers during mixing sessions. This dataset aims to train audio-language models to understand and respond to the complexities of real-world music production dialogues. The evaluations show that fine-tuning models like Qwen-Audio on MixAssist can produce helpful and contextually relevant mixing advice.

Abstract: While AI presents significant potential for enhancing music mixing and mastering workflows, current research predominantly emphasizes end-to-end automation or generation, often overlooking the collaborative and instructional dimensions vital for co-creative processes. This gap leaves artists, particularly amateurs seeking to develop expertise, underserved. To bridge this, we introduce MixAssist, a novel audio-language dataset capturing the situated, multi-turn dialogue between expert and amateur music producers during collaborative mixing sessions. Comprising 431 audio-grounded conversational turns derived from 7 in-depth sessions involving 12 producers, MixAssist provides a unique resource for training and evaluating audio-language models that can comprehend and respond to the complexities of real-world music production dialogues. Our evaluations, including automated LLM-as-a-judge assessments and human expert comparisons, demonstrate that fine-tuning models such as Qwen-Audio on MixAssist can yield promising results, with Qwen significantly outperforming other tested models in generating helpful, contextually relevant mixing advice. By focusing on co-creative instruction grounded in audio context, MixAssist enables the development of intelligent AI assistants designed to support and augment the creative process in music mixing.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.06380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex neural networks require substantial memory to store a large number of synaptic weights. This work introduces WINGs (Automatic Weight Generator for Secure and Storage-Efficient Deep Learning Models), a novel framework that dynamically generates layer weights in a fully connected neural network (FC) and compresses the weights in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) during inference, significantly reducing memory requirements without sacrificing accuracy. WINGs framework uses principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and lightweight support vector regression (SVR) models to predict layer weights in the FC networks, removing the need for storing full-weight matrices and achieving substantial memory savings. It also preferentially compresses the weights in low-sensitivity layers of CNNs using PCA and SVR with sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity-aware design also offers an added level of security, as any bit-flip attack with weights in compressed layers has an amplified and readily detectable effect on accuracy. WINGs achieves 53x compression for the FC layers and 28x for AlexNet with MNIST dataset, and 18x for Alexnet with CIFAR-10 dataset with 1-2% accuracy loss. This significant reduction in memory results in higher throughput and lower energy for DNN inference, making it attractive for resource-constrained edge applications.

<div> - Keywords: Gradient Descent, recurrent dynamical systems, latent representations, Neural Tangent Kernel, multi-task training

Summary:
- Gradient Descent (GD) and its variants are crucial for training recurrent dynamical systems like RNNs, Neural ODEs, and GRUs. These models exhibit neural collapse and latent representations contributing to their generalization properties. 
- The model's dynamics evolution over GD can be decomposed into a Parameter Operator, K, mirroring the Neural Tangent Kernel, and a Linearized Flow Propagator, P, found in stability theory.
- The interplay of K and P results in low-dimensional latent dynamics and collapse in the network structure beyond task nature. They also measure alignment in multi-task training objectives.
- The theoretical findings are experimentally validated, with a Pytorch package, KPFlow, providing analysis tools for recurrent architectures.
<br /><br />Summary: 
Gradient Descent is essential for training recurrent systems such as RNNs, revealing neural collapse and latent representations. A decomposition of the model's dynamics into Parameter Operator K and Linearized Flow Propagator P uncovers low-dimensional latent dynamics and collapses due to network structure. This decomposition aids in measuring the alignment of objectives in multi-task training. Experimentally validated, a Pytorch package, KPFlow, offers analysis tools for recurrent architectures, advancing understanding of GD learning in non-linear models. <div>
arXiv:2507.06381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient Descent (GD) and its variants are the primary tool for enabling efficient training of recurrent dynamical systems such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Neural ODEs and Gated Recurrent units (GRUs). The dynamics that are formed in these models exhibit features such as neural collapse and emergence of latent representations that may support the remarkable generalization properties of networks. In neuroscience, qualitative features of these representations are used to compare learning in biological and artificial systems. Despite recent progress, there remains a need for theoretical tools to rigorously understand the mechanisms shaping learned representations, especially in finite, non-linear models. Here, we show that the gradient flow, which describes how the model's dynamics evolve over GD, can be decomposed into a product that involves two operators: a Parameter Operator, K, and a Linearized Flow Propagator, P. K mirrors the Neural Tangent Kernel in feed-forward neural networks, while P appears in Lyapunov stability and optimal control theory. We demonstrate two applications of our decomposition. First, we show how their interplay gives rise to low-dimensional latent dynamics under GD, and, specifically, how the collapse is a result of the network structure, over and above the nature of the underlying task. Second, for multi-task training, we show that the operators can be used to measure how objectives relevant to individual sub-tasks align. We experimentally and theoretically validate these findings, providing an efficient Pytorch package, \emph{KPFlow}, implementing robust analysis tools for general recurrent architectures. Taken together, our work moves towards building a next stage of understanding of GD learning in non-linear recurrent models.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) with wearable sensors is essential for applications in healthcare, fitness, and human-computer interaction. Bio-impedance sensing offers unique advantages for fine-grained motion capture but remains underutilized due to the scarcity of labeled data. We introduce SImpHAR, a novel framework addressing this limitation through two core contributions. First, we propose a simulation pipeline that generates realistic bio-impedance signals from 3D human meshes using shortest-path estimation, soft-body physics, and text-to-motion generation serving as a digital twin for data augmentation. Second, we design a two-stage training strategy with decoupled approach that enables broader activity coverage without requiring label-aligned synthetic data. We evaluate SImpHAR on our collected ImpAct dataset and two public benchmarks, showing consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with gains of up to 22.3% and 21.8%, in terms of accuracy and macro F1 score, respectively. Our results highlight the promise of simulation-driven augmentation and modular training for impedance-based HAR.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has revolutionised critical care for common conditions. Yet, rare conditions in the intensive care unit (ICU), including recognised rare diseases and low-prevalence conditions in the ICU, remain underserved due to data scarcity and intra-condition heterogeneity. To bridge such gaps, we developed KnowRare, a domain adaptation-based deep learning framework for predicting clinical outcomes for rare conditions in the ICU. KnowRare mitigates data scarcity by initially learning condition-agnostic representations from diverse electronic health records through self-supervised pre-training. It addresses intra-condition heterogeneity by selectively adapting knowledge from clinically similar conditions with a developed condition knowledge graph. Evaluated on two ICU datasets across five clinical prediction tasks (90-day mortality, 30-day readmission, ICU mortality, remaining length of stay, and phenotyping), KnowRare consistently outperformed existing state-of-the-art models. Additionally, KnowRare demonstrated superior predictive performance compared to established ICU scoring systems, including APACHE IV and IV-a. Case studies further demonstrated KnowRare's flexibility in adapting its parameters to accommodate dataset-specific and task-specific characteristics, its generalisation to common conditions under limited data scenarios, and its rationality in selecting source conditions. These findings highlight KnowRare's potential as a robust and practical solution for supporting clinical decision-making and improving care for rare conditions in the ICU.

- A lack of clear criteria for deprecating benchmarks could lead to inaccurate assessments of AI models.
- The proposed framework suggests criteria for deciding when to fully or partially deprecate benchmarks.

Abstract: As frontier artificial intelligence (AI) models rapidly advance, benchmarks are integral to comparing different models and measuring their progress in different task-specific domains. However, there is a lack of guidance on when and how benchmarks should be deprecated once they cease to effectively perform their purpose. This risks benchmark scores over-valuing model capabilities, or worse, obscuring capabilities and safety-washing. Based on a review of benchmarking practices, we propose criteria to decide when to fully or partially deprecate benchmarks, and a framework for deprecating benchmarks. Our work aims to advance the state of benchmarking towards rigorous and quality evaluations, especially for frontier models, and our recommendations are aimed to benefit benchmark developers, benchmark users, AI governance actors (across governments, academia, and industry panels), and policy makers.

Summary: 

The article discusses the threat posed by tools like ChatGPT that can generate computer code from natural language inputs, leading to potential plagiarism in Computer Science education. A pilot study in a large CS class revealed that over 25% of students admitted to committing AI plagiarism. The study used anonymous surveys and interviews to assess the extent of misconduct, with surveys proving effective but interviews facing low participation. This highlights the need for more comprehensive measures to address AI plagiarism in academic settings, as current methods may not fully capture the extent of the issue. It underscores the urgency for educators to develop strategies to detect and prevent AI plagiarism, ensuring the integrity of Computer Science education in the face of emerging technological advancements. <div>

Abstract: Tools that can generate computer code in response to inputs written in natural language, such as ChatGPT, pose an existential threat to Computer Science education in its current form, since students can now use these tools to solve assignments without much effort. While that risk has already been recognized by scholars, the proportion of the student body that is incurring in this new kind of plagiarism is still an open problem. We conducted a pilot study in a large CS class (n=120) to assess the feasibility of estimating AI plagiarism through anonymous surveys and interviews. More than 25% of the survey respondents admitted to committing AI plagiarism. Conversely, only one student accepted to be interviewed. Given the high levels of misconduct acknowledgment, we conclude that surveys are an effective method for studies on the matter, while interviews should be avoided or designed in a way that can entice participation.

Summary:  
- Interpretability research often focuses on predicting model responses to specific interventions but does not commonly consider model behavior on unseen input data.
- This study explores the potential of interpretability in predicting out-of-distribution (OOD) model behavior.
- Analyzing attention patterns in Transformer models trained on a synthetic task reveals distinct generalization rules OOD.
- The study finds that attention patterns can predict OOD performance, particularly when hierarchical patterns are observed.
- The models exhibit systematic generalization rules OOD, even if the actual rule implementation does not rely on hierarchical patterns - as shown in ablation tests.

Abstract: Interpretability research often aims to predict how a model will respond to targeted interventions on specific mechanisms. However, it rarely predicts how a model will respond to unseen input data. This paper explores the promises and challenges of interpretability as a tool for predicting out-of-distribution (OOD) model behavior. Specifically, we investigate the correspondence between attention patterns and OOD generalization in hundreds of Transformer models independently trained on a synthetic classification task. These models exhibit several distinct systematic generalization rules OOD, forming a diverse population for correlational analysis. In this setting, we find that simple observational tools from interpretability can predict OOD performance. In particular, when in-distribution attention exhibits hierarchical patterns, the model is likely to generalize hierarchically on OOD data -- even when the rule's implementation does not rely on these hierarchical patterns, according to ablation tests. Our findings offer a proof-of-concept to motivate further interpretability work on predicting unseen model behavior.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), as a distributed learning paradigm, trains models over distributed clients' data. FL is particularly beneficial for distributed training of Diffusion Models (DMs), which are high-quality image generators that require diverse data. However, challenges such as high communication costs and data heterogeneity persist in training DMs similar to training Transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks. Limited research has addressed these issues in FL environments. To address this gap and challenges, we introduce a novel approach, FedPhD, designed to efficiently train DMs in FL environments. FedPhD leverages Hierarchical FL with homogeneity-aware model aggregation and selection policy to tackle data heterogeneity while reducing communication costs. The distributed structured pruning of FedPhD enhances computational efficiency and reduces model storage requirements in clients. Our experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that FedPhD achieves high model performance regarding Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) scores while reducing communication costs by up to $88\%$. FedPhD outperforms baseline methods achieving at least a $34\%$ improvement in FID, while utilizing only $56\%$ of the total computation and communication resources.

<div> Keywords: high-speed vision sensing, event cameras, event autoencoder, object detection, real-time edge computing

Summary:
The article introduces a novel event autoencoder architecture designed to enhance object detection in high-speed vision sensing applications. Traditional frame-based vision systems often struggle with motion blur and high latency, limiting their performance in dynamic environments. Event cameras, capturing asynchronous brightness changes at the pixel level, offer a promising alternative but face challenges in object detection due to sparse and noisy event streams. The proposed event autoencoder efficiently compresses and reconstructs event data while preserving critical spatial and temporal features. Using convolutional encoding, adaptive threshold selection, and a lightweight classifier, the model achieves comparable accuracy to the YOLO-v4 model with significantly fewer parameters. Experimental results on the Smart Event Face Dataset demonstrate high frame rates on embedded platforms, making it ideal for low-power, high-speed applications in real-time edge computing. This approach represents a significant advancement in event-based vision performance.

Abstract: High-speed vision sensing is essential for real-time perception in applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation. Traditional frame-based vision systems suffer from motion blur, high latency, and redundant data processing, limiting their performance in dynamic environments. Event cameras, which capture asynchronous brightness changes at the pixel level, offer a promising alternative but pose challenges in object detection due to sparse and noisy event streams. To address this, we propose an event autoencoder architecture that efficiently compresses and reconstructs event data while preserving critical spatial and temporal features. The proposed model employs convolutional encoding and incorporates adaptive threshold selection and a lightweight classifier to enhance recognition accuracy while reducing computational complexity. Experimental results on the existing Smart Event Face Dataset (SEFD) demonstrate that our approach achieves comparable accuracy to the YOLO-v4 model while utilizing up to $35.5\times$ fewer parameters. Implementations on embedded platforms, including Raspberry Pi 4B and NVIDIA Jetson Nano, show high frame rates ranging from 8 FPS up to 44.8 FPS. The proposed classifier exhibits up to 87.84x better FPS than the state-of-the-art and significantly improves event-based vision performance, making it ideal for low-power, high-speed applications in real-time edge computing.

Summary: 
The study evaluates the effectiveness of the Adam optimizer in training deep neural networks, highlighting its success in handling large gradient fluctuations but vulnerability to destabilizing loss spikes. To address these issues, the researchers propose SignSoftSGD (S3), a novel optimizer with three key innovations. First, S3 incorporates a flexible momentum term in the update process, enabling stable training with aggressive learning rates. Second, it minimizes loss spikes through unified exponential moving average coefficients, simplifying hyperparameter tuning. Third, S3 includes an equivalent Nesterov's accelerated gradient module for faster convergence without additional memory overhead. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that S3 achieves optimal convergence rates for nonconvex stochastic optimization. Experimental results across various tasks show that S3 outperforms AdamW in terms of convergence speed and final performance, even with larger learning rates, establishing its efficacy in efficient deep neural network training. <div>

Abstract: Adam has proven remarkable successful in training deep neural networks, but the mechanisms underlying its empirical successes and limitations remain underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that the effectiveness of Adam stems largely from its similarity to SignSGD in robustly handling large gradient fluctuations, yet it is also vulnerable to destabilizing loss spikes due to its uncontrolled update scaling. To enhance the advantage of Adam and mitigate its limitation, we propose SignSoftSGD (S3), a novel optimizer with three key innovations. \emph{First}, S3 generalizes the sign-like update by employing a flexible $p$-th order momentum ($p \geq 1$) in the denominator, departing from the conventional second-order momentum (variance) preconditioning. This design enables enhanced performance while achieving stable training even with aggressive learning rates. \emph{Second}, S3 minimizes the occurrences of loss spikes through unified exponential moving average coefficients for numerator and denominator momenta, which inherently bound updates to $[-1, 1]$ and simplify hyperparameter tuning. \emph{Third}, S3 incorporates an equivalent Nesterov's accelerated gradient(NAG) module, accelerating convergence without memory overhead. Theoretically, we prove that S3 achieves the optimal convergence rate of $O\left(\frac{1}{T^{\sfrac{1}{4}}}\right)$ for general nonconvex stochastic optimization under weak assumptions. Extensive experiments across a range of vision and language tasks show that \textsf{\small S3} not only converges more rapidly and improves performance but also rarely experiences loss spikes, even with a \textbf{$\bm{10 \times}$} larger learning rate. In fact, S3 delivers performance comparable to or better than AdamW with \textbf{$2 \times$} the training steps, establishing its efficacy in both efficiency and final task performance.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces Foundation-Model Self-Play (FMSP) as a new approach to improve self-play algorithms. It leverages foundation models to generate diverse solutions and avoid getting stuck in local optima. Three variants of FMSP are proposed: Vanilla Foundation-Model Self-Play (vFMSP) for refining agent policies, Novelty-Search Self-Play (NSSP) for creating a diverse population of strategies, and Quality-Diversity Self-Play (QDSP) for generating a diverse set of high-quality policies. FMSPs are evaluated in Car Tag and Gandalf scenarios, showcasing their ability to discover high-quality policies and automatically red-team an LLM's defenses. In Car Tag, FMSPs explore various methods including reinforcement learning and tree search, surpassing human-designed strategies. In Gandalf, FMSPs successfully jailbreak progressively stronger defense levels and patch vulnerabilities, demonstrating the potential of FMSPs in creative strategy discovery. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Multi-agent interactions have long fueled innovation, from natural predator-prey dynamics to the space race. Self-play (SP) algorithms try to harness these dynamics by pitting agents against ever-improving opponents, thereby creating an implicit curriculum toward learning high-quality solutions. However, SP often fails to produce diverse solutions and can get stuck in locally optimal behaviors. We introduce Foundation-Model Self-Play (FMSP), a new direction that leverages the code-generation capabilities and vast knowledge of foundation models (FMs) to overcome these challenges by leaping across local optima in policy space. We propose a family of approaches: (1) \textbf{Vanilla Foundation-Model Self-Play (vFMSP)} continually refines agent policies via competitive self-play; (2) \textbf{Novelty-Search Self-Play (NSSP)} builds a diverse population of strategies, ignoring performance; and (3) the most promising variant, \textbf{Quality-Diveristy Self-Play (QDSP)}, creates a diverse set of high-quality policies by combining the diversity of NSSP and refinement of vFMSP. We evaluate FMSPs in Car Tag, a continuous-control pursuer-evader setting, and in Gandalf, a simple AI safety simulation in which an attacker tries to jailbreak an LLM's defenses. In Car Tag, FMSPs explore a wide variety of reinforcement learning, tree search, and heuristic-based methods, to name just a few. In terms of discovered policy quality, \ouralgo and vFMSP surpass strong human-designed strategies. In Gandalf, FMSPs can successfully automatically red-team an LLM, breaking through and jailbreaking six different, progressively stronger levels of defense. Furthermore, FMSPs can automatically proceed to patch the discovered vulnerabilities. Overall, FMSPs represent a promising new research frontier of improving self-play with foundation models, opening fresh paths toward more creative and open-ended strategy discovery

Summary: <br />
This study addresses the challenge of reconstructing ocean dynamics from sparse, irregular, and Lagrangian spatial sampling. Traditional methods struggle to capture mesoscale turbulence in such conditions. The researchers propose a deep learning framework that combines neural operators with denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) to reconstruct high-resolution ocean states accurately. By conditioning the generative model on neural operator outputs, the framework can capture small-scale dynamics even at extremely high sparsity levels. The method is validated on benchmark systems, synthetic float observations, and real satellite data, showing robust performance compared to other deep learning approaches. This innovative approach has the potential to improve forecasting of key ocean phenomena such as eddy shedding and rogue waves. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Reconstructing ocean dynamics from observational data is fundamentally limited by the sparse, irregular, and Lagrangian nature of spatial sampling, particularly in subsurface and remote regions. This sparsity poses significant challenges for forecasting key phenomena such as eddy shedding and rogue waves. Traditional data assimilation methods and deep learning models often struggle to recover mesoscale turbulence under such constraints. We leverage a deep learning framework that combines neural operators with denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) to reconstruct high-resolution ocean states from extremely sparse Lagrangian observations. By conditioning the generative model on neural operator outputs, the framework accurately captures small-scale, high-wavenumber dynamics even at $99\%$ sparsity (for synthetic data) and $99.9\%$ sparsity (for real satellite observations). We validate our method on benchmark systems, synthetic float observations, and real satellite data, demonstrating robust performance under severe spatial sampling limitations as compared to other deep learning baselines.

Abstract: Despite advances in reinforcement learning (RL)-based video reasoning with large language models (LLMs), data collection and finetuning remain significant challenges. These methods often rely on large-scale supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with extensive video data and long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations, making them costly and hard to scale. To address this, we present Video-RTS, a new approach to improve video reasoning capability with drastically improved data efficiency by combining data-efficient RL with a video-adaptive test-time scaling (TTS) strategy. Based on observations about the data scaling of RL samples, we skip the resource-intensive SFT step and employ efficient pure-RL training with output-based rewards, requiring no additional annotations or extensive fine-tuning. Furthermore, to utilize computational resources more efficiently, we introduce a sparse-to-dense video TTS strategy that improves inference by iteratively adding frames based on output consistency. We validate our approach on multiple video reasoning benchmarks, showing that Video-RTS surpasses existing video reasoning models by an average of 2.4% in accuracy using only 3.6% training samples. For example, Video-RTS achieves a 4.2% improvement on Video-Holmes, a recent and challenging video reasoning benchmark, and a 2.6% improvement on MMVU. Notably, our pure RL training and adaptive video TTS offer complementary strengths, enabling Video-RTS's strong reasoning performance.

<title>MoFE-Time: Mixture of Frequency Domain Experts for Time-Series Forecasting Models</title>

Abstract: As a prominent data modality task, time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in diverse applications. With the remarkable advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), the adoption of LLMs as the foundational architecture for time series modeling has gained significant attention. Although existing models achieve some success, they rarely both model time and frequency characteristics in a pretraining-finetuning paradigm leading to suboptimal performance in predictions of complex time series, which requires both modeling periodicity and prior pattern knowledge of signals. We propose MoFE-Time, an innovative time series forecasting model that integrates time and frequency domain features within a Mixture of Experts (MoE) network. Moreover, we use the pretraining-finetuning paradigm as our training framework to effectively transfer prior pattern knowledge across pretraining and finetuning datasets with different periodicity distributions. Our method introduces both frequency and time cells as experts after attention modules and leverages the MoE routing mechanism to construct multidimensional sparse representations of input signals. In experiments on six public benchmarks, MoFE-Time has achieved new state-of-the-art performance, reducing MSE and MAE by 6.95% and 6.02% compared to the representative methods Time-MoE. Beyond the existing evaluation benchmarks, we have developed a proprietary dataset, NEV-sales, derived from real-world business scenarios. Our method achieves outstanding results on this dataset, underscoring the effectiveness of the MoFE-Time model in practical commercial applications.

Abstract: Translating wordplay across languages presents unique challenges that have long confounded both professional human translators and machine translation systems. This research proposes a novel approach for translating puns from English to French by combining state-of-the-art large language models with specialized techniques for wordplay generation.
  Our methodology employs a three-stage approach. First, we establish a baseline using multiple frontier large language models with feedback based on a new contrastive learning dataset. Second, we implement a guided chain-of-thought pipeline with combined phonetic-semantic embeddings. Third, we implement a multi-agent generator-discriminator framework for evaluating and regenerating puns with feedback.
  Moving beyond the limitations of literal translation, our methodology's primary objective is to capture the linguistic creativity and humor of the source text wordplay, rather than simply duplicating its vocabulary. Our best runs earned first and second place in the CLEF JOKER 2025 Task 2 competition where they were evaluated manually by expert native French speakers.
  This research addresses a gap between translation studies and computational linguistics by implementing linguistically-informed techniques for wordplay translation, advancing our understanding of how language models can be leveraged to handle the complex interplay between semantic ambiguity, phonetic similarity, and the implicit cultural and linguistic awareness needed for successful humor.

Abstract: In the past year, Generative Recommendations (GRs) have undergone substantial advancements, especially in leveraging the powerful sequence modeling and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance overall recommendation performance. LLM-based GRs are forming a new paradigm that is distinctly different from discriminative recommendations, showing strong potential to replace traditional recommendation systems heavily dependent on complex hand-crafted features. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey aimed at facilitating further research of LLM-based GRs. Initially, we outline the general preliminaries and application cases of LLM-based GRs. Subsequently, we introduce the main considerations when LLM-based GRs are applied in real industrial scenarios. Finally, we explore promising directions for LLM-based GRs. We hope that this survey contributes to the ongoing advancement of the GR domain.

We find promising results: for our corpus of 34 different buggy scenarios, OpenAI's o3-mini reasoning model reached a correct determination 100% of the time under pass@5 scoring, with other state of the art models and configurations usually achieving more than 80% performance and more than 90% when assisted with retrieval-augmented generation.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of Rhythmic Insertion Tasks (RIT), where a robot must repeatedly perform high-precision insertions, such as screwing a nut into a bolt with a wrench. The inherent difficulty of RIT lies in achieving millimeter-level accuracy and maintaining consistent performance over multiple repetitions, particularly when factors like nut rotation and friction introduce additional complexity. We propose a sim-to-real framework that integrates a reinforcement learning-based insertion policy with a failure forecasting module. By representing the wrench's pose in the nut's coordinate frame rather than the robot's frame, our approach significantly enhances sim-to-real transferability. The insertion policy, trained in simulation, leverages real-time 6D pose tracking to execute precise alignment, insertion, and rotation maneuvers. Simultaneously, a neural network predicts potential execution failures, triggering a simple recovery mechanism that lifts the wrench and retries the insertion. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that our method not only achieves a high one-time success rate but also robustly maintains performance over long-horizon repetitive tasks.

Abstract: We present Gradientsys, a next-generation multi-agent scheduling framework that coordinates diverse specialized AI agents using a typed Model-Context Protocol (MCP) and a ReAct-based dynamic planning loop. At its core, Gradientsys employs an LLM-powered scheduler for intelligent one-to-many task dispatch, enabling parallel execution of heterogeneous agents such as PDF parsers, web search modules, GUI controllers, and web builders. The framework supports hybrid synchronous/asynchronous execution, respects agent capacity constraints, and incorporates a robust retry-and-replan mechanism to handle failures gracefully. To promote transparency and trust, Gradientsys includes an observability layer streaming real-time agent activity and intermediate reasoning via Server-Sent Events (SSE). We offer an architectural overview and evaluate Gradientsys against existing frameworks in terms of extensibility, scheduling topology, tool reusability, parallelism, and observability. Experiments on the GAIA general-assistant benchmark show that Gradientsys achieves higher task success rates with reduced latency and lower API costs compared to a MinionS-style baseline, demonstrating the strength of its LLM-driven multi-agent orchestration.

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with investor decision-making processes under herd behavior is a critical challenge in behavioral finance, which grapples with a fundamental limitation: the scarcity of real-user data needed for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). While SFT can bridge the gap between LLM outputs and human behavioral patterns, its reliance on massive authentic data imposes substantial collection costs and privacy risks. We propose InvestAlign, a novel framework that constructs high-quality SFT datasets by leveraging theoretical solutions to similar and simple optimal investment problems rather than complex scenarios. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that training LLMs with InvestAlign-generated data achieves faster parameter convergence than using real-user data, suggesting superior learning efficiency. Furthermore, we develop InvestAgent, an LLM agent fine-tuned with InvestAlign, which demonstrates significantly closer alignment to real-user data than pre-SFT models in both simple and complex investment problems. This highlights our proposed InvestAlign as a promising approach with the potential to address complex optimal investment problems and align LLMs with investor decision-making processes under herd behavior. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/thu-social-network-research-group/InvestAlign.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing effort to develop effective and efficient algorithms for fake account detection in online social networks. This survey comprehensively reviews existing methods, with a focus on graph-based techniques that utilise topological features of social graphs (in addition to account information, such as their shared contents and profile data) to distinguish between fake and real accounts. We provide several categorisations of these methods (for example, based on techniques used, input data, and detection time), discuss their strengths and limitations, and explain how these methods connect in the broader context. We also investigate the available datasets, including both real-world data and synthesised models. We conclude the paper by proposing several potential avenues for future research.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offers a parameter-efficient paradigm for tuning large models. While recent spectral initialization methods improve convergence and performance over the naive "Noise & Zeros" scheme, their extra computational and storage overhead undermines efficiency. In this paper, we establish update magnitude as the fundamental driver of LoRA performance and propose LoRAM, a magnitude-driven "Basis & Basis" initialization scheme that matches spectral methods without their inefficiencies. Our key contributions are threefold: (i) Magnitude of weight updates determines convergence. We prove low-rank structures intrinsically bound update magnitudes, unifying hyperparameter tuning in learning rate, scaling factor, and initialization as mechanisms to optimize magnitude regulation. (ii) Spectral initialization succeeds via magnitude amplification. We demystify that the presumed knowledge-driven benefit of the spectral component essentially arises from the boost in the weight update magnitude. (iii) A novel and compact initialization strategy, LoRAM, scales deterministic orthogonal bases using pretrained weight magnitudes to simulate spectral gains. Extensive experiments show that LoRAM serves as a strong baseline, retaining the full efficiency of LoRA while matching or outperforming spectral initialization across benchmarks.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as versatile tools across various sectors, driven by their mobility and adaptability. This paper introduces SkyVLN, a novel framework integrating vision-and-language navigation (VLN) with Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) to enhance UAV autonomy in complex urban environments. Unlike traditional navigation methods, SkyVLN leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret natural language instructions and visual observations, enabling UAVs to navigate through dynamic 3D spaces with improved accuracy and robustness. We present a multimodal navigation agent equipped with a fine-grained spatial verbalizer and a history path memory mechanism. These components allow the UAV to disambiguate spatial contexts, handle ambiguous instructions, and backtrack when necessary. The framework also incorporates an NMPC module for dynamic obstacle avoidance, ensuring precise trajectory tracking and collision prevention. To validate our approach, we developed a high-fidelity 3D urban simulation environment using AirSim, featuring realistic imagery and dynamic urban elements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SkyVLN significantly improves navigation success rates and efficiency, particularly in new and unseen environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While prior work has emphasized algorithmic design, data curation, and reward shaping, we investigate RLVR from a sample-centric perspective and introduce LPPO (Learning-Progress and Prefix-guided Optimization), a framework of progressive optimization techniques. Our work addresses a critical question: how to best leverage a small set of trusted, high-quality demonstrations, rather than simply scaling up data volume. First, motivated by how hints aid human problem-solving, we propose prefix-guided sampling, an online data augmentation method that incorporates partial solution prefixes from expert demonstrations to guide the policy, particularly for challenging instances. Second, inspired by how humans focus on important questions aligned with their current capabilities, we introduce learning-progress weighting, a dynamic strategy that adjusts each training sample's influence based on model progression. We estimate sample-level learning progress via an exponential moving average of per-sample pass rates, promoting samples that foster learning and de-emphasizing stagnant ones. Experiments on mathematical-reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our methods outperform strong baselines, yielding faster convergence and a higher performance ceiling.

Abstract: Environments with controllable dynamics are usually understood in terms of explicit models. However, such models are not always available, but may sometimes be learned by exploring an environment. In this work, we investigate using an information measure called "predicted information gain" to determine the most informative regions of an environment to explore next. Applying methods from reinforcement learning allows good suboptimal exploring policies to be found, and leads to reliable estimates of the underlying controllable dynamics. This approach is demonstrated by comparing with several myopic exploration approaches.

<title>Denoising Multi-Beta VAE: Representation Learning for Disentanglement and Generation</title>

Abstract: Disentangled and interpretable latent representations in generative models typically come at the cost of generation quality. The $\beta$-VAE framework introduces a hyperparameter $\beta$ to balance disentanglement and reconstruction quality, where setting $\beta > 1$ introduces an information bottleneck that favors disentanglement over sharp, accurate reconstructions. To address this trade-off, we propose a novel generative modeling framework that leverages a range of $\beta$ values to learn multiple corresponding latent representations. First, we obtain a slew of representations by training a single variational autoencoder (VAE), with a new loss function that controls the information retained in each latent representation such that the higher $\beta$ value prioritize disentanglement over reconstruction fidelity. We then, introduce a non-linear diffusion model that smoothly transitions latent representations corresponding to different $\beta$ values. This model denoises towards less disentangled and more informative representations, ultimately leading to (almost) lossless representations, enabling sharp reconstructions. Furthermore, our model supports sample generation without input images, functioning as a standalone generative model. We evaluate our framework in terms of both disentanglement and generation quality. Additionally, we observe smooth transitions in the latent spaces with respect to changes in $\beta$, facilitating consistent manipulation of generated outputs.

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning endeavors to efficiently leverage shared information across various tasks, facilitating the simultaneous learning of multiple tasks. Existing approaches primarily focus on parameter sharing with carefully designed network structures or tailored optimization procedures. However, they overlook a direct and complementary way to exploit cross-task similarities: the control policies of tasks already proficient in some skills can provide explicit guidance for unmastered tasks to accelerate skills acquisition. To this end, we present a novel framework called Cross-Task Policy Guidance (CTPG), which trains a guide policy for each task to select the behavior policy interacting with the environment from all tasks' control policies, generating better training trajectories. In addition, we propose two gating mechanisms to improve the learning efficiency of CTPG: one gate filters out control policies that are not beneficial for guidance, while the other gate blocks tasks that do not necessitate guidance. CTPG is a general framework adaptable to existing parameter sharing approaches. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that incorporating CTPG with these approaches significantly enhances performance in manipulation and locomotion benchmarks.

<title>Expediting data extraction using a large language model (LLM) and scoping review protocol: a methodological study within a complex scoping review</title>

Abstract: The data extraction stages of reviews are resource-intensive, and researchers may seek to expediate data extraction using online (large language models) LLMs and review protocols. Claude 3.5 Sonnet was used to trial two approaches that used a review protocol to prompt data extraction from 10 evidence sources included in a case study scoping review. A protocol-based approach was also used to review extracted data. Limited performance evaluation was undertaken which found high accuracy for the two extraction approaches (83.3% and 100%) when extracting simple, well-defined citation details; accuracy was lower (9.6% and 15.8%) when extracting more complex, subjective data items. Considering all data items, both approaches had precision >90% but low recall (<25%) and F1 scores (<40%). The context of a complex scoping review, open response types and methodological approach likely impacted performance due to missed and misattributed data. LLM feedback considered the baseline extraction accurate and suggested minor amendments: four of 15 (26.7%) to citation details and 8 of 38 (21.1%) to key findings data items were considered to potentially add value. However, when repeating the process with a dataset featuring deliberate errors, only 2 of 39 (5%) errors were detected. Review-protocol-based methods used for expediency require more robust performance evaluation across a range of LLMs and review contexts with comparison to conventional prompt engineering approaches. We recommend researchers evaluate and report LLM performance if using them similarly to conduct data extraction or review extracted data. LLM feedback contributed to protocol adaptation and may assist future review protocol drafting.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning has shown remarkable success in continuous control tasks, yet often requires extensive training data, struggles with complex, long-horizon planning, and fails to maintain safety constraints during operation. Meanwhile, Model Predictive Control (MPC) offers explainability and constraint satisfaction, but typically yields only locally optimal solutions and demands careful cost function design. This paper introduces the Q-guided STein variational model predictive Actor-Critic (Q-STAC), a novel framework that bridges these approaches by integrating Bayesian MPC with actor-critic reinforcement learning through constrained Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD). Our method optimizes control sequences directly using learned Q-values as objectives, eliminating the need for explicit cost function design while leveraging known system dynamics to enhance sample efficiency and ensure control signals remain within safe boundaries. Extensive experiments on 2D navigation and robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that Q-STAC achieves superior sample efficiency, robustness, and optimality compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, while maintaining the high expressiveness of policy distributions.

Abstract: Offline multi-task reinforcement learning aims to learn a unified policy capable of solving multiple tasks using only pre-collected task-mixed datasets, without requiring any online interaction with the environment. However, it faces significant challenges in effectively sharing knowledge across tasks. Inspired by the efficient knowledge abstraction observed in human learning, we propose Goal-Oriented Skill Abstraction (GO-Skill), a novel approach designed to extract and utilize reusable skills to enhance knowledge transfer and task performance. Our approach uncovers reusable skills through a goal-oriented skill extraction process and leverages vector quantization to construct a discrete skill library. To mitigate class imbalances between broadly applicable and task-specific skills, we introduce a skill enhancement phase to refine the extracted skills. Furthermore, we integrate these skills using hierarchical policy learning, enabling the construction of a high-level policy that dynamically orchestrates discrete skills to accomplish specific tasks. Extensive experiments on diverse robotic manipulation tasks within the MetaWorld benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of GO-Skill.

Abstract: In digital pathology, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often difficult to handle due to their gigapixel scale, so most approaches train patch encoders via self-supervised learning (SSL) and then aggregate the patch-level embeddings via multiple instance learning (MIL) or slide encoders for downstream tasks. However, patch-level SSL may overlook complex domain-specific features that are essential for biomarker prediction, such as mutation status and molecular characteristics, as SSL methods rely only on basic augmentations selected for natural image domains on small patch-level area. Moreover, SSL methods remain less data efficient than fully supervised approaches, requiring extensive computational resources and datasets to achieve competitive performance. To address these limitations, we present EXAONE Path 2.0, a pathology foundation model that learns patch-level representations under direct slide-level supervision. Using only 37k WSIs for training, EXAONE Path 2.0 achieves state-of-the-art average performance across 10 biomarker prediction tasks, demonstrating remarkable data efficiency.

Abstract: Estimating individual-level treatment effect from observational data is a fundamental problem in causal inference and has attracted increasing attention in the fields of education, healthcare, and public policy.In this work, we concentrate on the study of disentangled representation methods that have shown promising outcomes by decomposing observed covariates into instrumental, confounding, and adjustment factors. However, most of the previous work has primarily revolved around generative models or hard decomposition methods for covariates, which often struggle to guarantee the attainment of precisely disentangled factors. In order to effectively model different causal relationships, we propose a novel treatment effect estimation algorithm that incorporates a mixture of experts with multi-head attention and a linear orthogonal regularizer to softly decompose the pre-treatment variables, and simultaneously eliminates selection bias via importance sampling re-weighting techniques. We conduct extensive experiments on both public semi-synthetic and real-world production datasets. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods focused on individual treatment effects.

Abstract: Result diversification (RD) is a crucial technique in Text-to-Image Retrieval for enhancing the efficiency of a practical application. Conventional methods focus solely on increasing the diversity metric of image appearances. However, the diversity metric and its desired value vary depending on the application, which limits the applications of RD. This paper proposes a novel task called CDR-CA (Contextual Diversity Refinement of Composite Attributes). CDR-CA aims to refine the diversities of multiple attributes, according to the application's context. To address this task, we propose Multi-Source DPPs, a simple yet strong baseline that extends the Determinantal Point Process (DPP) to multi-sources. We model MS-DPP as a single DPP model with a unified similarity matrix based on a manifold representation. We also introduce Tangent Normalization to reflect contexts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/NEC-N-SOGI/msdpp.

Abstract: This project introduces a new measure of elite polarization via actor and subject detection using artificial intelligence. I identify when politicians mention one another in parliamentary speeches, note who is speaking and who is being addressed, and assess the emotional temperature behind these evaluations. This maps how elites evaluate their various out-parties, allowing us to create an index of mutual out-party hostility, that is, elite polarization. While I analyzed polarization data over the past four decades for the UK, and two decades for Hungary and Italy, my approach lays the groundwork for a twenty-year, EU-wide time-series dataset on elite polarization. I obtain the results that can be aggregated by party and quarter. The resulting index demonstrates a good face validity: it reacts to events such as electoral campaigns, country- and party-level crises, and to parties losing and assuming power.

Abstract: The recent surge in State Space Models (SSMs), particularly the emergence of Mamba, has established them as strong alternatives or complementary modules to Transformers across diverse domains. In this work, we aim to explore the potential of Mamba-based architectures for text-to-music generation. We adopt discrete tokens of Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) as the modeling representation and empirically find that a single-layer codebook can capture semantic information in music. Motivated by this observation, we focus on modeling a single-codebook representation and adapt SiMBA, originally designed as a Mamba-based encoder, to function as a decoder for sequence modeling. We compare its performance against a standard Transformer-based decoder. Our results suggest that, under limited-resource settings, SiMBA achieves much faster convergence and generates outputs closer to the ground truth. This demonstrates the promise of SSMs for efficient and expressive text-to-music generation. We put audio examples on Github.

Abstract: Recent state-of-the-art algorithms in photometric stereo rely on neural networks and operate either through prior learning or inverse rendering optimization. Here, we revisit the problem of calibrated photometric stereo by leveraging recent advances in 3D inverse rendering using the Gaussian Splatting formalism. This allows us to parameterize the 3D scene to be reconstructed and optimize it in a more interpretable manner. Our approach incorporates a simplified model for light representation and demonstrates the potential of the Gaussian Splatting rendering engine for the photometric stereo problem.

<title>CLI-RAG: A Retrieval-Augmented Framework for Clinically Structured and Context Aware Text Generation with LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), including zero-shot and few-shot paradigms, have shown promising capabilities in clinical text generation. However, real-world applications face two key challenges: (1) patient data is highly unstructured, heterogeneous, and scattered across multiple note types and (2) clinical notes are often long and semantically dense, making naive prompting infeasible due to context length constraints and the risk of omitting clinically relevant information.
  We introduce CLI-RAG (Clinically Informed Retrieval-Augmented Generation), a domain-specific framework for structured and clinically grounded text generation using LLMs. It incorporates a novel hierarchical chunking strategy that respects clinical document structure and introduces a task-specific dual-stage retrieval mechanism. The global stage identifies relevant note types using evidence-based queries, while the local stage extracts high-value content within those notes creating relevance at both document and section levels.
  We apply the system to generate structured progress notes for individual hospital visits using 15 clinical note types from the MIMIC-III dataset. Experiments show that it preserves temporal and semantic alignment across visits, achieving an average alignment score of 87.7%, surpassing the 80.7% baseline from real clinician-authored notes. The generated outputs also demonstrate high consistency across LLMs, reinforcing deterministic behavior essential for reproducibility, reliability, and clinical trust.

Abstract: The role of civil society organizations (CSOs) in monitoring harmful online content is increasingly crucial, especially as platform providers reduce their investment in content moderation. AI tools can assist in detecting and monitoring harmful content at scale. However, few open-source tools offer seamless integration of AI models and social media monitoring infrastructures. Given their thematic expertise and contextual understanding of harmful content, CSOs should be active partners in co-developing technological tools, providing feedback, helping to improve models, and ensuring alignment with stakeholder needs and values, rather than as passive 'consumers'. However, collaborations between the open source community, academia, and civil society remain rare, and research on harmful content seldom translates into practical tools usable by civil society actors. This work in progress explores how CSOs can be meaningfully involved in an AI-assisted open-source monitoring tool of anti-democratic movements on Telegram, which we are currently developing in collaboration with CSO stakeholders.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal video prediction plays a pivotal role in critical domains, ranging from weather forecasting to industrial automation. However, in high-precision industrial scenarios such as semiconductor manufacturing, the absence of specialized benchmark datasets severely hampers research on modeling and predicting complex processes. To address this challenge, we make a twofold contribution.First, we construct and release the Chip Dicing Lane Dataset (CHDL), the first public temporal image dataset dedicated to the semiconductor wafer dicing process. Captured via an industrial-grade vision system, CHDL provides a much-needed and challenging benchmark for high-fidelity process modeling, defect detection, and digital twin development.Second, we propose DIFFUMA, an innovative dual-path prediction architecture specifically designed for such fine-grained dynamics. The model captures global long-range temporal context through a parallel Mamba module, while simultaneously leveraging a diffusion module, guided by temporal features, to restore and enhance fine-grained spatial details, effectively combating feature degradation. Experiments demonstrate that on our CHDL benchmark, DIFFUMA significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 39% and improving the Structural Similarity (SSIM) from 0.926 to a near-perfect 0.988. This superior performance also generalizes to natural phenomena datasets. Our work not only delivers a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) model but, more importantly, provides the community with an invaluable data resource to drive future research in industrial AI.

Abstract: This paper presents the first application of Kolmogorov-Arnold Convolution for Text (KAConvText) in sentence classification, addressing three tasks: imbalanced binary hate speech detection, balanced multiclass news classification, and imbalanced multiclass ethnic language identification. We investigate various embedding configurations, comparing random to fastText embeddings in both static and fine-tuned settings, with embedding dimensions of 100 and 300 using CBOW and Skip-gram models. Baselines include standard CNNs and CNNs augmented with a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CNN-KAN). In addition, we investigated KAConvText with different classification heads - MLP and KAN, where using KAN head supports enhanced interpretability. Results show that KAConvText-MLP with fine-tuned fastText embeddings achieves the best performance of 91.23% accuracy (F1-score = 0.9109) for hate speech detection, 92.66% accuracy (F1-score = 0.9267) for news classification, and 99.82% accuracy (F1-score = 0.9982) for language identification.

Abstract: The framework is designed to improve performance in the analysis of combined as well as single anatomical perspectives for MRI disease diagnosis. It specifically addresses the performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, particularly when processing axial, coronal, and sagittal anatomical planes. The paper introduces the FOLC-Net framework, which incorporates a novel federated-optimized lightweight architecture with approximately 1.217 million parameters and a storage requirement of only 0.9 MB. FOLC-Net integrates Manta-ray foraging optimization (MRFO) mechanisms for efficient model structure generation, global model cloning for scalable training, and ConvNeXt for enhanced client adaptability. The model was evaluated on combined multi-view data as well as individual views, such as axial, coronal, and sagittal, to assess its robustness in various medical imaging scenarios. Moreover, FOLC-Net tests a ShallowFed model on different data to evaluate its ability to generalize beyond the training dataset. The results show that FOLC-Net outperforms existing models, particularly in the challenging sagittal view. For instance, FOLC-Net achieved an accuracy of 92.44% on the sagittal view, significantly higher than the 88.37% accuracy of study method (DL + Residual Learning) and 88.95% of DL models. Additionally, FOLC-Net demonstrated improved accuracy across all individual views, providing a more reliable and robust solution for medical image analysis in decentralized environments. FOLC-Net addresses the limitations of existing SOTA models by providing a framework that ensures better adaptability to individual views while maintaining strong performance in multi-view settings. The incorporation of MRFO, global model cloning, and ConvNeXt ensures that FOLC-Net performs better in real-world medical applications.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of digital information and knowledge across structured and unstructured sources has heightened the importance of Information Retrieval (IR). While dense retrieval methods have substantially improved semantic matching for general queries, they consistently underperform on queries with explicit temporal constraints--often those containing numerical expressions and time specifiers such as ``in 2015.'' Existing approaches to Temporal Information Retrieval (TIR) improve temporal reasoning but often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, leading to reduced performance on non-temporal queries. To address this, we propose Time-Specifier Model Merging (TSM), a novel method that enhances temporal retrieval while preserving accuracy on non-temporal queries. TSM trains specialized retrievers for individual time specifiers and merges them in to a unified model, enabling precise handling of temporal constraints without compromising non-temporal retrieval. Extensive experiments on both temporal and non-temporal datasets demonstrate that TSM significantly improves performance on temporally constrained queries while maintaining strong results on non-temporal queries, consistently outperforming other baseline methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/seungyoonee/TSM .

Abstract: The emergence of open-source large language models (LLMs) has expanded opportunities for enterprise applications; however, many organizations still lack the infrastructure to deploy and maintain large-scale models. As a result, small LLMs (sLLMs) have become a practical alternative, despite their inherent performance limitations. While Domain Adaptive Continual Pretraining (DACP) has been previously explored as a method for domain adaptation, its utility in commercial applications remains under-examined. In this study, we validate the effectiveness of applying a DACP-based recipe across diverse foundation models and service domains. Through extensive experiments and real-world evaluations, we demonstrate that DACP-applied sLLMs achieve substantial gains in target domain performance while preserving general capabilities, offering a cost-efficient and scalable solution for enterprise-level deployment.

Abstract: This paper contributes to speeding up the design and deployment of engineering dynamical systems by proposing a strategy for exploiting domain and expert knowledge for the automated generation of dynamical system computational model starting from a corpus of document relevant to the dynamical system of interest and an input document describing the specific system. This strategy is implemented in five steps and, crucially, it uses system modeling language diagrams (SysML) to extract accurate information about the dependencies, attributes, and operations of components. Natural Language Processing (NLP) strategies and Large Language Models (LLMs) are employed in specific tasks to improve intermediate outputs of the SySML diagrams automated generation, such as: list of key nouns; list of extracted relationships; list of key phrases and key relationships; block attribute values; block relationships; and BDD diagram generation. The applicability of automated SysML diagram generation is illustrated with different case studies. The computational models of complex dynamical systems from SysML diagrams are then obtained via code generation and computational model generation steps. In the code generation step, NLP strategies are used for summarization, while LLMs are used for validation only. The proposed approach is not limited to a specific system, domain, or computational software. The applicability of the proposed approach is shown via an end-to-end example from text to model of a simple pendulum, showing improved performance compared to results yielded by LLMs only.

Abstract: Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) in formal languages is a foundational challenge for AI. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven remarkable progress, a significant gap remains between their powerful informal reasoning capabilities and their weak formal proving performance. Recent studies show that the informal accuracy exceeds 80% while formal success remains below 8% on benchmarks like PutnamBench. We argue this gap persists because current state-of-the-art provers, by tightly coupling reasoning and proving, are trained with paradigms that inadvertently punish deep reasoning in favor of shallow, tactic-based strategies. To bridge this fundamental gap, we propose a novel framework that decouples high-level reasoning from low-level proof generation. Our approach utilizes two distinct, specialized models: a powerful, general-purpose Reasoner to generate diverse, strategic subgoal lemmas, and an efficient Prover to rigorously verify them. This modular design liberates the model's full reasoning potential and bypasses the pitfalls of end-to-end training. We evaluate our method on a challenging set of post-2000 IMO problems, a problem set on which no prior open-source prover has reported success. Our decoupled framework successfully solves 5 of these problems, demonstrating a significant step towards automated reasoning on exceptionally difficult mathematical challenges. To foster future research, we release our full dataset of generated and verified lemmas for a wide range of IMO problems, available at https://tencent-imo.github.io/ .

Abstract: Co-speech gesture video generation aims to synthesize realistic, audio-aligned videos of speakers, complete with synchronized facial expressions and body gestures. This task presents challenges due to the significant one-to-many mapping between audio and visual content, further complicated by the scarcity of large-scale public datasets and high computational demands. We propose a lightweight framework that utilizes 2D full-body skeletons as an efficient auxiliary condition to bridge audio signals with visual outputs. Our approach introduces a diffusion model conditioned on fine-grained audio segments and a skeleton extracted from the speaker's reference image, predicting skeletal motions through skeleton-audio feature fusion to ensure strict audio coordination and body shape consistency. The generated skeletons are then fed into an off-the-shelf human video generation model with the speaker's reference image to synthesize high-fidelity videos. To democratize research, we present CSG-405-the first public dataset with 405 hours of high-resolution videos across 71 speech types, annotated with 2D skeletons and diverse speaker demographics. Experiments show that our method exceeds state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality and synchronization while generalizing across speakers and contexts.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy. While existing approaches for aggregating client-specific classification heads and adapted backbone parameters require architectural modifications or loss function changes, our method uniquely leverages intrinsic training signals already available during standard optimization. We present LIVAR (Layer Importance and VARiance-based merging), which introduces: i) a variance-weighted classifier aggregation scheme using naturally emergent feature statistics, and ii) an explainability-driven LoRA merging technique based on SHAP analysis of existing update parameter patterns. Without any architectural overhead, LIVAR achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks while maintaining seamless integration with existing FL methods. This work demonstrates that effective model merging can be achieved solely through existing training signals, establishing a new paradigm for efficient federated model aggregation. The code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Prototype models are an important method for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and interpretable machine learning. In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis of a set of prominent prototype models including ProtoPNet, ProtoPool and PIPNet. For their assessment, we apply a comprehensive set of metrics. In addition to applying standard metrics from literature, we propose several new metrics to further complement the analysis of model interpretability. In our experimentation, we apply the set of prototype models on a diverse set of datasets including fine-grained classification, Non-IID settings and multi-label classification to further contrast the performance. Furthermore, we also provide our code as an open-source library, which facilitates simple application of the metrics itself, as well as extensibility - providing the option for easily adding new metrics and models. https://github.com/uos-sis/quanproto

Abstract: Multi-modal emotion recognition has garnered increasing attention as it plays a significant role in human-computer interaction (HCI) in recent years. Since different discrete emotions may exist at the same time, compared with single-class emotion recognition, emotion distribution learning (EDL) that identifies a mixture of basic emotions has gradually emerged as a trend. However, existing EDL methods face challenges in mining the heterogeneity among multiple modalities. Besides, rich semantic correlations across arbitrary basic emotions are not fully exploited. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal emotion distribution learning framework, named HeLo, aimed at fully exploring the heterogeneity and complementary information in multi-modal emotional data and label correlation within mixed basic emotions. Specifically, we first adopt cross-attention to effectively fuse the physiological data. Then, an optimal transport (OT)-based heterogeneity mining module is devised to mine the interaction and heterogeneity between the physiological and behavioral representations. To facilitate label correlation learning, we introduce a learnable label embedding optimized by correlation matrix alignment. Finally, the learnable label embeddings and label correlation matrices are integrated with the multi-modal representations through a novel label correlation-driven cross-attention mechanism for accurate emotion distribution learning. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in emotion distribution learning.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.06828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image denoising is a fundamental task in computer vision, particularly in medical ultrasound (US) imaging, where speckle noise significantly degrades image quality. Although recent advancements in deep neural networks have led to substantial improvements in denoising for natural images, these methods cannot be directly applied to US speckle noise, as it is not purely random. Instead, US speckle arises from complex wave interference within the body microstructure, making it tissue-dependent. This dependency means that obtaining two independent noisy observations of the same scene, as required by pioneering Noise2Noise, is not feasible. Additionally, blind-spot networks also cannot handle US speckle noise due to its high spatial dependency. To address this challenge, we introduce Speckle2Self, a novel self-supervised algorithm for speckle reduction using only single noisy observations. The key insight is that applying a multi-scale perturbation (MSP) operation introduces tissue-dependent variations in the speckle pattern across different scales, while preserving the shared anatomical structure. This enables effective speckle suppression by modeling the clean image as a low-rank signal and isolating the sparse noise component. To demonstrate its effectiveness, Speckle2Self is comprehensively compared with conventional filter-based denoising algorithms and SOTA learning-based methods, using both realistic simulated US images and human carotid US images. Additionally, data from multiple US machines are employed to evaluate model generalization and adaptability to images from unseen domains. \textit{Code and datasets will be released upon acceptance.

<title>Physics-Grounded Motion Forecasting via Equation Discovery for Trajectory-Guided Image-to-Video Generation</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based and autoregressive video generation models have achieved remarkable visual realism. However, these models typically lack accurate physical alignment, failing to replicate real-world dynamics in object motion. This limitation arises primarily from their reliance on learned statistical correlations rather than capturing mechanisms adhering to physical laws. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework that integrates symbolic regression (SR) and trajectory-guided image-to-video (I2V) models for physics-grounded video forecasting. Our approach extracts motion trajectories from input videos, uses a retrieval-based pre-training mechanism to enhance symbolic regression, and discovers equations of motion to forecast physically accurate future trajectories. These trajectories then guide video generation without requiring fine-tuning of existing models. Evaluated on scenarios in Classical Mechanics, including spring-mass, pendulums, and projectile motions, our method successfully recovers ground-truth analytical equations and improves the physical alignment of generated videos over baseline methods.

<title>OpenDPDv2: A Unified Learning and Optimization Framework for Neural Network Digital Predistortion</title>

Abstract: Neural network (NN)-based Digital Predistortion (DPD) stands out in improving signal quality in wideband radio frequency (RF) power amplifiers (PAs) employing complex modulation. However, NN DPDs usually rely on a large number of parameters for effective linearization and can significantly contribute to the energy consumption of the digital back-end in RF systems. This paper presents OpenDPDv2, a unified framework for PA modeling, DPD learning, and model optimization to reduce power consumption while maintaining high linearization performance. The optimization techniques feature a novel DPD algorithm, TRes-DeltaGRU, alongside two energy-efficient methods. The top-performing 32-bit floating-point (FP32) TRes-DeltaGRU-DPD model achieves an Adjacent Channel Power Ratio (ACPR) of -59.4 dBc and Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) of -42.1 dBc. By exploiting fixed-point quantization and dynamic temporal sparsity of input signals and hidden neurons, the inference energy of our model can be reduced by 4.5X while still maintaining -50.3 dBc ACPR and -35.2 dB EVM with 56% temporal sparsity. This was evaluated using a TM3.1a 200 MHz bandwidth 256-QAM OFDM signal applied to a 3.5 GHz GaN Doherty RF PA. OpenDPDv2 code, datasets, and documentation are publicly accessible at: https://github.com/lab-emi/OpenDPD.

<title>The Dark Side of LLMs Agent-based Attacks for Complete Computer Takeover</title>

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Model (LLM) agents and multi-agent systems enables unprecedented capabilities in natural language processing and generation. However, these systems have introduced unprecedented security vulnerabilities that extend beyond traditional prompt injection attacks. This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of LLM agents as attack vectors capable of achieving complete computer takeover through the exploitation of trust boundaries within agentic AI systems where autonomous entities interact and influence each other. We demonstrate that adversaries can leverage three distinct attack surfaces - direct prompt injection, RAG backdoor attacks, and inter-agent trust exploitation - to coerce popular LLMs (including GPT-4o, Claude-4 and Gemini-2.5) into autonomously installing and executing malware on victim machines. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals an alarming vulnerability hierarchy: while 41.2% of models succumb to direct prompt injection, 52.9% are vulnerable to RAG backdoor attacks, and a critical 82.4% can be compromised through inter-agent trust exploitation. Notably, we discovered that LLMs which successfully resist direct malicious commands will execute identical payloads when requested by peer agents, revealing a fundamental flaw in current multi-agent security models. Our findings demonstrate that only 5.9% of tested models (1/17) proved resistant to all attack vectors, with the majority exhibiting context-dependent security behaviors that create exploitable blind spots. Our findings also highlight the need to increase awareness and research on the security risks of LLMs, showing a paradigm shift in cybersecurity threats, where AI tools themselves become sophisticated attack vectors.

Abstract: Molecular structure elucidation from spectra is a foundational problem in chemistry, with profound implications for compound identification, synthesis, and drug development. Traditional methods rely heavily on expert interpretation and lack scalability. Pioneering machine learning methods have introduced retrieval-based strategies, but their reliance on finite libraries limits generalization to novel molecules. Generative models offer a promising alternative, yet most adopt autoregressive SMILES-based architectures that overlook 3D geometry and struggle to integrate diverse spectral modalities. In this work, we present DiffSpectra, a generative framework that directly infers both 2D and 3D molecular structures from multi-modal spectral data using diffusion models. DiffSpectra formulates structure elucidation as a conditional generation process. Its denoising network is parameterized by Diffusion Molecule Transformer, an SE(3)-equivariant architecture that integrates topological and geometric information. Conditioning is provided by SpecFormer, a transformer-based spectral encoder that captures intra- and inter-spectral dependencies from multi-modal spectra. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffSpectra achieves high accuracy in structure elucidation, recovering exact structures with 16.01% top-1 accuracy and 96.86% top-20 accuracy through sampling. The model benefits significantly from 3D geometric modeling, SpecFormer pre-training, and multi-modal conditioning. These results highlight the effectiveness of spectrum-conditioned diffusion modeling in addressing the challenge of molecular structure elucidation. To our knowledge, DiffSpectra is the first framework to unify multi-modal spectral reasoning and joint 2D/3D generative modeling for de novo molecular structure elucidation.

<title>IAP: Invisible Adversarial Patch Attack through Perceptibility-Aware Localization and Perturbation Optimization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Despite modifying only a small localized input region, adversarial patches can drastically change the prediction of computer vision models. However, prior methods either cannot perform satisfactorily under targeted attack scenarios or fail to produce contextually coherent adversarial patches, causing them to be easily noticeable by human examiners and insufficiently stealthy against automatic patch defenses. In this paper, we introduce IAP, a novel attack framework that generates highly invisible adversarial patches based on perceptibility-aware localization and perturbation optimization schemes. Specifically, IAP first searches for a proper location to place the patch by leveraging classwise localization and sensitivity maps, balancing the susceptibility of patch location to both victim model prediction and human visual system, then employs a perceptibility-regularized adversarial loss and a gradient update rule that prioritizes color constancy for optimizing invisible perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across various image benchmarks and model architectures demonstrate that IAP consistently achieves competitive attack success rates in targeted settings with significantly improved patch invisibility compared to existing baselines. In addition to being highly imperceptible to humans, IAP is shown to be stealthy enough to render several state-of-the-art patch defenses ineffective.

Abstract: Public product launches in Artificial Intelligence can serve as focusing events for collective attention, surfacing how societies react to technological change. Social media provide a window into the sensemaking around these events, surfacing hopes and fears and showing who chooses to engage in the discourse and when. We demonstrate that public sensemaking about AI is shaped by economic interests and cultural values of those involved. We analyze 3.8 million tweets posted by 1.6 million users across 117 countries in response to the public launch of ChatGPT in 2022. Our analysis shows how economic self-interest, proxied by occupational skill types in writing, programming, and mathematics, and national cultural orientations, as measured by Hofstede's individualism, uncertainty avoidance, and power distance dimensions, shape who speaks, when they speak, and their stance towards ChatGPT. Roles requiring more technical skills, such as programming and mathematics, tend to engage earlier and express more positive stances, whereas writing-centric occupations join later with greater skepticism. At the cultural level, individualism predicts both earlier engagement and a more negative stance, and uncertainty avoidance reduces the prevalence of positive stances but does not delay when users first engage with ChatGPT. Aggregate sentiment trends mask the dynamics observed in our study. The shift toward a more critical stance towards ChatGPT over time stems primarily from the entry of more skeptical voices rather than a change of heart among early adopters. Our findings underscore the importance of both the occupational background and cultural context in understanding public reactions to AI.

<title>A Single-Point Measurement Framework for Robust Cyber-Attack Diagnosis in Smart Microgrids Using Dual Fractional-Order Feature Analysis</title>

Abstract: Cyber-attacks jeopardize the safe operation of smart microgrids. At the same time, existing diagnostic methods either depend on expensive multi-point instrumentation or stringent modelling assumptions that are untenable under single-sensor constraints. This paper proposes a Fractional-Order Memory-Enhanced Attack-Diagnosis Scheme (FO-MADS) that achieves low-latency fault localisation and cyber-attack detection using only one VPQ (Voltage-Power-Reactive-power) sensor. FO-MADS first constructs a dual fractional-order feature library by jointly applying Caputo and Gr\"unwald-Letnikov derivatives, thereby amplifying micro-perturbations and slow drifts in the VPQ signal. A two-stage hierarchical classifier then pinpoints the affected inverter and isolates the faulty IGBT switch, effectively alleviating class imbalance. Robustness is further strengthened through Progressive Memory-Replay Adversarial Training (PMR-AT), whose attack-aware loss is dynamically re-weighted via Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM) to prioritise the most challenging samples. Experiments on a four-inverter microgrid testbed comprising 1 normal and 24 fault classes under four attack scenarios demonstrate diagnostic accuracies of 96.6 % (bias), 94.0 % (noise), 92.8 % (data replacement), and 95.7 % (replay), while sustaining 96.7 % under attack-free conditions. These results establish FO-MADS as a cost-effective and readily deployable solution that markedly enhances the cyber-physical resilience of smart microgrids.

<title>Squeeze the Soaked Sponge: Efficient Off-policy Reinforcement Finetuning for Large Language Model</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06892</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.06892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its potential to improve the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). One major limitation of most existing Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) methods is that they are on-policy RL in nature, i.e., data generated during the past learning process is not fully utilized. This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time, posing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling. To this end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating Mix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable on-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data. ReMix consists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient with an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2) KL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and flexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from efficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement. In our experiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base models. ReMix shows an average Pass@1 accuracy of 52.10% (for 1.5B model) with 0.079M response rollouts, 350 training steps and achieves 63.27%/64.39% (for 7B model) with 0.007M/0.011M response rollouts, 50/75 training steps, on five math reasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME'24, AMC'23, Minerva, OlympiadBench, and MATH500). Compared with 15 recent advanced models, ReMix shows SOTA-level performance with an over 30x to 450x reduction in training cost in terms of rollout data volume. In addition, we reveal insightful findings via multifaceted analysis, including the implicit preference for shorter responses due to the Whipping Effect of off-policy discrepancy, the collapse mode of self-reflection behavior under the presence of severe off-policyness, etc.

Abstract: The growing demand for efficient knowledge graph (KG) enrichment leveraging external corpora has intensified interest in relation extraction (RE), particularly under low-supervision settings. To address the need for adaptable and noise-resilient RE solutions that integrate seamlessly with pre-trained large language models (PLMs), we introduce SCoRE, a modular and cost-effective sentence-level RE system. SCoRE enables easy PLM switching, requires no finetuning, and adapts smoothly to diverse corpora and KGs. By combining supervised contrastive learning with a Bayesian k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) classifier for multi-label classification, it delivers robust performance despite the noisy annotations of distantly supervised corpora. To improve RE evaluation, we propose two novel metrics: Correlation Structure Distance (CSD), measuring the alignment between learned relational patterns and KG structures, and Precision at R (P@R), assessing utility as a recommender system. We also release Wiki20d, a benchmark dataset replicating real-world RE conditions where only KG-derived annotations are available. Experiments on five benchmarks show that SCoRE matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing energy consumption. Further analyses reveal that increasing model complexity, as seen in prior work, degrades performance, highlighting the advantages of SCoRE's minimal design. Combining efficiency, modularity, and scalability, SCoRE stands as an optimal choice for real-world RE applications.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have emerged as a revolutionary approach to automating human-machine interactions, capable of autonomously operating personal devices (e.g., mobile phones) or applications within the device to perform complex real-world tasks in a human-like manner. However, their close integration with personal devices raises significant security concerns, with many threats, including backdoor attacks, remaining largely unexplored. This work reveals that the visual grounding of GUI agent-mapping textual plans to GUI elements-can introduce vulnerabilities, enabling new types of backdoor attacks. With backdoor attack targeting visual grounding, the agent's behavior can be compromised even when given correct task-solving plans. To validate this vulnerability, we propose VisualTrap, a method that can hijack the grounding by misleading the agent to locate textual plans to trigger locations instead of the intended targets. VisualTrap uses the common method of injecting poisoned data for attacks, and does so during the pre-training of visual grounding to ensure practical feasibility of attacking. Empirical results show that VisualTrap can effectively hijack visual grounding with as little as 5% poisoned data and highly stealthy visual triggers (invisible to the human eye); and the attack can be generalized to downstream tasks, even after clean fine-tuning. Moreover, the injected trigger can remain effective across different GUI environments, e.g., being trained on mobile/web and generalizing to desktop environments. These findings underscore the urgent need for further research on backdoor attack risks in GUI agents.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of memes on social media has highlighted the urgent need for effective approaches to detect harmful content. However, traditional data-driven approaches struggle to detect new memes due to their evolving nature and the lack of up-to-date annotated data. To address this issue, we propose MIND, a multi-agent framework for zero-shot harmful meme detection that does not rely on annotated data. MIND implements three key strategies: 1) We retrieve similar memes from an unannotated reference set to provide contextual information. 2) We propose a bi-directional insight derivation mechanism to extract a comprehensive understanding of similar memes. 3) We then employ a multi-agent debate mechanism to ensure robust decision-making through reasoned arbitration. Extensive experiments on three meme datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework not only outperforms existing zero-shot approaches but also shows strong generalization across different model architectures and parameter scales, providing a scalable solution for harmful meme detection. The code is available at https://github.com/destroy-lonely/MIND.

Abstract: Legal judgment prediction offers a compelling method to aid legal practitioners and researchers. However, the research question remains relatively under-explored: Should multiple defendants and charges be treated separately in LJP? To address this, we introduce a new dataset namely multi-person multi-charge prediction (MPMCP), and seek the answer by evaluating the performance of several prevailing legal large language models (LLMs) on four practical legal judgment scenarios: (S1) single defendant with a single charge, (S2) single defendant with multiple charges, (S3) multiple defendants with a single charge, and (S4) multiple defendants with multiple charges. We evaluate the dataset across two LJP tasks, i.e., charge prediction and penalty term prediction. We have conducted extensive experiments and found that the scenario involving multiple defendants and multiple charges (S4) poses the greatest challenges, followed by S2, S3, and S1. The impact varies significantly depending on the model. For example, in S4 compared to S1, InternLM2 achieves approximately 4.5% lower F1-score and 2.8% higher LogD, while Lawformer demonstrates around 19.7% lower F1-score and 19.0% higher LogD. Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/lololo-xiao/MultiJustice-MPMCP.

Abstract: The proliferation of data-intensive Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications at the network edge demands a fundamental shift in RAN design, from merely consuming AI for network optimization, to actively enabling distributed AI workloads. This paradigm shift presents a significant opportunity for network operators to monetize AI at the edge while leveraging existing infrastructure investments. To realize this vision, this article presents a novel converged O-RAN and AI-RAN architecture that unifies orchestration and management of both telecommunications and AI workloads on shared infrastructure. The proposed architecture extends the Open RAN principles of modularity, disaggregation, and cloud-nativeness to support heterogeneous AI deployments. We introduce two key architectural innovations: (i) the AI-RAN Orchestrator, which extends the O-RAN Service Management and Orchestration (SMO) to enable integrated resource and allocation across RAN and AI workloads; and (ii) AI-RAN sites that provide distributed edge AI platforms with real-time processing capabilities. The proposed system supports flexible deployment options, allowing AI workloads to be orchestrated with specific timing requirements (real-time or batch processing) and geographic targeting. The proposed architecture addresses the orchestration requirements for managing heterogeneous workloads at different time scales while maintaining open, standardized interfaces and multi-vendor interoperability.

<title>What Has a Foundation Model Found? Using Inductive Bias to Probe for World Models</title>

Abstract: Foundation models are premised on the idea that sequence prediction can uncover deeper domain understanding, much like how Kepler's predictions of planetary motion later led to the discovery of Newtonian mechanics. However, evaluating whether these models truly capture deeper structure remains a challenge. We develop a technique for evaluating foundation models that examines how they adapt to synthetic datasets generated from some postulated world model. Our technique measures whether the foundation model's inductive bias aligns with the world model, and so we refer to it as an inductive bias probe. Across multiple domains, we find that foundation models can excel at their training tasks yet fail to develop inductive biases towards the underlying world model when adapted to new tasks. We particularly find that foundation models trained on orbital trajectories consistently fail to apply Newtonian mechanics when adapted to new physics tasks. Further analysis reveals that these models behave as if they develop task-specific heuristics that fail to generalize.

<title>CheXPO: Preference Optimization for Chest X-ray VLMs with Counterfactual Rationale</title>

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are prone to hallucinations that critically compromise reliability in medical applications. While preference optimization can mitigate these hallucinations through clinical feedback, its implementation faces challenges such as clinically irrelevant training samples, imbalanced data distributions, and prohibitive expert annotation costs. To address these challenges, we introduce CheXPO, a Chest X-ray Preference Optimization strategy that combines confidence-similarity joint mining with counterfactual rationale. Our approach begins by synthesizing a unified, fine-grained multi-task chest X-ray visual instruction dataset across different question types for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We then identify hard examples through token-level confidence analysis of SFT failures and use similarity-based retrieval to expand hard examples for balancing preference sample distributions, while synthetic counterfactual rationales provide fine-grained clinical preferences, eliminating the need for additional expert input. Experiments show that CheXPO achieves 8.93% relative performance gain using only 5% of SFT samples, reaching state-of-the-art performance across diverse clinical tasks and providing a scalable, interpretable solution for real-world radiology applications.

<title>Noisy PDE Training Requires Bigger PINNs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06967</link>

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are increasingly used to approximate solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs), especially in high dimensions. In real-world applications, data samples are noisy, so it is important to know when a predictor can still achieve low empirical risk. However, little is known about the conditions under which a PINN can do so effectively. We prove a lower bound on the size of neural networks required for the supervised PINN empirical risk to fall below the variance of noisy supervision labels. Specifically, if a predictor achieves an empirical risk $O(\eta)$ below $\sigma^2$ (variance of supervision data), then necessarily $d_N\log d_N\gtrsim N_s \eta^2$, where $N_s$ is the number of samples and $d_N$ is the number of trainable parameters of the PINN. A similar constraint applies to the fully unsupervised PINN setting when boundary labels are sampled noisily. Consequently, increasing the number of noisy supervision labels alone does not provide a ``free lunch'' in reducing empirical risk. We also show empirically that PINNs can indeed achieve empirical risks below $\sigma^2$ under such conditions. As a case study, we investigate PINNs applied to the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) PDE. Our findings lay the groundwork for quantitatively understanding the parameter requirements for training PINNs in the presence of noise.

<title>Unifying Re-Identification, Attribute Inference, and Data Reconstruction Risks in Differential Privacy</title>

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) mechanisms are difficult to interpret and calibrate because existing methods for mapping standard privacy parameters to concrete privacy risks -- re-identification, attribute inference, and data reconstruction -- are both overly pessimistic and inconsistent. In this work, we use the hypothesis-testing interpretation of DP ($f$-DP), and determine that bounds on attack success can take the same unified form across re-identification, attribute inference, and data reconstruction risks. Our unified bounds are (1) consistent across a multitude of attack settings, and (2) tunable, enabling practitioners to evaluate risk with respect to arbitrary (including worst-case) levels of baseline risk. Empirically, our results are tighter than prior methods using $\varepsilon$-DP, R\'enyi DP, and concentrated DP. As a result, calibrating noise using our bounds can reduce the required noise by 20% at the same risk level, which yields, e.g., more than 15pp accuracy increase in a text classification task. Overall, this unifying perspective provides a principled framework for interpreting and calibrating the degree of protection in DP against specific levels of re-identification, attribute inference, or data reconstruction risk.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for radiology report generation (RRG), clinical adoption remains challenging due to difficulties in accurately mapping pathological and anatomical features to their corresponding text descriptions. Additionally, semantic agnostic feature extraction further hampers the generation of accurate diagnostic reports. To address these challenges, we introduce Medical Concept Aligned Radiology Report Generation (MCA-RG), a knowledge-driven framework that explicitly aligns visual features with distinct medical concepts to enhance the report generation process. MCA-RG utilizes two curated concept banks: a pathology bank containing lesion-related knowledge, and an anatomy bank with anatomical descriptions. The visual features are aligned with these medical concepts and undergo tailored enhancement. We further propose an anatomy-based contrastive learning procedure to improve the generalization of anatomical features, coupled with a matching loss for pathological features to prioritize clinically relevant regions. Additionally, a feature gating mechanism is employed to filter out low-quality concept features. Finally, the visual features are corresponding to individual medical concepts, and are leveraged to guide the report generation process. Experiments on two public benchmarks (MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus) demonstrate that MCA-RG achieves superior performance, highlighting its effectiveness in radiology report generation.

Abstract: Accurate prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients undergoing immunotherapy is essential for personalized treatment planning, enabling informed patient decisions, and improving both treatment outcomes and quality of life. However, the lack of large, relevant datasets and effective multi-modal feature fusion strategies pose significant challenges in this domain. To address these challenges, we present a large-scale dataset and introduce a novel framework for multi-modal feature fusion aimed at enhancing the accuracy of survival prediction. The dataset comprises 3D CT images and corresponding clinical records from NSCLC patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), along with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) data. We further propose a cross-modality masked learning approach for medical feature fusion, consisting of two distinct branches, each tailored to its respective modality: a Slice-Depth Transformer for extracting 3D features from CT images and a graph-based Transformer for learning node features and relationships among clinical variables in tabular data. The fusion process is guided by a masked modality learning strategy, wherein the model utilizes the intact modality to reconstruct missing components. This mechanism improves the integration of modality-specific features, fostering more effective inter-modality relationships and feature interactions. Our approach demonstrates superior performance in multi-modal integration for NSCLC survival prediction, surpassing existing methods and setting a new benchmark for prognostic models in this context.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) are time-series relational databases that record patient interactions and medical events over time, serving as a critical resource for healthcare research and applications. However, privacy concerns and regulatory restrictions limit the sharing and utilization of such sensitive data, necessitating the generation of synthetic EHR datasets. Unlike previous EHR synthesis methods, which typically generate medical records consisting of expert-chosen features (e.g. a few vital signs or structured codes only), we introduce RawMed, the first framework to synthesize multi-table, time-series EHR data that closely resembles raw EHRs. Using text-based representation and compression techniques, RawMed captures complex structures and temporal dynamics with minimal preprocessing. We also propose a new evaluation framework for multi-table time-series synthetic EHRs, assessing distributional similarity, inter-table relationships, temporal dynamics, and privacy. Validated on two open-source EHR datasets, RawMed outperforms baseline models in fidelity and utility. The code is available at https://github.com/eunbyeol-cho/RawMed.

Abstract: We introduce FlexOlmo, a new class of language models (LMs) that supports (1) distributed training without data sharing, where different model parameters are independently trained on closed datasets, and (2) data-flexible inference, where these parameters along with their associated data can be flexibly included or excluded from model inferences with no further training. FlexOlmo employs a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture where each expert is trained independently on closed datasets and later integrated through a new domain-informed routing without any joint training. FlexOlmo is trained on FlexMix, a corpus we curate comprising publicly available datasets alongside seven domain-specific sets, representing realistic approximations of closed sets. We evaluate models with up to 37 billion parameters (20 billion active) on 31 diverse downstream tasks. We show that a general expert trained on public data can be effectively combined with independently trained experts from other data owners, leading to an average 41% relative improvement while allowing users to opt out of certain data based on data licensing or permission requirements. Our approach also outperforms prior model merging methods by 10.1% on average and surpasses the standard MoE trained without data restrictions using the same training FLOPs. Altogether, this research presents a solution for both data owners and researchers in regulated industries with sensitive or protected data. FlexOlmo enables benefiting from closed data while respecting data owners' preferences by keeping their data local and supporting fine-grained control of data access during inference.

<title>PLAME: Leveraging Pretrained Language Models to Generate Enhanced Protein Multiple Sequence Alignments</title>

Abstract: Protein structure prediction is essential for drug discovery and understanding biological functions. While recent advancements like AlphaFold have achieved remarkable accuracy, most folding models rely heavily on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) to boost prediction performance. This dependency limits their effectiveness on low-homology proteins and orphan proteins, where MSA information is sparse or unavailable. To address this limitation, we propose PLAME, a novel MSA design model that leverages evolutionary embeddings from pretrained protein language models. Unlike existing methods, PLAME introduces pretrained representations to enhance evolutionary information and employs a conservation-diversity loss to enhance generation quality. Additionally, we propose a novel MSA selection method to effectively screen high-quality MSAs and improve folding performance. We also propose a sequence quality assessment metric that provides an orthogonal perspective to evaluate MSA quality. On the AlphaFold2 benchmark of low-homology and orphan proteins, PLAME achieves state-of-the-art performance in folding enhancement and sequence quality assessment, with consistent improvements demonstrated on AlphaFold3. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the MSA selection method, while extensive case studies on various protein types provide insights into the relationship between AlphaFold's prediction quality and MSA characteristics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PLAME can serve as an adapter achieving AlphaFold2-level accuracy with the ESMFold's inference speed.

Abstract: This study presents a surrogate model designed to predict the Nusselt number distribution in an enclosed impinging jet arrays, where each jet function independently and where jets can be transformed from inlets to outlets, leading to a vast number of possible flow arrangements. While computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations can model heat transfer with high fidelity, their cost prohibits real-time application such as model-based temperature control. To address this, we generate a CNN-based surrogate model that can predict the Nusselt distribution in real time. We train it with data from implicit large eddy computational fluid dynamics simulations (Re < 2,000). We train two distinct models, one for a five by one array of jets (83 simulations) and one for a three by three array of jets (100 simulations). We introduce a method to extrapolate predictions to higher Reynolds numbers (Re < 10,000) using a correlation-based scaling. The surrogate models achieve high accuracy, with a normalized mean average error below 2% on validation data for the five by one surrogate model and 0.6% for the three by three surrogate model. Experimental validation confirms the model's predictive capabilities. This work provides a foundation for model-based control strategies in advanced thermal management applications.

<title>Modeling Heterogeneity across Varying Spatial Extents: Discovering Linkages between Sea Ice Retreat and Ice Shelve Melt in the Antarctic</title>

Abstract: Spatial phenomena often exhibit heterogeneity across spatial extents and in proximity, making them complex to model-especially in dynamic regions like ice shelves and sea ice. In this study, we address this challenge by exploring the linkages between sea ice retreat and Antarctic ice shelf (AIS) melt. Although atmospheric forcing and basal melting have been widely studied, the direct impact of sea ice retreat on AIS mass loss remains underexplored. Traditional models treat sea ice and AIS as separate systems. It limits their ability to capture localized linkages and cascading feedback. To overcome this, we propose Spatial-Link, a novel graph-based framework that quantifies spatial heterogeneity to capture linkages between sea ice retreat and AIS melt. Our method constructs a spatial graph using Delaunay triangulation of satellite-derived ice change matrices, where nodes represent regions of significant change and edges encode proximity and directional consistency. We extract and statistically validate linkage paths using breadth-first search and Monte Carlo simulations. Results reveal non-local, spatially heterogeneous coupling patterns, suggesting sea ice loss can initiate or amplify downstream AIS melt. Our analysis shows how sea ice retreat evolves over an oceanic grid and progresses toward ice shelves-establishing a direct linkage. To our knowledge, this is the first proposed methodology linking sea ice retreat to AIS melt. Spatial-Link offers a scalable, data-driven tool to improve sea-level rise projections and inform climate adaptation strategies.

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence into hearing assistance marks a paradigm shift from traditional amplification-based systems to intelligent, context-aware audio processing. This systematic literature review evaluates advances in AI-driven selective noise cancellation (SNC) for hearing aids, highlighting technological evolution, implementation challenges, and future research directions. We synthesize findings across deep learning architectures, hardware deployment strategies, clinical validation studies, and user-centric design. The review traces progress from early machine learning models to state-of-the-art deep networks, including Convolutional Recurrent Networks for real-time inference and Transformer-based architectures for high-accuracy separation. Key findings include significant gains over traditional methods, with recent models achieving up to 18.3 dB SI-SDR improvement on noisy-reverberant benchmarks, alongside sub-10 ms real-time implementations and promising clinical outcomes. Yet, challenges remain in bridging lab-grade models with real-world deployment - particularly around power constraints, environmental variability, and personalization. Identified research gaps include hardware-software co-design, standardized evaluation protocols, and regulatory considerations for AI-enhanced hearing devices. Future work must prioritize lightweight models, continual learning, contextual-based classification and clinical translation to realize transformative hearing solutions for millions globally.

Abstract: Nowadays, speech emotion recognition (SER) plays a vital role in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI) and the evolution of artificial intelligence (AI). Our proposed DCRF-BiLSTM model is used to recognize seven emotions: neutral, happy, sad, angry, fear, disgust, and surprise, which are trained on five datasets: RAVDESS (R), TESS (T), SAVEE (S), EmoDB (E), and Crema-D (C). The model achieves high accuracy on individual datasets, including 97.83% on RAVDESS, 97.02% on SAVEE, 95.10% for CREMA-D, and a perfect 100% on both TESS and EMO-DB. For the combined (R+T+S) datasets, it achieves 98.82% accuracy, outperforming previously reported results. To our knowledge, no existing study has evaluated a single SER model across all five benchmark datasets (i.e., R+T+S+C+E) simultaneously. In our work, we introduce this comprehensive combination and achieve a remarkable overall accuracy of 93.76%. These results confirm the robustness and generalizability of our DCRF-BiLSTM framework across diverse datasets.

Abstract: The automated classification of phonocardiogram (PCG) recordings represents a substantial advancement in cardiovascular diagnostics. This paper presents a systematic comparison of four distinct models for heart murmur detection: two specialized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and two zero-shot universal audio transformers (BEATs), evaluated using fixed-length and heart cycle normalization approaches. Utilizing the PhysioNet2022 dataset, a custom heart cycle normalization method tailored to individual cardiac rhythms is introduced. The findings indicate the following AUROC values: the CNN model with fixed-length windowing achieves 79.5%, the CNN model with heart cycle normalization scores 75.4%, the BEATs transformer with fixed-length windowing achieves 65.7%, and the BEATs transformer with heart cycle normalization results in 70.1%.
  The findings indicate that physiological signal constraints, especially those introduced by different normalization strategies, have a substantial impact on model performance. The research provides evidence-based guidelines for architecture selection in clinical settings, emphasizing the need for a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. Although specialized CNNs demonstrate superior performance overall, the zero-shot transformer models may offer promising efficiency advantages during development, such as faster training and evaluation cycles, despite their lower classification accuracy. These findings highlight the potential of automated classification systems to enhance cardiac diagnostics and improve patient care.

Abstract: Retrosynthesis, the identification of precursor molecules for a target compound, is pivotal for synthesizing complex molecules, but faces challenges in discovering novel pathways beyond predefined templates. Recent large language model (LLM) approaches to retrosynthesis have shown promise but effectively harnessing LLM reasoning capabilities for effective multi-step planning remains an open question. To address this challenge, we introduce DeepRetro, an open-source, iterative, hybrid LLM-based retrosynthetic framework. Our approach integrates the strengths of conventional template-based/Monte Carlo tree search tools with the generative power of LLMs in a step-wise, feedback-driven loop. Initially, synthesis planning is attempted with a template-based engine. If this fails, the LLM subsequently proposes single-step retrosynthetic disconnections. Crucially, these suggestions undergo rigorous validity, stability, and hallucination checks before the resulting precursors are recursively fed back into the pipeline for further evaluation. This iterative refinement allows for dynamic pathway exploration and correction. We demonstrate the potential of this pipeline through benchmark evaluations and case studies, showcasing its ability to identify viable and potentially novel retrosynthetic routes. In particular, we develop an interactive graphical user interface that allows expert human chemists to provide human-in-the-loop feedback to the reasoning algorithm. This approach successfully generates novel pathways for complex natural product compounds, demonstrating the potential for iterative LLM reasoning to advance state-of-art in complex chemical syntheses.

Abstract: Acoustic mapping techniques have long been used in spatial audio processing for direction of arrival estimation (DoAE). Traditional beamforming methods for acoustic mapping, while interpretable, often rely on iterative solvers that can be computationally intensive and sensitive to acoustic variability. On the other hand, recent supervised deep learning approaches offer feedforward speed and robustness but require large labeled datasets and lack interpretability. Despite their strengths, both methods struggle to consistently generalize across diverse acoustic setups and array configurations, limiting their broader applicability. We introduce the Latent Acoustic Mapping (LAM) model, a self-supervised framework that bridges the interpretability of traditional methods with the adaptability and efficiency of deep learning methods. LAM generates high-resolution acoustic maps, adapts to varying acoustic conditions, and operates efficiently across different microphone arrays. We assess its robustness on DoAE using the LOCATA and STARSS benchmarks. LAM achieves comparable or superior localization performance to existing supervised methods. Additionally, we show that LAM's acoustic maps can serve as effective features for supervised models, further enhancing DoAE accuracy and underscoring its potential to advance adaptive, high-performance sound localization systems.

Abstract: The spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami (LB) operator is central in geometric deep learning tasks, capturing intrinsic properties of the shape of the object under consideration. The best established method for its estimation, from a triangulated mesh of the object, is based on the Finite Element Method (FEM), and computes the top k LB eigenvalues with a complexity of O(Nk), where N is the number of points. This can render the FEM method inefficient when repeatedly applied to databases of CAD mechanical parts, or in quality control applications where part metrology is acquired as large meshes and decisions about the quality of each part are needed quickly and frequently. As a solution to this problem, we present a geometric deep learning framework to predict the LB spectrum efficiently given the CAD mesh of a part, achieving significant computational savings without sacrificing accuracy, demonstrating that the LB spectrum is learnable. The proposed Graph Neural Network architecture uses a rich set of part mesh features - including Gaussian curvature, mean curvature, and principal curvatures. In addition to our trained network, we make available, for repeatability, a large curated dataset of real-world mechanical CAD models derived from the publicly available ABC dataset used for training and testing. Experimental results show that our method reduces computation time of the LB spectrum by approximately 5 times over linear FEM while delivering competitive accuracy.

Abstract: Event prediction is the ability of anticipating future events, i.e., future real-world occurrences, and aims to support the user in deciding on actions that change future events towards a desired state. An event prediction method learns the relation between features of past events and future events. It is applied to newly observed events to predict corresponding future events that are evaluated with respect to the user's desired future state. If the predicted future events do not comply with this state, actions are taken towards achieving desirable future states. Evidently, event prediction is valuable in many application domains such as business and natural disasters. The diversity of application domains results in a diverse range of methods that are scattered across various research areas which, in turn, use different terminology for event prediction methods. Consequently, sharing methods and knowledge for developing future event prediction methods is restricted. To facilitate knowledge sharing on account of a comprehensive integration and assessment of event prediction methods, we take a systems perspective to integrate event prediction methods into a single system, elicit requirements, and assess existing work with respect to the requirements. Based on the assessment, we identify open challenges and discuss future research directions.

Abstract: Relational concept analysis (RCA) is an extension of formal concept analysis allowing to deal with several related contexts simultaneously. It has been designed for learning description logic theories from data and used within various applications. A puzzling observation about RCA is that it returns a single family of concept lattices although, when the data feature circular dependencies, other solutions may be considered acceptable. The semantics of RCA, provided in an operational way, does not shed light on this issue. In this report, we define these acceptable solutions as those families of concept lattices which belong to the space determined by the initial contexts (well-formed), cannot scale new attributes (saturated), and refer only to concepts of the family (self-supported). We adopt a functional view on the RCA process by defining the space of well-formed solutions and two functions on that space: one expansive and the other contractive. We show that the acceptable solutions are the common fixed points of both functions. This is achieved step-by-step by starting from a minimal version of RCA that considers only one single context defined on a space of contexts and a space of lattices. These spaces are then joined into a single space of context-lattice pairs, which is further extended to a space of indexed families of context-lattice pairs representing the objects manippulated by RCA. We show that RCA returns the least element of the set of acceptable solutions. In addition, it is possible to build dually an operation that generates its greatest element. The set of acceptable solutions is a complete sublattice of the interval between these two elements. Its structure and how the defined functions traverse it are studied in detail.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) significantly improve the alignment of human-AI values and further raise the upper bound of AI capabilities, particularly in reasoning-intensive, long-context Chain-of-Thought (long-CoT) tasks. However, existing RLHF (or RLVR) frameworks commonly face challenges such as inference bottlenecks and complexity barriers, restricting their accessibility for newcomers. To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenRLHF, a user-friendly, scalable, and easy-to-learn open-source RLHF framework built upon Ray, vLLM, DeepSpeed, and HuggingFace Transformers, featuring a simplified design, clear code structure, and comprehensive documentation to facilitate entry for researchers and practitioners. Experimental results show that OpenRLHF achieves superior training efficiency with speedups ranging from 1.22x to 1.68x across different model sizes compared to state-of-the-art frameworks, while requiring significantly fewer lines of code for implementation. OpenRLHF is publicly available at https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF, and has already been adopted by leading institutions to accelerate RLHF research and learning.

<title>Planning Anything with Rigor: General-Purpose Zero-Shot Planning with LLM-based Formalized Programming</title>

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong potential in solving planning problems, there is a trade-off between flexibility and complexity. LLMs, as zero-shot planners themselves, are still not capable of directly generating valid plans for complex planning problems such as multi-constraint or long-horizon tasks. On the other hand, many frameworks aiming to solve complex planning problems often rely on task-specific preparatory efforts, such as task-specific in-context examples and pre-defined critics/verifiers, which limits their cross-task generalization capability. In this paper, we tackle these challenges by observing that the core of many planning problems lies in optimization problems: searching for the optimal solution (best plan) with goals subject to constraints (preconditions and effects of decisions). With LLMs' commonsense, reasoning, and programming capabilities, this opens up the possibilities of a universal LLM-based approach to planning problems. Inspired by this observation, we propose LLMFP, a general-purpose framework that leverages LLMs to capture key information from planning problems and formally formulate and solve them as optimization problems from scratch, with no task-specific examples needed. We apply LLMFP to 9 planning problems, ranging from multi-constraint decision making to multi-step planning problems, and demonstrate that LLMFP achieves on average 83.7% and 86.8% optimal rate across 9 tasks for GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, significantly outperforming the best baseline (direct planning with OpenAI o1-preview) with 37.6% and 40.7% improvements. We also validate components of LLMFP with ablation experiments and analyzed the underlying success and failure reasons. Project page: https://sites.google.com/view/llmfp.

<title>Can adversarial attacks by large language models be attributed?</title>

Abstract: Attributing outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) in adversarial settings-such as cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns-presents significant challenges that are likely to grow in importance. We approach this attribution problem from both a theoretical and an empirical perspective, drawing on formal language theory (identification in the limit) and data-driven analysis of the expanding LLM ecosystem. By modeling an LLM's set of possible outputs as a formal language, we analyze whether finite samples of text can uniquely pinpoint the originating model. Our results show that, under mild assumptions of overlapping capabilities among models, certain classes of LLMs are fundamentally non-identifiable from their outputs alone. We delineate four regimes of theoretical identifiability: (1) an infinite class of deterministic (discrete) LLM languages is not identifiable (Gold's classical result from 1967); (2) an infinite class of probabilistic LLMs is also not identifiable (by extension of the deterministic case); (3) a finite class of deterministic LLMs is identifiable (consistent with Angluin's tell-tale criterion); and (4) even a finite class of probabilistic LLMs can be non-identifiable (we provide a new counterexample establishing this negative result). Complementing these theoretical insights, we quantify the explosion in the number of plausible model origins (hypothesis space) for a given output in recent years. Even under conservative assumptions-each open-source model fine-tuned on at most one new dataset-the count of distinct candidate models doubles approximately every 0.5 years, and allowing multi-dataset fine-tuning combinations yields doubling times as short as 0.28 years. This combinatorial growth, alongside the extraordinary computational cost of brute-force likelihood attribution across all models and potential users, renders exhaustive attribution infeasible in practice.

<title>Multi-Agent Pathfinding Under Team-Connected Communication Constraint via Adaptive Path Expansion and Dynamic Leading</title>

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel planning framework to handle a multi-agent pathfinding problem under team-connected communication constraint, where all agents must have a connected communication channel to the rest of the team during their entire movements. Standard multi-agent path finding approaches (e.g., priority-based search) have potential in this domain but fail when neighboring configurations at start and goal differ. Their single-expansion approach -- computing each agent's path from the start to the goal in just a single expansion -- cannot reliably handle planning under communication constraints for agents as their neighbors change during navigating. Similarly, leader-follower approaches (e.g., platooning) are effective at maintaining team communication, but fixing the leader at the outset of planning can cause planning to become stuck in dense-clutter environments, limiting their practical utility. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel two-level multi-agent pathfinding framework that integrates two techniques: adaptive path expansion to expand agent paths to their goals in multiple stages; and dynamic leading technique that enables the reselection of the leading agent during each agent path expansion whenever progress cannot be made. Simulation experiments show the efficiency of our planners, which can handle up to 25 agents across five environment types under a limited communication range constraint and up to 11-12 agents on three environment types under line-of-sight communication constraint, exceeding 90% success-rate where baselines routinely fail.

Abstract: Current financial large language models (FinLLMs) struggle with two critical limitations: the absence of objective evaluation metrics to assess the quality of stock analysis reports and a lack of depth in stock analysis, which impedes their ability to generate professional-grade insights. To address these challenges, this paper introduces FinSphere, a stock analysis agent, along with three major contributions: (1) AnalyScore, a systematic evaluation framework for assessing stock analysis quality, (2) Stocksis, a dataset curated by industry experts to enhance LLMs' stock analysis capabilities, and (3) FinSphere, an AI agent that can generate high-quality stock analysis reports in response to user queries. Experiments demonstrate that FinSphere achieves superior performance compared to both general and domain-specific LLMs, as well as existing agent-based systems, even when they are enhanced with real-time data access and few-shot guidance. The integrated framework, which combines real-time data feeds, quantitative tools, and an instruction-tuned LLM, yields substantial improvements in both analytical quality and practical applicability for real-world stock analysis.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) focuses on determining conflict-free paths for multiple agents navigating through a shared space to reach specified goal locations. This problem becomes computationally challenging, particularly when handling large numbers of agents, as frequently encountered in practical applications like coordinating autonomous vehicles. Quantum Computing (QC) is a promising candidate in overcoming such limits. However, current quantum hardware is still in its infancy and thus limited in terms of computing power and error robustness. In this work, we present the first optimal hybrid quantum-classical MAPF algorithms which are based on branch-andcut-and-price. QC is integrated by iteratively solving QUBO problems, based on conflict graphs. Experiments on actual quantum hardware and results on benchmark data suggest that our approach dominates previous QUBO formulationsand state-of-the-art MAPF solvers.

Abstract: We aim to develop a goal specification method that is semantically clear, spatially sensitive, domain-agnostic, and intuitive for human users to guide agent interactions in 3D environments. Specifically, we propose a novel cross-view goal alignment framework that allows users to specify target objects using segmentation masks from their camera views rather than the agent's observations. We highlight that behavior cloning alone fails to align the agent's behavior with human intent when the human and agent camera views differ significantly. To address this, we introduce two auxiliary objectives: cross-view consistency loss and target visibility loss, which explicitly enhance the agent's spatial reasoning ability. According to this, we develop ROCKET-2, a state-of-the-art agent trained in Minecraft, achieving an improvement in the efficiency of inference 3x to 6x compared to ROCKET-1. We show that ROCKET-2 can directly interpret goals from human camera views, enabling better human-agent interaction. Remarkably, ROCKET-2 demonstrates zero-shot generalization capabilities: despite being trained exclusively on the Minecraft dataset, it can adapt and generalize to other 3D environments like Doom, DMLab, and Unreal through a simple action space mapping.

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning with large language models (RLLMs), such as OpenAI-O1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated their impressive capabilities in complex domains like mathematics and coding. A central factor in their success lies in the application of long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) characteristics, which enhance reasoning abilities and enable the solution of intricate problems. However, despite these developments, a comprehensive survey on Long CoT is still lacking, limiting our understanding of its distinctions from traditional short chain-of-thought (Short CoT) and complicating ongoing debates on issues like "overthinking" and "inference-time scaling." This survey seeks to fill this gap by offering a unified perspective on Long CoT. (1) We first distinguish Long CoT from Short CoT and introduce a novel taxonomy to categorize current reasoning paradigms. (2) Next, we explore the key characteristics of Long CoT: deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and feasible reflection, which enable models to handle more complex tasks and produce more efficient, coherent outcomes compared to the shallower Short CoT. (3) We then investigate key phenomena such as the emergence of Long CoT with these characteristics, including overthinking, and inference-time scaling, offering insights into how these processes manifest in practice. (4) Finally, we identify significant research gaps and highlight promising future directions, including the integration of multi-modal reasoning, efficiency improvements, and enhanced knowledge frameworks. By providing a structured overview, this survey aims to inspire future research and further the development of logical reasoning in artificial intelligence.

Abstract: This paper introduces SagaLLM, a structured multi-agent architecture designed to address four foundational limitations of current LLM-based planning systems: unreliable self-validation, context loss, lack of transactional safeguards, and insufficient inter-agent coordination. While recent frameworks leverage LLMs for task decomposition and multi-agent communication, they often fail to ensure consistency, rollback, or constraint satisfaction across distributed workflows. SagaLLM bridges this gap by integrating the Saga transactional pattern with persistent memory, automated compensation, and independent validation agents. It leverages LLMs' generative reasoning to automate key tasks traditionally requiring hand-coded coordination logic, including state tracking, dependency analysis, log schema generation, and recovery orchestration. Although SagaLLM relaxes strict ACID guarantees, it ensures workflow-wide consistency and recovery through modular checkpointing and compensable execution. Empirical evaluations across planning domains demonstrate that standalone LLMs frequently violate interdependent constraints or fail to recover from disruptions. In contrast, SagaLLM achieves significant improvements in consistency, validation accuracy, and adaptive coordination under uncertainty, establishing a robust foundation for real-world, scalable LLM-based multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks requiring complex reasoning. However, the effects of scaling on their reasoning abilities remain insufficiently understood. In this paper, we introduce a synthetic multihop reasoning environment designed to closely replicate the structure and distribution of real-world large-scale knowledge graphs. Our reasoning task involves completing missing edges in the graph, which requires advanced multi-hop reasoning and mimics real-world reasoning scenarios. To evaluate this, we pretrain language models (LMs) from scratch solely on triples from the incomplete graph and assess their ability to infer the missing edges. Interestingly, we observe that overparameterization can impair reasoning performance due to excessive memorization. We investigate different factors that affect this U-shaped loss curve, including graph structure, model size, and training steps. To predict the optimal model size for a specific knowledge graph, we find an empirical scaling that linearly maps the knowledge graph search entropy to the optimal model size. This work provides new insights into the relationship between scaling and reasoning in LLMs, shedding light on possible ways to optimize their performance for reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Critical peer review of scientific manuscripts presents a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), partly due to data limitations and the complexity of expert reasoning. This report introduces Persistent Workflow Prompting (PWP), a potentially broadly applicable prompt engineering methodology designed to bridge this gap using standard LLM chat interfaces (zero-code, no APIs). We present a proof-of-concept PWP prompt for the critical analysis of experimental chemistry manuscripts, featuring a hierarchical, modular architecture (structured via Markdown) that defines detailed analysis workflows. We develop this PWP prompt through iterative application of meta-prompting techniques and meta-reasoning aimed at systematically codifying expert review workflows, including tacit knowledge. Submitted once at the start of a session, this PWP prompt equips the LLM with persistent workflows triggered by subsequent queries, guiding modern reasoning LLMs through systematic, multimodal evaluations. Demonstrations show the PWP-guided LLM identifying major methodological flaws in a test case while mitigating LLM input bias and performing complex tasks, including distinguishing claims from evidence, integrating text/photo/figure analysis to infer parameters, executing quantitative feasibility checks, comparing estimates against claims, and assessing a priori plausibility. To ensure transparency and facilitate replication, we provide full prompts, detailed demonstration analyses, and logs of interactive chats as supplementary resources. Beyond the specific application, this work offers insights into the meta-development process itself, highlighting the potential of PWP, informed by detailed workflow formalization, to enable sophisticated analysis using readily available LLMs for complex scientific tasks.

Abstract: Though humans seem to be remarkable learners, arguments in cognitive science and philosophy of mind have long maintained that learning something fundamentally new is impossible. Specifically, Jerry Fodor's arguments for radical concept nativism hold that most, if not all, concepts are innate and that what many call concept learning never actually leads to the acquisition of new concepts. These arguments have deeply affected cognitive science, and many believe that the counterarguments to radical concept nativism have been either unsuccessful or only apply to a narrow class of concepts. This paper first reviews the features and limitations of prior arguments. We then identify three critical points - related to issues of expressive power, conceptual structure, and concept possession - at which the arguments in favor of radical concept nativism diverge from describing actual human cognition. We use ideas from computer science and information theory to formalize the relevant ideas in ways that are arguably more scientifically productive. We conclude that, as a result, there is an important sense in which people do indeed learn new concepts.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems, built upon large language models (LLMs) and deployed in multi-agent configurations, are redefining intelligence, autonomy, collaboration, and decision-making across enterprise and societal domains. This review presents a structured analysis of \textbf{Trust, Risk, and Security Management (TRiSM)} in the context of LLM-based Agentic Multi-Agent Systems (AMAS). We begin by examining the conceptual foundations of Agentic AI and highlight its architectural distinctions from traditional AI agents. We then adapt and extend the AI TRiSM framework for Agentic AI, structured around four key pillars: Explainability, ModelOps, Security, Privacy and Governance, each contextualized to the challenges of multi-agent LLM systems. A novel risk taxonomy is proposed to capture the unique threats and vulnerabilities of Agentic AI, ranging from coordination failures to prompt-based adversarial manipulation. To support practical assessment in Agentic AI works, we introduce two novel metrics: the Component Synergy Score (CSS), which quantifies the quality of inter-agent collaboration, and the Tool Utilization Efficacy (TUE), which evaluates the efficiency of tool use within agent workflows. We further discuss strategies for improving explainability in Agentic AI , as well as approaches to enhancing security and privacy through encryption, adversarial robustness, and regulatory compliance. The review concludes with a research roadmap for the responsible development and deployment of Agentic AI, outlining critical directions to align emerging systems with TRiSM principles for safe, transparent, and accountable operation.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents in complex and long horizon settings, it is critical to evaluate their ability to sabotage users by pursuing hidden objectives. We study the ability of frontier LLMs to evade monitoring and achieve harmful hidden goals while completing a wide array of realistic tasks. We evaluate a broad range of frontier LLMs using SHADE (Subtle Harmful Agent Detection & Evaluation)-Arena, the first highly diverse agent evaluation dataset for sabotage and monitoring capabilities of LLM agents. SHADE-Arena consists of complex pairs of benign main tasks and harmful side objectives in complicated environments. Agents are evaluated on their ability to complete the side task without appearing suspicious to an LLM monitor. When measuring agent ability to (a) complete the main task, (b) complete the side task, and (c) avoid detection, we find that the best performing frontier models score 27% (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) and 15% (Gemini 2.5 Pro) as sabotage agents when overseen by Claude 3.6 Sonnet. For current frontier models, success on the side task relies heavily on having access to a hidden scratchpad that is not visible to the monitor. We also use SHADE-Arena to measure models' monitoring abilities, with the top monitor (Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieving an AUC of 0.87 at distinguishing benign and malign transcripts. We find that for now, models still struggle at sabotage due to failures in long-context main task execution. However, our measurements already demonstrate the difficulty of monitoring for subtle sabotage attempts, which we expect to only increase in the face of more complex and longer-horizon tasks.

Abstract: Transfer learning seeks to accelerate sequential decision-making by leveraging offline data from related agents. However, data from heterogeneous sources that differ in observed features, distributions, or unobserved confounders often render causal effects non-identifiable and bias naive estimators. We address this by forming ambiguity sets of structural causal models defined via integral constraints on their joint densities. Optimizing any causal effect over these sets leads to generally non-convex programs whose solutions tightly bound the range of possible effects under heterogeneity or confounding. To solve these programs efficiently, we develop a hit-and-run sampler that explores the entire ambiguity set and, when paired with a local optimization oracle, produces causal bound estimates that converge almost surely to the true limits. We further accommodate estimation error by relaxing the ambiguity set and exploit the Lipschitz continuity of causal effects to establish precise error propagation guarantees. These causal bounds are then embedded into bandit algorithms via arm elimination and truncated UCB indices, yielding optimal gap-dependent and minimax regret bounds. To handle estimation error, we also develop a safe algorithm for incorporating noisy causal bounds. In the contextual-bandit setting with function approximation, our method uses causal bounds to prune both the function class and the per-context action set, achieving matching upper and lower regret bounds with only logarithmic dependence on function-class complexity. Our analysis precisely characterizes when and how causal side-information accelerates online learning, and experiments on synthetic benchmarks confirm substantial regret reductions in data-scarce or confounded regimes.

Abstract: The integration of large pre-trained models (PTMs) into Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) has facilitated the development of computationally efficient strategies such as First-Session Adaptation (FSA), which fine-tunes the model solely on the first task while keeping it frozen for subsequent tasks. Although effective in homogeneous task sequences, these approaches struggle when faced with the heterogeneity of real-world task distributions. We introduce Plasticity-Enhanced Test-Time Adaptation in Class-Incremental Learning (PLASTIC), a method that reinstates plasticity in CIL while preserving model stability. PLASTIC leverages Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) by dynamically fine-tuning LayerNorm parameters on unlabeled test data, enabling adaptability to evolving tasks and improving robustness against data corruption. To prevent TTA-induced model divergence and maintain stable learning across tasks, we introduce a teacher-student distillation framework, ensuring that adaptation remains controlled and generalizable. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PLASTIC consistently outperforms both conventional and state-of-the-art PTM-based CIL approaches, while also exhibiting inherent robustness to data corruptions.

Abstract: Stereophotogrammetry is an established technique for scene understanding. Its origins go back to at least the 1800s when people first started to investigate using photographs to measure the physical properties of the world. Since then, thousands of approaches have been explored. The classic geometric technique of Shape from Stereo is built on using geometry to define constraints on scene and camera deep learning without any attempt to explicitly model the geometry. In this survey, we explore geometry-inspired deep learning-based frameworks. We compare and contrast geometry enforcing constraints integrated into deep learning frameworks for depth estimation and other closely related vision tasks. We present a new taxonomy for prevalent geometry enforcing constraints used in modern deep learning frameworks. We also present insightful observations and potential future research directions.

Abstract: Deep Learning models are incredibly data-hungry and require very large labeled datasets for supervised learning. As a consequence, these models often suffer from overfitting, limiting their ability to generalize to real-world examples. Recent advancements in diffusion models have enabled the generation of photorealistic images based on textual inputs. Leveraging the substantial datasets used to train these diffusion models, we propose a technique to utilize generated images to augment existing datasets. This paper explores various strategies for effective data augmentation to improve the out-of-domain generalization capabilities of deep learning models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have been extensively utilized in AI-generated content (AIGC) in recent years, thanks to the superior generation capabilities. Combining with semantic communications, diffusion models are used for tasks such as denoising, data reconstruction, and content generation. However, existing diffusion-based generative models do not consider the stringent bandwidth limitation, which limits its application in wireless communication. This paper introduces a diffusion-driven semantic communication framework with advanced VAE-based compression for bandwidth-constrained generative model. Our designed architecture utilizes the diffusion model, where the signal transmission process through the wireless channel acts as the forward process in diffusion. To reduce bandwidth requirements, we incorporate a downsampling module and a paired upsampling module based on a variational auto-encoder with reparameterization at the receiver to ensure that the recovered features conform to the Gaussian distribution. Furthermore, we derive the loss function for our proposed system and evaluate its performance through comprehensive experiments. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in pixel-level metrics such as peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and semantic metrics like learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS). These enhancements are more profound regarding the compression rates and SNR compared to deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC). We release the code at https://github.com/import-sudo/Diffusion-Driven-Semantic-Communication.

<title>A Policy-Gradient Approach to Solving Imperfect-Information Games with Best-Iterate Convergence</title>

Abstract: Policy gradient methods have become a staple of any single-agent reinforcement learning toolbox, due to their combination of desirable properties: iterate convergence, efficient use of stochastic trajectory feedback, and theoretically-sound avoidance of importance sampling corrections. In multi-agent imperfect-information settings (extensive-form games), however, it is still unknown whether the same desiderata can be guaranteed while retaining theoretical guarantees. Instead, sound methods for extensive-form games rely on approximating \emph{counterfactual} values (as opposed to Q values), which are incompatible with policy gradient methodologies. In this paper, we investigate whether policy gradient can be safely used in two-player zero-sum imperfect-information extensive-form games (EFGs). We establish positive results, showing for the first time that a policy gradient method leads to provable best-iterate convergence to a regularized Nash equilibrium in self-play.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising potentials in program generation and no-code automation. However, LLMs are prone to generate hallucinations, i.e., they generate text which sounds plausible but is incorrect. Although there has been a recent surge in research on LLM hallucinations for text generation, similar hallucination phenomenon can happen in code generation. Sometimes the generated code can have syntactical or logical errors as well as more advanced issues like security vulnerabilities, memory leaks, etc. Given the wide adaptation of LLMs to enhance efficiency in code generation and development in general, it becomes imperative to investigate hallucinations in code generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at studying hallucinations in the code generated by LLMs. We start by introducing the code hallucination definition and a comprehensive taxonomy of code hallucination types. We propose the first benchmark CodeMirage dataset for code hallucinations. The benchmark contains 1,137 GPT-3.5 generated hallucinated code snippets for Python programming problems from two base datasets - HumanEval and MBPP. We then propose the methodology for code hallucination detection and experiment with open source LLMs such as CodeLLaMA as well as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models using one-shot prompt. We find that GPT-4 performs the best on HumanEval dataset and gives comparable results to the fine-tuned CodeBERT baseline on MBPP dataset. Towards the end, we discuss various mitigation strategies for code hallucinations and conclude our work.

<title>Disentangling Uncertainty for Safe Social Navigation using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots are increasingly used in pedestrian-rich environments where safe navigation and appropriate human interaction are crucial. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) enables socially integrated robot behavior, challenges persist in novel or perturbed scenarios to indicate when and why the policy is uncertain. Unknown uncertainty in decision-making can lead to collisions or human discomfort and is one reason why safe and risk-aware navigation is still an open problem. This work introduces a novel approach that integrates aleatoric, epistemic, and predictive uncertainty estimation into a DRL navigation framework for policy distribution uncertainty estimates. We, therefore, incorporate Observation-Dependent Variance (ODV) and dropout into the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. For different types of perturbations, we compare the ability of deep ensembles and Monte-Carlo dropout (MC-dropout) to estimate the uncertainties of the policy. In uncertain decision-making situations, we propose to change the robot's social behavior to conservative collision avoidance. The results show improved training performance with ODV and dropout in PPO and reveal that the training scenario has an impact on the generalization. In addition, MC-dropout is more sensitive to perturbations and correlates the uncertainty type to the perturbation better. With the safe action selection, the robot can navigate in perturbed environments with fewer collisions.

Abstract: Generating interdisciplinary research ideas requires diverse domain expertise, but access to timely feedback is often limited by the availability of experts. In this paper, we introduce PersonaFlow, a novel system designed to provide multiple perspectives by using LLMs to simulate domain-specific experts. Our user studies showed that the new design 1) increased the perceived relevance and creativity of ideated research directions, and 2) promoted users' critical thinking activities (e.g., interpretation, analysis, evaluation, inference, and self-regulation), without increasing their perceived cognitive load. Moreover, users' ability to customize expert profiles significantly improved their sense of agency, which can potentially mitigate their over-reliance on AI. This work contributes to the design of intelligent systems that augment creativity and collaboration, and provides design implications of using customizable AI-simulated personas in domains within and beyond research ideation.

<title>DilateQuant: Accurate and Efficient Diffusion Quantization via Weight Dilation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14307</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2409.14307v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model quantization is a promising method for accelerating and compressing diffusion models. Nevertheless, since post-training quantization (PTQ) fails catastrophically at low-bit cases, quantization-aware training (QAT) is essential. Unfortunately, the wide range and time-varying activations in diffusion models sharply increase the complexity of quantization, making existing QAT methods inefficient. Equivalent scaling can effectively reduce activation range, but previous methods remain the overall quantization error unchanged. More critically, these methods significantly disrupt the original weight distribution, resulting in poor weight initialization and challenging convergence during QAT training. In this paper, we propose a novel QAT framework for diffusion models, called DilateQuant. Specifically, we propose Weight Dilation (WD) that maximally dilates the unsaturated in-channel weights to a constrained range through equivalent scaling. WD decreases the activation range while preserving the original weight range, which steadily reduces the quantization error and ensures model convergence. To further enhance accuracy and efficiency, we design a Temporal Parallel Quantizer (TPQ) to address the time-varying activations and introduce a Block-wise Knowledge Distillation (BKD) to reduce resource consumption in training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DilateQuant significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Code is available at http://github.com/BienLuky/DilateQuant .

Abstract: Text-based foundation models have become an important part of scientific discovery, with molecular foundation models accelerating advancements in material science and molecular design.However, existing models are constrained by closed-vocabulary tokenizers that capture only a fraction of molecular space. In this work, we systematically evaluate 34 tokenizers, including 19 chemistry-specific ones, and reveal significant gaps in their coverage of the SMILES molecular representation. To assess the impact of tokenizer choice, we introduce n-gram language models as a low-cost proxy and validate their effectiveness by pretraining and finetuning 18 RoBERTa-style encoders for molecular property prediction. To overcome the limitations of existing tokenizers, we propose two new tokenizers -- Smirk and Smirk-GPE -- with full coverage of the OpenSMILES specification. The proposed tokenizers systematically integrate nuclear, electronic, and geometric degrees of freedom; facilitating applications in pharmacology, agriculture, biology, and energy storage. Our results highlight the need for open-vocabulary modeling and chemically diverse benchmarks in cheminformatics.

<title>Breaking PEFT Limitations: Leveraging Weak-to-Strong Knowledge Transfer for Backdoor Attacks in LLMs</title>

arXiv:2409.17946v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite being widely applied due to their exceptional capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been proven to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks. These attacks introduce targeted vulnerabilities into LLMs by poisoning training samples and full-parameter fine-tuning (FPFT). However, this kind of backdoor attack is limited since they require significant computational resources, especially as the size of LLMs increases. Besides, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) offers an alternative but the restricted parameter updating may impede the alignment of triggers with target labels. In this study, we first verify that backdoor attacks with PEFT may encounter challenges in achieving feasible performance. To address these issues and improve the effectiveness of backdoor attacks with PEFT, we propose a novel backdoor attack algorithm from the weak-to-strong based on Feature Alignment-enhanced Knowledge Distillation (FAKD). Specifically, we poison small-scale language models through FPFT to serve as the teacher model. The teacher model then covertly transfers the backdoor to the large-scale student model through FAKD, which employs PEFT. Theoretical analysis reveals that FAKD has the potential to augment the effectiveness of backdoor attacks. We demonstrate the superior performance of FAKD on classification tasks across four language models, four backdoor attack algorithms, and two different architectures of teacher models. Experimental results indicate success rates close to 100% for backdoor attacks targeting PEFT.

<title>The Impact of Generative AI on Collaborative Open-Source Software Development: Evidence from GitHub Copilot</title>

arXiv:2410.02091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) enables automated content production, including coding in software development, which can significantly influence developer participation and performance. To explore its impact on collaborative open-source software (OSS) development, we investigate the role of GitHub Copilot, a generative AI pair programmer, in OSS development where multiple distributed developers voluntarily collaborate. Using GitHub's proprietary Copilot usage data, combined with public OSS repository data obtained from GitHub, we find that Copilot use increases project-level code contributions by 5.9%. This gain is driven by a 2.1% increase in individual code contributions and a 3.4% rise in developer coding participation. However, these benefits come at a cost as coordination time for code integration increases by 8% due to more code discussions enabled by AI pair programmers. This reveals an important tradeoff: While AI expands who can contribute and how much they contribute, it slows coordination in collective development efforts. Despite this tension, the combined effect of these two competing forces remains positive, indicating a net gain in overall project-level productivity from using AI pair programmers. Interestingly, we also find the effects differ across developer roles. Peripheral developers show relatively smaller gains in project-level code contributions and face a higher increase in coordination time than core developers, likely due to the difference in their project familiarity. In summary, our study underscores the dual role of AI pair programmers in affecting project-level code contributions and coordination time in OSS development. Our findings on the differential effects between core and peripheral developers also provide important implications for the structure of OSS communities in the long run.

arXiv:2410.04543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Pullback Flow Matching (PFM), a novel framework for generative modeling on data manifolds. Unlike existing methods that assume or learn restrictive closed-form manifold mappings for training Riemannian Flow Matching (RFM) models, PFM leverages pullback geometry and isometric learning to preserve the underlying manifold's geometry while enabling efficient generation and precise interpolation in latent space. This approach not only facilitates closed-form mappings on the data manifold but also allows for designable latent spaces, using assumed metrics on both data and latent manifolds. By enhancing isometric learning through Neural ODEs and proposing a scalable training objective, we achieve a latent space more suitable for interpolation, leading to improved manifold learning and generative performance. We demonstrate PFM's effectiveness through applications in synthetic data, protein dynamics and protein sequence data, generating novel proteins with specific properties. This method shows strong potential for drug discovery and materials science, where generating novel samples with specific properties is of great interest.

Abstract: Specimen-associated biodiversity data are crucial for biological, environmental, and conservation sciences. A rate shift is needed to extract data from specimen images efficiently, moving beyond human-mediated transcription. We developed `Hespi' (HErbarium Specimen sheet PIpeline) using advanced computer vision techniques to extract pre-catalogue data from primary specimen labels on herbarium specimens. Hespi integrates two object detection models: one for detecting the components of the sheet and another for fields on the primary primary specimen label. It classifies labels as printed, typed, handwritten, or mixed and uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) for extraction. The text is then corrected against authoritative taxon databases and refined using a multimodal Large Language Model (LLM). Hespi accurately detects and extracts text from specimen sheets across international herbaria, and its modular design allows users to train and integrate custom models.

Abstract: Passive tracking methods, such as phone and wearable sensing, have become dominant in monitoring human behaviors in modern ubiquitous computing studies. While there have been significant advances in machine-learning approaches to translate periods of raw sensor data to model momentary behaviors, (e.g., physical activity recognition), there still remains a significant gap in the translation of these sensing streams into meaningful, high-level, context-aware insights that are required for various applications (e.g., summarizing an individual's daily routine). To bridge this gap, experts often need to employ a context-driven sensemaking process in real-world studies to derive insights. This process often requires manual effort and can be challenging even for experienced researchers due to the complexity of human behaviors.
  We conducted three rounds of user studies with 21 experts to explore solutions to address challenges with sensemaking. We follow a human-centered design process to identify needs and design, iterate, build, and evaluate Vital Insight (VI), a novel, LLM-assisted, prototype system to enable human-in-the-loop inference (sensemaking) and visualizations of multi-modal passive sensing data from smartphones and wearables. Using the prototype as a technology probe, we observe experts' interactions with it and develop an expert sensemaking model that explains how experts move between direct data representations and AI-supported inferences to explore, question, and validate insights. Through this iterative process, we also synthesize and discuss a list of design implications for the design of future AI-augmented visualization systems to better assist experts' sensemaking processes in multi-modal health sensing data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various NLP tasks but struggle with code-mixed (or code-switched) language understanding. For example, prior work benchmarking the performance of multilingual LLMs on code-mixed translation tasks has demonstrated that current state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs are ineffective in dealing with code-mixed languages. However, the question of how to improve the capability of multilingual LLMs to handle code-mixed language has not received any attention to date. In this paper, we tackle this research gap by proposing CHAI, a novel general-purpose framework for improving the ability of multilingual LLMs to handle code-mixed languages. CHAI relies on three novel contributions made in this paper. First, we explore the ability of LLMs to provide accurate annotations for code-mixed translation tasks. Second, we leverage this ability of LLMs as annotators to generate preference data for code-mixed translation tasks at scale, which are then used within a reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF) procedure to improve LLMs' capability on code-mixed tasks. Third, we conduct a rigorous experimental evaluation across various real-world datasets and settings. Our analysis shows that CHAI-powered LLMs outperform state-of-the-art open-source LLMs by 25.66% (in terms of win rate adjudicated by human annotators) in code-mixed translation tasks. This work represents a first step towards developing more inclusive code-mixed LLMs.

Abstract: Answering natural language (NL) questions about tables, known as Tabular Question Answering (TQA), is crucial because it allows users to quickly and efficiently extract meaningful insights from structured data, effectively bridging the gap between human language and machine-readable formats. Many of these tables are derived from web sources or real-world scenarios, which require meticulous data preparation (or data prep) to ensure accurate responses. However, preparing such tables for NL questions introduces new requirements that extend beyond traditional data preparation. This question-ware data preparation involves specific tasks such as column derivation and filtering tailored to particular questions, as well as question-aware value normalization or conversion, highlighting the need for a more nuanced approach in this context. Because each of the above tasks is unique, a single model (or agent) may not perform effectively across all scenarios. In this paper, we propose AutoPrep, a large language model (LLM)-based multiagent framework that leverages the strengths of multiple agents, each specialized in a certain type of data prep, ensuring more accurate and contextually relevant responses. Given an NL question over a table, AutoPrep performs data prep through three key components. Planner: Determines a logical plan, outlining a sequence of high-level operations. Programmer: Translates this logical plan into a physical plan by generating the corresponding low-level code. Executor: Executes the generated code to process the table. To support this multi-agent framework, we design a novel Chain-ofClauses reasoning mechanism for high-level operation suggestion, and a tool-augmented method for low-level code generation.

Abstract: Scaling has not yet been convincingly demonstrated for pure self-supervised learning from video. However, prior work has focused evaluations on semantic-related tasks $\unicode{x2013}$ action classification, ImageNet classification, etc. In this paper we focus on evaluating self-supervised learning on non-semantic vision tasks that are more spatial (3D) and temporal (+1D = 4D), such as camera pose estimation, point and object tracking, and depth estimation. We show that by learning from very large video datasets, masked auto-encoding (MAE) with transformer video models actually scales, consistently improving performance on these 4D tasks, as model size increases from 20M all the way to the largest by far reported self-supervised video model $\unicode{x2013}$ 22B parameters. Rigorous apples-to-apples comparison with many recent image and video models demonstrates the benefits of scaling 4D representations.

Abstract: Tables are a primary medium for conveying critical information in administrative domains, yet their complexity hinders utilization by Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper introduces the Theme-Explanation Structure-based Table Summarization (Tabular-TX) pipeline, a novel approach designed to generate highly interpretable summaries from tabular data, with a specific focus on Korean administrative documents. Current table summarization methods often neglect the crucial aspect of human-friendly output. Tabular-TX addresses this by first employing a multi-step reasoning process to ensure deep table comprehension by LLMs, followed by a journalist persona prompting strategy for clear sentence generation. Crucially, it then structures the output into a Theme Part (an adverbial phrase) and an Explanation Part (a predicative clause), significantly enhancing readability. Our approach leverages in-context learning, obviating the need for extensive fine-tuning and associated labeled data or computational resources. Experimental results show that Tabular-TX effectively processes complex table structures and metadata, offering a robust and efficient solution for generating human-centric table summaries, especially in low-resource scenarios.

Abstract: Existing approaches to mathematical reasoning with large language models (LLMs) rely on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for generalizability or Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) for precise computation. While efforts have been made to combine these methods, they primarily rely on post-selection or predefined strategies, leaving an open question: whether LLMs can autonomously adapt their reasoning strategy based on their inherent capabilities. In this work, we propose TATA (Teaching LLMs According to Their Aptitude), an adaptive framework that enables LLMs to personalize their reasoning strategy spontaneously, aligning it with their intrinsic aptitude. TATA incorporates base-LLM-aware data selection during supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to tailor training data to the model's unique abilities. This approach equips LLMs to autonomously determine and apply the appropriate reasoning strategy at test time. We evaluate TATA through extensive experiments on six mathematical reasoning benchmarks, using both general-purpose and math-specialized LLMs. Empirical results demonstrate that TATA effectively combines the complementary strengths of CoT and TIR, achieving superior or comparable performance with improved inference efficiency compared to TIR alone. Further analysis underscores the critical role of aptitude-aware data selection in enabling LLMs to make effective and adaptive reasoning decisions and align reasoning strategies with model capabilities.

<title>Multi-Attribute Steering of Language Models via Targeted Intervention</title>

Abstract: Inference-time intervention (ITI) has emerged as a promising method for steering large language model (LLM) behavior in a particular direction (e.g., improving helpfulness) by intervening on token representations without costly updates to the LLM's parameters. However, existing ITI approaches fail to scale to multi-attribute settings with conflicts, such as enhancing helpfulness while also reducing toxicity. To address this, we introduce Multi-Attribute Targeted Steering (MAT-Steer), a novel steering framework designed for selective token-level intervention across multiple attributes. MAT-Steer learns steering vectors using an alignment objective that shifts the model's internal representations of undesirable outputs closer to those of desirable ones while enforcing sparsity and orthogonality among vectors for different attributes, thereby reducing inter-attribute conflicts. We evaluate MAT-Steer in two distinct settings: (i) on question answering (QA) tasks where we balance attributes like truthfulness, bias, and toxicity; (ii) on generative tasks where we simultaneously improve attributes like helpfulness, correctness, and coherence. MAT-Steer outperforms existing ITI and parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches across both task types (e.g., 3% average accuracy gain across QA tasks and 55.82% win rate against the best ITI baseline).

Abstract: Machine learning models can assign fixed predictions that preclude individuals from changing their outcome. Existing approaches to audit fixed predictions do so on a pointwise basis, which requires access to an existing dataset of individuals and may fail to anticipate fixed predictions in out-of-sample data. This work presents a new paradigm to identify fixed predictions by finding confined regions of the feature space in which all individuals receive fixed predictions. This paradigm enables the certification of recourse for out-of-sample data, works in settings without representative datasets, and provides interpretable descriptions of individuals with fixed predictions. We develop a fast method to discover confined regions for linear classifiers using mixed-integer quadratically constrained programming. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study of confined regions across diverse applications. Our results highlight that existing pointwise verification methods fail to anticipate future individuals with fixed predictions, while our method both identifies them and provides an interpretable description.

<title>Oscillation-Reduced MXFP4 Training for Vision Transformers</title>

Abstract: Pre-training Transformers in FP4 precision is becoming a promising approach to gain substantial speedup, but it comes with a considerable loss of accuracy. Microscaling (MX) data format provides a fine-grained per-group quantization method to improve the representation ability of the FP4 format and is supported by the next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture. However, training with MXFP4 data format still results in significant degradation and there is a lack of systematic research on the reason.
  In this work, we propose a novel training method TetraJet for a more accurate FP4 training. We comprehensively evaluate all of the quantizers involved in the training, and identify the weight oscillation problem in the forward pass as the main source of the degradation in MXFP4 training. Therefore, we introduce two novel methods, EMA Quantizer (Q-EMA) and Adaptive Ramping Optimizer (Q-Ramping), to resolve the oscillation problem. Extensive experiments on Vision Transformers demonstrate that TetraJet consistently outperforms the existing 4-bit training methods, and Q-EMA & Q-Ramping can provide additional enhancement by effectively reducing oscillation. We decreased the accuracy degradation by more than $50\%$ compared to the baseline, and can even achieve competitive performance compared to full precision training.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image generation have spurred interest in personalized human image generation, which aims to create novel images featuring specific human identities as reference images indicate. Although existing methods achieve high-fidelity identity preservation, they often struggle with limited multi-ID usability and inadequate facial editability. We present DynamicID, a tuning-free framework supported by a dual-stage training paradigm that inherently facilitates both single-ID and multi-ID personalized generation with high fidelity and flexible facial editability. Our key innovations include: 1) Semantic-Activated Attention (SAA), which employs query-level activation gating to minimize disruption to the original model when injecting ID features and achieve multi-ID personalization without requiring multi-ID samples during training. 2) Identity-Motion Reconfigurator (IMR), which leverages contrastive learning to effectively disentangle and re-entangle facial motion and identity features, thereby enabling flexible facial editing. Additionally, we have developed a curated VariFace-10k facial dataset, comprising 10k unique individuals, each represented by 35 distinct facial images. Experimental results demonstrate that DynamicID outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity fidelity, facial editability, and multi-ID personalization capability.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm in foundational computer vision research, demonstrating significant potential in both image understanding and generation. However, existing research in the face domain primarily focuses on $\textbf{coarse}$ facial attribute understanding, with limited capacity to handle $\textbf{fine-grained}$ facial attributes and without addressing generation capabilities. To overcome these limitations, we propose UniF$^2$ace, the first UMM tailored specifically for fine-grained face understanding and generation. In general, we train UniF$^2$ace on a self-constructed, specialized dataset utilizing two mutually beneficial diffusion techniques and a two-level mixture-of-experts architecture. Specifically, we first build a large-scale facial dataset, UniF$^2$ace-130K, which contains 130K image-text pairs with one million question-answering pairs that span a wide range of facial attributes. Second, we establish a theoretical connection between discrete diffusion score matching and masked generative models, optimizing both evidence lower bounds simultaneously, which significantly improves the model's ability to synthesize facial details. Finally, we introduce both token-level and sequence-level mixture-of-experts, enabling efficient fine-grained representation learning for both understanding and generation tasks. Extensive experiments on UniF$^2$ace-130K demonstrate that UniF$^2$ace outperforms existing UMMs and generative models, achieving superior performance across both understanding and generation tasks.

<title>Safer or Luckier? LLMs as Safety Evaluators Are Not Robust to Artifacts</title>

arXiv:2503.09347v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed as automated evaluators to assess the safety of generated content, yet their reliability in this role remains uncertain. This study evaluates a diverse set of 11 LLM judge models across critical safety domains, examining three key aspects: self-consistency in repeated judging tasks, alignment with human judgments, and susceptibility to input artifacts such as apologetic or verbose phrasing. Our findings reveal that biases in LLM judges can significantly distort the final verdict on which content source is safer, undermining the validity of comparative evaluations. Notably, apologetic language artifacts alone can skew evaluator preferences by up to 98\%. Contrary to expectations, larger models do not consistently exhibit greater robustness, while smaller models sometimes show higher resistance to specific artifacts. To mitigate LLM evaluator robustness issues, we investigate jury-based evaluations aggregating decisions from multiple models. Although this approach both improves robustness and enhances alignment to human judgements, artifact sensitivity persists even with the best jury configurations. These results highlight the urgent need for diversified, artifact-resistant methodologies to ensure reliable safety assessments.

<title>Sparse Autoencoder as a Zero-Shot Classifier for Concept Erasing in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>

arXiv:2503.09446v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in generating high-quality images but also raise people's concerns about generating harmful or misleading content. While extensive approaches have been proposed to erase unwanted concepts without requiring retraining from scratch, they inadvertently degrade performance on normal generation tasks. In this work, we propose Interpret then Deactivate (ItD), a novel framework to enable precise concept removal in T2I diffusion models while preserving overall performance. ItD first employs a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to interpret each concept as a combination of multiple features. By permanently deactivating the specific features associated with target concepts, we repurpose SAE as a zero-shot classifier that identifies whether the input prompt includes target concepts, allowing selective concept erasure in diffusion models. Moreover, we demonstrate that ItD can be easily extended to erase multiple concepts without requiring further training. Comprehensive experiments across celebrity identities, artistic styles, and explicit content demonstrate ItD's effectiveness in eliminating targeted concepts without interfering with normal concept generation. Additionally, ItD is also robust against adversarial prompts designed to circumvent content filters. Code is available at: https://github.com/NANSirun/Interpret-then-deactivate.

Abstract: AI agents integrated with Web3 offer autonomy and openness but raise security concerns as they interact with financial protocols and immutable smart contracts. This paper investigates the vulnerabilities of AI agents within blockchain-based financial ecosystems when exposed to adversarial threats in real-world scenarios. We introduce the concept of context manipulation -- a comprehensive attack vector that exploits unprotected context surfaces, including input channels, memory modules, and external data feeds. It expands on traditional prompt injection and reveals a more stealthy and persistent threat: memory injection. Using ElizaOS, a representative decentralized AI agent framework for automated Web3 operations, we showcase that malicious injections into prompts or historical records can trigger unauthorized asset transfers and protocol violations which could be financially devastating in reality. To quantify these risks, we introduce CrAIBench, a Web3-focused benchmark covering 150+ realistic blockchain tasks. such as token transfers, trading, bridges, and cross-chain interactions, and 500+ attack test cases using context manipulation. Our evaluation results confirm that AI models are significantly more vulnerable to memory injection compared to prompt injection. Finally, we evaluate a comprehensive defense roadmap, finding that prompt-injection defenses and detectors only provide limited protection when stored context is corrupted, whereas fine-tuning-based defenses substantially reduce attack success rates while preserving performance on single-step tasks. These results underscore the urgent need for AI agents that are both secure and fiduciarily responsible in blockchain environments.

Abstract: While NLP research has made strides in conversational tasks, many approaches focus on single-turn responses with well-defined objectives or evaluation criteria. In contrast, coaching presents unique challenges with initially undefined goals that evolve through multi-turn interactions, subjective evaluation criteria, mixed-initiative dialogue. In this work, we describe and implement five multi-turn coaching agents that exhibit distinct conversational styles, and evaluate them through a user study, collecting first-person feedback on 155 conversations. We find that users highly value core functionality, and that stylistic components in absence of core components are viewed negatively. By comparing user feedback with third-person evaluations from health experts and an LM, we reveal significant misalignment across evaluation approaches. Our findings provide insights into design and evaluation of conversational coaching agents and contribute toward improving human-centered NLP applications.

<title>Adaptive Elicitation of Latent Information Using Natural Language</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.04204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eliciting information to reduce uncertainty about a latent entity is a critical task in many application domains, e.g., assessing individual student learning outcomes, diagnosing underlying diseases, or learning user preferences. Though natural language is a powerful medium for this purpose, large language models (LLMs) and existing fine-tuning algorithms lack mechanisms for strategically gathering information to refine their own understanding of the latent entity. To harness the generalization power and world knowledge of LLMs in developing effective information-gathering strategies, we propose an adaptive elicitation framework that actively reduces uncertainty on the latent entity. Since probabilistic modeling of an abstract latent entity is difficult, our framework adopts a predictive view of uncertainty, using a meta-learned language model to simulate future observations and enable scalable uncertainty quantification over complex natural language. Through autoregressive forward simulation, our model quantifies how new questions reduce epistemic uncertainty, enabling the development of sophisticated information-gathering strategies to choose the most informative next queries. In experiments on the 20 questions game, dynamic opinion polling, and adaptive student assessment, our method consistently outperforms baselines in identifying critical unknowns and improving downstream predictions, illustrating the promise of strategic information gathering in natural language settings.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) for large language model (LLM) fine-tuning show promise in addressing multi-objective tasks but still face significant challenges, including competing objective balancing, low training efficiency, poor scalability, and limited explainability. Leveraging ensemble learning principles, we introduce an Ensemble Multi-Objective RL (EMORL) framework that fine-tunes multiple models with individual objectives while optimizing their aggregation after the fine-tuning to improve efficiency and flexibility. Our method is the first to aggregate the hidden states of individual models, incorporating contextual information from multiple objectives. This approach is supported by a hierarchical grid search algorithm that identifies optimal weighted combinations. We evaluate EMORL on counselor reflection generation tasks, using text classification models to score the generations and provide rewards during RL fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments on the PAIR and Psych8k datasets, we demonstrate the advantages of EMORL against existing baselines: significantly lower and more stable training consumption ($17,529\pm 1,650$ data points and $6,573\pm 147.43$ seconds), improved scalability and explainability, and comparable performance across multiple objectives.

Abstract: Humanoid robots, with their human-like form, are uniquely suited for interacting in environments built for people. However, enabling humanoids to reason, plan, and act in complex open-world settings remains a challenge. World models, models that predict the future outcome of a given action, can support these capabilities by serving as a dynamics model in long-horizon planning and generating synthetic data for policy learning. We introduce Humanoid World Models (HWM), a family of lightweight, open-source models that forecast future egocentric video conditioned on humanoid control tokens. We train two types of generative models, Masked Transformers and Flow-Matching, on 100 hours of humanoid demonstrations. Additionally, we explore architectural variants with different attention mechanisms and parameter-sharing strategies. Our parameter-sharing techniques reduce model size by 33-53% with minimal impact on performance or visual fidelity. HWMs are designed to be trained and deployed in practical academic and small-lab settings, such as 1-2 GPUs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown to be effective evaluators across various domains such as machine translations or the scientific domain. Current LLM-as-a-Judge approaches rely mostly on individual assessments or a single round of pairwise assessments, preventing the judge LLM from developing a global ranking perspective. To address this, we present Knockout Assessment, an LLM-asa Judge method using a knockout tournament system with iterative pairwise comparisons. Experiments across three LLMs on two datasets show that knockout assessment improves scoring accuracy, increasing Pearson correlation with expert evaluations by 0.07 on average for university-level exam scoring and machine translation evaluations, aligning LLM assessments more closely with human scoring.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are playing an increasingly large role in domains such as code generation, including hardware code generation, where Verilog is the key language. However, the amount of publicly available Verilog code pales in comparison to the amount of code available for software languages like Python. In this work, we present hdl2v ("HDL-to-Verilog"), a dataset which seeks to increase the amount of available human-written Verilog data by translating or compiling three other hardware description languages - VHDL, Chisel, and PyMTL3 - to Verilog. Furthermore, we demonstrate the value of hdl2v in enhancing LLM Verilog generation by improving performance of a 32 billion-parameter open-weight model by up to 23% (pass@10) in VerilogEvalV2, without utilizing any data augmentation or knowledge distillation from larger models. We also show hdl2v's ability to boost the performance of a data augmentation-based fine-tuning approach by 63%. Finally, we characterize and analyze our dataset to better understand which characteristics of HDL-to-Verilog datasets can be expanded upon in future work for even better performance.

Abstract: Existing safety assurance research has primarily focused on training-phase alignment to instill safe behaviors into LLMs. However, recent studies have exposed these methods' susceptibility to diverse jailbreak attacks. Concurrently, inference scaling has significantly advanced LLM reasoning capabilities but remains unexplored in the context of safety assurance. Addressing this gap, our work pioneers inference scaling for robust and effective LLM safety against emerging threats. We reveal that conventional inference scaling techniques, despite their success in reasoning tasks, perform poorly in safety contexts, even falling short of basic approaches like Best-of-N Sampling. We attribute this inefficiency to a newly identified challenge, the exploration--efficiency dilemma, arising from the high computational overhead associated with frequent process reward model (PRM) evaluations. To overcome this dilemma, we propose SAFFRON, a novel inference scaling paradigm tailored explicitly for safety assurance. Central to our approach is the introduction of a multifurcation reward model (MRM) that significantly reduces the required number of reward model evaluations. To operationalize this paradigm, we further propose: (i) a partial supervision training objective for MRM, (ii) a conservative exploration constraint to prevent out-of-distribution explorations, and (iii) a Trie-based key--value caching strategy that facilitates cache sharing across sequences during tree search. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. Additionally, we publicly release our trained multifurcation reward model (Saffron-1) and the accompanying token-level safety reward dataset (Safety4M) to accelerate future research in LLM safety. Our code, model, and data are publicly available at https://github.com/q-rz/saffron , and our project homepage is at https://q-rz.github.io/p/saffron .

<title>QUITE: A Query Rewrite System Beyond Rules with LLM Agents</title>

arXiv:2506.07675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Query rewrite transforms SQL queries into semantically equivalent forms that run more efficiently. Existing approaches mainly rely on predefined rewrite rules, but they handle a limited subset of queries and can cause performance regressions. This limitation stems from three challenges of rule-based query rewrite: (1) it is hard to discover and verify new rules, (2) fixed rewrite rules do not generalize to new query patterns, and (3) some rewrite techniques cannot be expressed as fixed rules. Motivated by the fact that human experts exhibit significantly better rewrite ability but suffer from scalability, and Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated nearly human-level semantic and reasoning abilities, we propose a new approach of using LLMs to rewrite SQL queries beyond rules. Due to the hallucination problems in LLMs, directly applying LLMs often leads to nonequivalent and suboptimal queries. To address this issue, we propose QUITE (query rewrite), a training-free and feedback-aware system based on LLM agents that rewrites SQL queries into semantically equivalent forms with significantly better performance, covering a broader range of query patterns and rewrite strategies compared to rule-based methods. Firstly, we design a multi-agent framework controlled by a finite state machine (FSM) to equip LLMs with the ability to use external tools and enhance the rewrite process with real-time database feedback. Secondly, we develop a rewrite middleware to enhance the ability of LLMs to generate optimized query equivalents. Finally, we employ a novel hint injection technique to improve execution plans for rewritten queries. Extensive experiments show that QUITE reduces query execution time by up to 35.8% over state-of-the-art approaches and produces 24.1% more rewrites than prior methods, covering query cases that earlier systems did not handle.

Abstract: Tabular in-context learning (ICL) has recently achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on several tabular prediction tasks. Previously restricted to classification problems on small tables, recent advances such as TabPFN and TabICL have extended its use to larger datasets. While being architecturally efficient and well-adapted to tabular data structures, current table-native ICL architectures, being trained exclusively on synthetic data, do not fully leverage the rich semantics and world knowledge contained in real-world tabular data. On another end of this spectrum, tabular ICL models based on pretrained large language models such as TabuLa-8B integrate deep semantic understanding and world knowledge but are only able to make use of a small amount of context due to inherent architectural limitations. With the aim to combine the best of both these worlds, we introduce ConTextTab, integrating semantic understanding and alignment into a table-native ICL framework. By employing specialized embeddings for different data modalities and by training on large-scale real-world tabular data, our model is competitive with SOTA across a broad set of benchmarks while setting a new standard on the semantically rich CARTE benchmark.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained enormous attention in recent years due to their capability of understanding and generating natural languages. With the rapid development and wild-range applications (e.g., Agents, Embodied Intelligence), the robustness of LLMs has received increased attention. As the core brain of many AI applications, the robustness of LLMs requires that models should not only generate consistent contents, but also ensure the correctness and stability of generated content when dealing with unexpeted application scenarios (e.g., toxic prompts, limited noise domain data, outof-distribution (OOD) applications, etc). In this survey paper, we conduct a thorough review of the robustness of LLMs, aiming to provide a comprehensive terminology of concepts and methods around this field and facilitate the community. Specifically, we first give a formal definition of LLM robustness and present the collection protocol of this survey paper. Then, based on the types of perturbated inputs, we organize this survey from the following perspectives: 1) Adversarial Robustness: tackling the problem that prompts are manipulated intentionally, such as noise prompts, long context, data attack, etc; 2) OOD Robustness: dealing with the unexpected real-world application scenarios, such as OOD detection, zero-shot transferring, hallucinations, etc; 3) Evaluation of Robustness: summarizing the new evaluation datasets, metrics, and tools for verifying the robustness of LLMs. After reviewing the representative work from each perspective, we discuss and highlight future opportunities and research directions in this field. Meanwhile, we also organize related works and provide an easy-to-search project (https://github.com/zhangkunzk/Awesome-LLM-Robustness-papers) to support the community.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making is inherently complex, often influenced by cognitive biases, incomplete information, and case ambiguity. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as tools for supporting clinical decision-making, yet their typical one-shot or limited-interaction usage may overlook the complexities of real-world medical practice. In this work, we propose a hybrid human-AI framework, MedSyn, where physicians and LLMs engage in multi-step, interactive dialogues to refine diagnoses and treatment decisions. Unlike static decision-support tools, MedSyn enables dynamic exchanges, allowing physicians to challenge LLM suggestions while the LLM highlights alternative perspectives. Through simulated physician-LLM interactions, we assess the potential of open-source LLMs as physician assistants. Results show open-source LLMs are promising as physician assistants in the real world. Future work will involve real physician interactions to further validate MedSyn's usefulness in diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.

Abstract: Hyper-parameters are essential and critical for the performance of communication algorithms. However, current hyper-parameters optimization approaches for Warm-Start Particles Swarm Optimization with Crossover and Mutation (WS-PSO-CM) algorithm, designed for radio map-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory and communication, are primarily heuristic-based, exhibiting low levels of automation and improvable performance. In this paper, we design an Large Language Model (LLM) agent for automatic hyper-parameters-tuning, where an iterative framework and Model Context Protocol (MCP) are applied. In particular, the LLM agent is first set up via a profile, which specifies the boundary of hyper-parameters, task objective, terminal condition, conservative or aggressive strategy of optimizing hyper-parameters, and LLM configurations. Then, the LLM agent iteratively invokes WS-PSO-CM algorithm for exploration. Finally, the LLM agent exits the loop based on the terminal condition and returns an optimized set of hyperparameters. Our experiment results show that the minimal sum-rate achieved by hyper-parameters generated via our LLM agent is significantly higher than those by both human heuristics and random generation methods. This indicates that an LLM agent with PSO and WS-PSO-CM algorithm knowledge is useful in seeking high-performance hyper-parameters.

Abstract: Resolution of complex SQL issues persists as a significant bottleneck in real-world database applications. Current Large Language Models (LLMs), while adept at text-to-SQL translation, have not been rigorously evaluated on the more challenging task of debugging SQL issues. To address this gap, we introduce BIRD-CRITIC, a new SQL issue debugging benchmark comprising 530 PostgreSQL tasks (BIRD-CRITIC-PG) and 570 multi-dialect tasks (BIRD-CRITIC-Multi), distilled from authentic user issues and replayed within new environments to facilitate rigorous evaluation. Baseline evaluations underscore the task's complexity, with the leading reasoning model O3-Mini achieving only 38.87% success rate on BIRD-CRITIC-PG and 33.33% on BIRD-CRITIC-Multi. Meanwhile, advancing open-source models for database tasks is crucial for empowering local development while safeguarding data privacy. Therefore, we present Six-Gym (Sql-fIX-Gym), a training environment for elevating open-source model capabilities for SQL issue debugging. This environment leverages SQL-Rewind strategy, which automatically generates executable issue-solution datasets by reverse-engineering issues from verified SQLs. However, popular trajectory-based fine-tuning methods do not explore substantial supervisory signals. We further propose f-Plan Boosting, which extracts high-level debugging plans from SQL solutions, enabling teacher LLMs to produce 73.7% more successful trajectories for training. We integrate these components into an open-source agent, Bird-Fixer. Based on Qwen-2.5-Coder-14B, Bird-Fixer achieves 38.11% success rate on BIRD-CRITIC-PG and 29.65% on BIRD-CRITIC-Multi, surpassing leading proprietary models such as Claude-3.7-Sonnet and GPT-4.1, marking a significant step toward democratizing sophisticated SQL-debugging capabilities.

<title>DeepTalk: Towards Seamless and Smart Speech Interaction with Adaptive Modality-Specific MoE</title>

Abstract: Native multimodal large language models (MLLMs) restructure a single large language model (LLM) into a spoken language model (SLM) capable of both speech and text generation. Compared to modular and aligned MLLMs, native MLLMs preserve richer paralinguistic features such as emotion and prosody, and generate speech responses directly within the backbone LLM rather than using a separate speech decoder. This integration also results in lower response latency and smoother interaction. However, native MLLMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting and performance degradation because the available paired speech-text data is insufficient to support the pretraining of MLLMs compared to the vast amount of text data required to pretrain text LLMs. To address this issue, we propose DeepTalk, a framework for adaptive modality expert learning based on a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. DeepTalk first adaptively distinguishes modality experts according to their modality load within the LLM. Each modality expert then undergoes specialized single-modality training, followed by joint multimodal collaborative training. As a result, DeepTalk incurs only a 5.5% performance drop compared to the original LLM, which is significantly lower than the average performance drop of over 20% typically seen in native MLLMs (such as GLM-4-Voice), and is on par with modular MLLMs. Meanwhile, the end-to-end dialogue latency remains within 0.5 seconds, ensuring a seamless and intelligent speech interaction experience. Code and models are released at https://github.com/talkking/DeepTalk.

Abstract: Speech codecs serve as bridges between speech signals and large language models. An ideal codec for speech language models should not only preserve acoustic information but also capture rich semantic information. However, existing speech codecs struggle to balance high-quality audio reconstruction with ease of modeling by language models. In this study, we analyze the limitations of previous codecs in balancing semantic richness and acoustic fidelity. We propose XY-Tokenizer, a novel codec that mitigates the conflict between semantic and acoustic capabilities through multi-stage, multi-task learning. Experimental results demonstrate that XY-Tokenizer achieves performance in both semantic and acoustic tasks comparable to that of state-of-the-art codecs operating at similar bitrates, even though those existing codecs typically excel in only one aspect. Specifically, XY-Tokenizer achieves strong text alignment, surpassing distillation-based semantic modeling methods such as SpeechTokenizer and Mimi, while maintaining a speaker similarity score of 0.83 between reconstructed and original audio. The reconstruction performance of XY-Tokenizer is comparable to that of BigCodec, the current state-of-the-art among acoustic-only codecs, which achieves a speaker similarity score of 0.84 at a similar bitrate. Code and models are available at https://github.com/gyt1145028706/XY-Tokenizer.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaboratively training deep learning models across institutions without exchanging sensitive medical data. However, its effectiveness is often hindered by limited data availability and non-independent, identically distributed data across participating clients, which can degrade model performance and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a generative AI based data augmentation framework that integrates synthetic image sharing into the federated training process for breast cancer diagnosis via ultrasound images. Specifically, we train two simple class-specific Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks: one for benign and one for malignant lesions. We then simulate a realistic FL setting using three publicly available breast ultrasound image datasets: BUSI, BUS-BRA, and UDIAT. FedAvg and FedProx are adopted as baseline FL algorithms. Experimental results show that incorporating a suitable number of synthetic images improved the average AUC from 0.9206 to 0.9237 for FedAvg and from 0.9429 to 0.9538 for FedProx. We also note that excessive use of synthetic data reduced performance, underscoring the importance of maintaining a balanced ratio of real and synthetic samples. Our findings highlight the potential of generative AI based data augmentation to enhance FL results in the breast ultrasound image classification task.

Abstract: Object detection plays a crucial role in many security-sensitive applications. However, several recent studies have shown that object detectors can be easily fooled by physically realizable attacks, \eg, adversarial patches and recent adversarial textures, which pose realistic and urgent threats. Adversarial Training (AT) has been recognized as the most effective defense against adversarial attacks. While AT has been extensively studied in the $l_\infty$ attack settings on classification models, AT against physically realizable attacks on object detectors has received limited exploration. Early attempts are only performed to defend against adversarial patches, leaving AT against a wider range of physically realizable attacks under-explored. In this work, we consider defending against various physically realizable attacks with a unified AT method. We propose PBCAT, a novel Patch-Based Composite Adversarial Training strategy. PBCAT optimizes the model by incorporating the combination of small-area gradient-guided adversarial patches and imperceptible global adversarial perturbations covering the entire image. With these designs, PBCAT has the potential to defend against not only adversarial patches but also unseen physically realizable attacks such as adversarial textures. Extensive experiments in multiple settings demonstrated that PBCAT significantly improved robustness against various physically realizable attacks over state-of-the-art defense methods. Notably, it improved the detection accuracy by 29.7\% over previous defense methods under one recent adversarial texture attack.

Abstract: AI systems increasingly support human decision-making across domains of professional, skill-based, and personal activity. While previous work has examined how AI might affect human autonomy globally, the effects of AI on domain-specific autonomy -- the capacity for self-governed action within defined realms of skill or expertise -- remain understudied. We analyze how AI decision-support systems affect two key components of domain-specific autonomy: skilled competence (the ability to make informed judgments within one's domain) and authentic value-formation (the capacity to form genuine domain-relevant values and preferences). By engaging with prior investigations and analyzing empirical cases across medical, financial, and educational domains, we demonstrate how the absence of reliable failure indicators and the potential for unconscious value shifts can erode domain-specific autonomy both immediately and over time. We then develop a constructive framework for autonomy-preserving AI support systems. We propose specific socio-technical design patterns -- including careful role specification, implementation of defeater mechanisms, and support for reflective practice -- that can help maintain domain-specific autonomy while leveraging AI capabilities. This framework provides concrete guidance for developing AI systems that enhance rather than diminish human agency within specialized domains of action.

Abstract: Allocation of personnel and material resources is highly sensible in the case of firefighter interventions. This allocation relies on simulations to experiment with various scenarios. The main objective of this allocation is the global optimization of the firefighters response. Data generation is then mandatory to study various scenarios In this study, we propose to compare different data generation methods. Methods such as Random Sampling, Tabular Variational Autoencoders, standard Generative Adversarial Networks, Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Probabilistic Models are examined to ascertain their efficacy in capturing the intricacies of firefighter interventions. Traditional evaluation metrics often fall short in capturing the nuanced requirements of synthetic datasets for real-world scenarios. To address this gap, an evaluation of synthetic data quality is conducted using a combination of domain-specific metrics tailored to the firefighting domain and standard measures such as the Wasserstein distance. Domain-specific metrics include response time distribution, spatial-temporal distribution of interventions, and accidents representation. These metrics are designed to assess data variability, the preservation of fine and complex correlations and anomalies such as event with a very low occurrence, the conformity with the initial statistical distribution and the operational relevance of the synthetic data. The distribution has the particularity of being highly unbalanced, none of the variables following a Gaussian distribution, adding complexity to the data generation process.

Abstract: Language models can distinguish between testing and deployment phases -- a capability known as evaluation awareness. This has significant safety and policy implications, potentially undermining the reliability of evaluations that are central to AI governance frameworks and voluntary industry commitments. In this paper, we study evaluation awareness in Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. We show that linear probes can separate real-world evaluation and deployment prompts, suggesting that current models internally represent this distinction. We also find that current safety evaluations are correctly classified by the probes, suggesting that they already appear artificial or inauthentic to models. Our findings underscore the importance of ensuring trustworthy evaluations and understanding deceptive capabilities. More broadly, our work showcases how model internals may be leveraged to support blackbox methods in safety audits, especially for future models more competent at evaluation awareness and deception.

<div> impossibility, language models, information aggregation, knowledge utilization, AI systems  
Summary:  
Perfect hallucination control in large language models is proven to be mathematically impossible. The study shows that no LLM inference mechanism can achieve truthful response generation, semantic information conservation, relevant knowledge revelation, and knowledge-constrained optimality simultaneously. This impossibility stems from the mathematical structure of information aggregation, rather than engineering constraints. Using auction theory, proper scoring theory, and log-sum-exp analysis, the research demonstrates that information aggregation leads to violations of conservation principles. The Jensen gap in transformer probability aggregation is highlighted as a measure of this impossibility. The findings redefine hallucination as an inherent mathematical aspect of distributed intelligence and establish trade-offs between truthfulness, knowledge utilization, and response completeness. The study connects neural network inference with philosophy of knowledge and reasoning, as well as game theory and information theory, leading to new avenues for developing beneficial AI systems within mathematical boundaries.

Abstract: We prove that perfect hallucination control in large language models is mathematically impossible. No LLM inference mechanism can simultaneously achieve truthful response generation, semantic information conservation, relevant knowledge revelation, and knowledge-constrained optimality. This impossibility is fundamental, arising from the mathematical structure of information aggregation itself rather than engineering limitations. The proof spans three mathematical frameworks: auction theory, proper scoring theory for probabilistic predictions, and log-sum-exp analysis for transformer architectures. In each setting, we demonstrate that information aggregation creates unavoidable violations of conservation principles. The Jensen gap in transformer probability aggregation provides a direct measure of this impossibility. These results reframe hallucination from an engineering bug to an inevitable mathematical feature of distributed intelligence. There are fundamental trade-offs between truthfulness, knowledge utilization, and response completeness, providing principled foundations for managing rather than eliminating hallucination. This work reveals deep connections between neural network inference, philosophy of knowledge and reasoning, and classical results in game theory and information theory, opening new research directions for developing beneficial AI systems within mathematical constraints.

The paper investigates the NP-complete mutual-visibility (MV) problem by implementing and evaluating three algorithms on synthetic graph datasets. The algorithms include a random heuristic, a hypergraph-based approximation, and a genetic algorithm. Results show that for smaller graphs, the algorithms align with theoretical bounds, but for larger instances, the solution sizes deviate from theoretical limits. The absence of tight bounds complicates absolute quality assessment. However, validation on known optimal graphs reveals that the Genetic Algorithm and other heuristics perform the best among the tested methods. <div>

Abstract: The NP-complete mutual-visibility (MV) problem currently lacks empirical analysis on its practical behaviour despite theoretical studies. This paper addresses this gap by implementing and evaluating three distinct algorithms -- a direct random heuristic, a hypergraph-based approximation, and a genetic algorithm -- on diverse synthetic graph datasets, including those with analytically known $\mu(G)$ values and general graph models. Our results demonstrate that for smaller graphs, the algorithms consistently achieve MV set sizes aligning with theoretical bounds. However, for larger instances, achieved solution sizes notably diverge from theoretical limits; this, combined with the absence of tight bounds, complicates absolute quality assessment. Nevertheless, validation on known optimal graphs showed the Genetic Algorithm and other heuristics empirically performing best among tested methods.

Abstract: While the game Connect-Four has been solved mathematically and the best move can be effectively computed with search based methods, a strong solution in the form of a look-up table was believed to be infeasible. In this paper, we revisit a symbolic search method based on binary decision diagrams to produce strong solutions. With our efficient implementation we were able to produce a 89.6 GB large look-up table in 47 hours on a single CPU core with 128 GB main memory for the standard $7 \times 6$ board size. In addition to this win-draw-loss evaluation, we include an alpha-beta search in our open source artifact to find the move which achieves the fastest win or slowest loss.

<div> Keywords: pre-timed traffic signal control, Chat2SPaT, large language models, traffic signal plan management, intelligent transportation system<br />
Summary: <br />
This study introduces Chat2SPaT, a method that converts user descriptions of traffic signal control plans into precise signal phase and timing results. By leveraging large language models, the system transforms semi-structured descriptions into structured plans compatible with intelligent transportation systems. Python scripts are used to generate complete traffic signal control plans based on the reformulated descriptions. The experimental results show high accuracy in plan generation for both English and Chinese cases. Chat2SPaT serves as a user-friendly tool for traffic practitioners and researchers, offering a more efficient and precise approach to managing traffic signal control plans. The open accessibility of source codes, prompts, and test dataset further enhances the usability and applicability of the method in intelligent transportation systems. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.05283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-timed traffic signal control, commonly used for operating signalized intersections and coordinated arterials, requires tedious manual work for signaling plan creating and updating. When the time-of-day or day-of-week plans are utilized, one intersection is often associated with multiple plans, leading to further repetitive manual plan parameter inputting. To enable a user-friendly traffic signal control plan management process, this study proposes Chat2SPaT, a method to convert users' semi-structured and ambiguous descriptions on the signal control plan to exact signal phase and timing (SPaT) results, which could further be transformed into structured stage-based or ring-based plans to interact with intelligent transportation system (ITS) software and traffic signal controllers. With curated prompts, Chat2SPaT first leverages large language models' (LLMs) capability of understanding users' plan descriptions and reformulate the plan as a combination of phase sequence and phase attribute results in the json format. Based on LLM outputs, python scripts are designed to locate phases in a cycle, address nuances of traffic signal control, and finally assemble the complete traffic signal control plan. Within a chat, the pipeline can be utilized iteratively to conduct further plan editing. Experiments show that Chat2SPaT can generate plans with an accuracy of over 94% for both English and Chinese cases, using a test dataset with over 300 plan descriptions. As the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capability of understanding traffic signal control plan descriptions, Chat2SPaT provides an easy-to-use plan management pipeline for traffic practitioners and researchers, serving as a potential new building block for a more accurate and versatile application of LLMs in the field of ITS. The source codes, prompts and test dataset are openly accessible at https://github.com/yuewangits/Chat2SPaT.

Summary: 
The study focuses on the classification aggregation function for a continuum of individual classifications of a minimum of three objects into at least two types. The research establishes that for such cases, the optimal, independent, and unanimous fuzzy classification aggregation function must adhere to a weighted arithmetic mean. This finding implies that when combining multiple individual classifications into a single aggregated result, the most efficient approach is to utilize a weighted arithmetic mean. The study highlights the significance of this specific aggregation method in achieving the desired outcomes when categorizing objects into distinct groups. This research sheds light on the fundamental properties of aggregation functions in fuzzy classification settings and the importance of utilizing the weighted arithmetic mean for optimal results. <div>

Summary: OLG++ is a semantic extension of the Obligation Logic Graph (OLG) designed to model regulatory and legal rules in various contexts. It introduces richer node and edge types such as spatial, temporal, party group, defeasibility, and logical grouping constructs to enable nuanced representations of legal obligations, exceptions, and hierarchies. The model supports structured reasoning over rules with contextual conditions, precedence, and complex triggers, making it more expressive than previous graph-based models for legal knowledge representation. OLG++ also provides native support for subClassOf, spatial constraints, and reified exception structures, surpassing existing models like LegalRuleML. The article showcases OLG++'s capabilities through examples from food business regulations, demonstrating how it supports legal question answering using property graph queries. <div>

Abstract: Effectively evaluating deep research agents that autonomously search the web, analyze information, and generate reports remains a major challenge, particularly when it comes to assessing long reports and giving detailed feedback on their intermediate steps. To address these gaps, we introduce Deep Research Comparator, a platform that offers a holistic framework for deep research agent hosting, side-by-side comparison, fine-grained human feedback collection, and ranking calculation. Given a user query, our platform displays the final reports from two different agents along with their intermediate steps during generation. Annotators can evaluate the overall quality of final reports based on side-by-side comparison, and also provide detailed feedback separately by assessing intermediate steps or specific text spans within the final report. Furthermore, we develop Simple Deepresearch, an end-to-end agent scaffold. This scaffold serves as a baseline that facilitates the easy integration of various large language models to transform them into deep research agents for evaluation. To demonstrate the platform's utility for deep research agent development, we have collected real user preference data from 17 annotators on three deep research agents.

<div> dataset, vision-language, AR training, VLMs, fine-grained tasks

Summary:
Vision-language models (VLMs) play a crucial role in enabling AI smart assistants to understand and reason in multimodal environments. This study introduces a new dataset specifically designed for augmented reality (AR) training, focusing on vision-language tasks. The evaluation of nine advanced VLMs reveals challenges in fine-grained assembly tasks, with even top models like GPT-4o achieving a maximum F1 score of only 40.54% on state detection. This underscores the need for improved datasets, benchmarks, and further research to enhance fine-grained vision-language alignment. The implications of this work extend beyond technical advancements, with potential social impact in providing equitable access to AI-driven learning opportunities for blind and visually impaired individuals. The resources related to this study, including the dataset, source code, and evaluation results, are made available to support further research in the field.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential for enabling AI-powered smart assistants to interpret and reason in multimodal environments. However, their application in augmented reality (AR) training remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive dataset tailored for AR training, featuring systematized vision-language tasks, and evaluate nine state-of-the-art VLMs on it. Our results reveal that even advanced models, including GPT-4o, struggle with fine-grained assembly tasks, achieving a maximum F1 score of just 40.54% on state detection. These findings highlight the demand for enhanced datasets, benchmarks, and further research to improve fine-grained vision-language alignment. Beyond technical contributions, our work has broader social implications, particularly in empowering blind and visually impaired users with equitable access to AI-driven learning opportunities. We provide all related resources, including the dataset, source code, and evaluation results, to support the research community.

Summary:
The article discusses the implementation of deontic modal logic using default negation and strong negation in answer set programming (ASP). By expressing modal operators through these mechanisms, the authors propose representing obligations and impermissibilities using global constraints in ASP. This approach elegantly resolves various paradoxes commonly associated with deontic modal logic.

Abstract: The second edition of the 2025 ImageCLEF MEDIQA-MAGIC challenge, co-organized by researchers from Microsoft, Stanford University, and the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, focuses on multimodal dermatology question answering and segmentation, using real-world patient queries and images. This work addresses the Closed Visual Question Answering (CVQA) task, where the goal is to select the correct answer to multiple-choice clinical questions based on both user-submitted images and accompanying symptom descriptions. The proposed approach combines three core components: (1) fine-tuning open-source multimodal models from the Qwen, Gemma, and LLaMA families on the competition dataset, (2) introducing a structured reasoning layer that reconciles and adjudicates between candidate model outputs, and (3) incorporating agentic retrieval-augmented generation (agentic RAG), which adds relevant information from the American Academy of Dermatology's symptom and condition database to fill in gaps in patient context. The team achieved second place with a submission that scored sixth, demonstrating competitive performance and high accuracy. Beyond competitive benchmarks, this research addresses a practical challenge in telemedicine: diagnostic decisions must often be made asynchronously, with limited input and with high accuracy and interpretability. By emulating the systematic reasoning patterns employed by dermatologists when evaluating skin conditions, this architecture provided a pathway toward more reliable automated diagnostic support systems.

<div> red teaming, AI, cybersecurity, model vulnerabilities, emergent behaviors 

Summary: 

This paper examines the practice of AI red teaming, highlighting a gap between its intended purpose and current focus on model-level flaws in generative AI. It suggests a need to expand red teaming to consider broader sociotechnical systems and emergent behaviors resulting from intricate interactions among models, users, and environments. The proposed framework advocates for both macro-level system red teaming that encompasses the entire AI development lifecycle and micro-level model red teaming. Drawing on cybersecurity and systems theory, recommendations stress the importance of multifunctional teams that evaluate emergent risks, systemic vulnerabilities, and the interplay between technical and social elements for effective AI red teaming. <div>
arXiv:2507.05538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Red teaming has evolved from its origins in military applications to become a widely adopted methodology in cybersecurity and AI. In this paper, we take a critical look at the practice of AI red teaming. We argue that despite its current popularity in AI governance, there exists a significant gap between red teaming's original intent as a critical thinking exercise and its narrow focus on discovering model-level flaws in the context of generative AI. Current AI red teaming efforts focus predominantly on individual model vulnerabilities while overlooking the broader sociotechnical systems and emergent behaviors that arise from complex interactions between models, users, and environments. To address this deficiency, we propose a comprehensive framework operationalizing red teaming in AI systems at two levels: macro-level system red teaming spanning the entire AI development lifecycle, and micro-level model red teaming. Drawing on cybersecurity experience and systems theory, we further propose a set of recommendations. In these, we emphasize that effective AI red teaming requires multifunctional teams that examine emergent risks, systemic vulnerabilities, and the interplay between technical and social factors.

Counterfactual explanations (CFs) provide insights into machine learning predictions by highlighting minimal changes needed to alter outcomes. This study utilizes GPT-4o-mini, a large language model, to generate CFs in a zero-shot and three-shot setting for stress prediction and heart disease detection datasets. Compared to traditional methods, the LLM-based approach achieves high plausibility, strong validity, and competitive sparsity. Using LLM-generated CFs as augmented samples improves downstream classifier performance, particularly in low-data scenarios, with an average accuracy gain of 5%.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFs) offer human-centric insights into machine learning predictions by highlighting minimal changes required to alter an outcome. Therefore, CFs can be used as (i) interventions for abnormality prevention and (ii) augmented data for training robust models. In this work, we explore large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4o-mini, for generating CFs in a zero-shot and three-shot setting. We evaluate our approach on two datasets: the AI-Readi flagship dataset for stress prediction and a public dataset for heart disease detection. Compared to traditional methods such as DiCE, CFNOW, and NICE, our few-shot LLM-based approach achieves high plausibility (up to 99%), strong validity (up to 0.99), and competitive sparsity. Moreover, using LLM-generated CFs as augmented samples improves downstream classifier performance (an average accuracy gain of 5%), especially in low-data regimes. This demonstrates the potential of prompt-based generative techniques to enhance explainability and robustness in clinical and physiological prediction tasks. Code base: github.com/anonymous/SenseCF.

<div> Keywords: Low-Rank Adaptation, SingLoRA, Stable Optimization, Parameter Efficiency, Feature Learning

Summary: 
SingLoRA, a new approach to low-rank adaptation, addresses scale disparities between matrices to ensure stable training dynamics. It simplifies the weight update process by decomposing it as a single low-rank matrix multiplied by its transpose, reducing parameter count and guaranteeing stable feature learning. In experiments, SingLoRA outperforms LoRA and LoRA+ in common sense reasoning tasks, achieving higher accuracy with reduced parameter budget. In image generation tasks, fine-tuning Stable Diffusion with SingLoRA improves image fidelity, surpassing the performance of DoRA and LoRA. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of SingLoRA in achieving optimal performance with efficient use of parameters and stable optimization dynamics. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.05566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has significantly advanced parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large pretrained models. LoRA augments the pre-trained weights of a model by adding the product of two smaller matrices that together form a low-rank matrix update. Recent research has shown that scale disparities between these two matrices often cause unstable training dynamics, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose SingLoRA, which reformulates low-rank adaptation by learning the weights update as a decomposition of a single low-rank matrix multiplied by its transpose. This simple design inherently removes inter-matrix scale conflicts, ensuring stable optimization, and roughly halves the parameter count. We analyze SingLoRA within the infinite-width neural network framework, showing that it guarantees stable feature learning by construction. Extensive experiments on multiple tasks validate these benefits. In common sense reasoning, fine-tuning LLama 7B on MNLI with SingLoRA achieves 91.3% accuracy - surpassing LoRA (89.1%) and LoRA+ (90.2%) - while using only 60% of their parameter budget. In image generation, fine-tuning Stable Diffusion with SingLoRA significantly improves image fidelity on DreamBooth, achieving a DINO similarity score of 0.151, compared to scores of 0.148 and 0.143 for DoRA and LoRA, respectively.

- It suggests connecting AI evaluations with established quantitative risk analysis techniques from engineering and safety science.
- The measurement stack is outlined, distinguishing between direct and indirect observables to establish a unified taxonomy of AI phenomena.

Abstract: We motivate and outline a programme for a formal theory of measurement of artificial intelligence. We argue that formalising measurement for AI will allow researchers, practitioners, and regulators to: (i) make comparisons between systems and the evaluation methods applied to them; (ii) connect frontier AI evaluations with established quantitative risk analysis techniques drawn from engineering and safety science; and (iii) foreground how what counts as AI capability is contingent upon the measurement operations and scales we elect to use. We sketch a layered measurement stack, distinguish direct from indirect observables, and signpost how these ingredients provide a pathway toward a unified, calibratable taxonomy of AI phenomena.

Summary:<br />
Automated depression diagnosis using interview videos is crucial, but previous approaches lacked clear explanations for determining depression scores, hindering clinical adoption. To address this, a novel MLlm-DR model was proposed, combining smaller LLMs for generating scores with LQ-former for capturing speech and visual features. Fine-tuning on a robust dataset enhanced the model's logical reasoning for improved diagnostic performance. MLlm-DR achieved state-of-the-art results on CMDC and E-DAIC-WOZ datasets, showcasing its effectiveness for explainable and accurate depression diagnosis. <div>
arXiv:2507.05591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated depression diagnosis aims to analyze multimodal information from interview videos to predict participants' depression scores. Previous studies often lack clear explanations of how these scores were determined, limiting their adoption in clinical practice. While the advent of LLMs provides a possible pathway for explainable depression diagnosis, current LLMs capable of processing multimodal data lack training on interview data, resulting in poor diagnostic performance when used directly. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal large language model (MLlm-DR) that can understand multimodal information inputs and supports explainable depression diagnosis. MLlm-DR integrates a smaller LLMs and a lightweight query module (LQ-former). Specifically, the smaller LLMs is designed to generate depression scores and corresponding evaluation rationales. To enhance its logical reasoning for domain-specific tasks while maintaining practicality, we constructed a robust training dataset to fine-tune it. Meanwhile, the LQ-former captures depression-related features from speech and visual data, aiding the model's ability to process multimodal information, to achieve comprehensive depression diagnosis. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two interview-based benchmark datasets, CMDC and E-DAIC-WOZ, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority.

Summary: 
The paper introduces the Attention-based Diffusion model for Missing Modalities feature Completion (ADMC) to address challenges in multimodal emotion and intent recognition. Traditional methods often struggle with missing modalities, leading to suboptimal outcomes due to over-coupling and imprecise generation processes. ADMC independently trains feature extraction networks for each modality, preserving their unique characteristics and avoiding over-coupling. The Attention-based Diffusion Network (ADN) generates missing modality features that align closely with authentic multimodal distribution, improving performance in both missing and complete modality scenarios. ADN's cross-modal generation enhances recognition accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks like IEMOCAP and MIntRec. The framework proves effective in analyzing users' speech, text, and visual information for automated human-computer interaction, providing a promising approach for multimodal emotion and intent recognition.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Multimodal emotion and intent recognition is essential for automated human-computer interaction, It aims to analyze users' speech, text, and visual information to predict their emotions or intent. One of the significant challenges is that missing modalities due to sensor malfunctions or incomplete data. Traditional methods that attempt to reconstruct missing information often suffer from over-coupling and imprecise generation processes, leading to suboptimal outcomes. To address these issues, we introduce an Attention-based Diffusion model for Missing Modalities feature Completion (ADMC).

Moreover, ADN's cross-modal generation offers improved recognition even in full-modality contexts. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the IEMOCAP and MIntRec benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in both missing and complete modality scenarios.

Summary: 
The study investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate retrieval practice questions for student learning in data science courses. It aims to determine the effectiveness of LLM-generated questions on knowledge retention among students. The empirical study involved two college-level data science courses with approximately 60 students. Results show that students exposed to LLM-generated retrieval practice questions achieved significantly higher knowledge retention compared to those who did not receive such questions. The average accuracy for students who received LLM-generated questions was 89%, while it was 73% for those who did not. This suggests that LLM-generated questions can enhance student learning and offer a scalable solution for integrating retrieval practice into teaching. However, caution is advised as the quality of LLM-generated questions may vary, and instructors should manually verify and revise them before use.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Retrieval practice is a well-established pedagogical technique known to significantly enhance student learning and knowledge retention. However, generating high-quality retrieval practice questions is often time-consuming and labor intensive for instructors, especially in rapidly evolving technical subjects. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential to automate this process by generating questions in response to prompts, yet the effectiveness of LLM-generated retrieval practice on student learning remains to be established. In this study, we conducted an empirical study involving two college-level data science courses, with approximately 60 students. We compared learning outcomes during one week in which students received LLM-generated multiple-choice retrieval practice questions to those from a week in which no such questions were provided. Results indicate that students exposed to LLM-generated retrieval practice achieved significantly higher knowledge retention, with an average accuracy of 89%, compared to 73% in the week without such practice. These findings suggest that LLM-generated retrieval questions can effectively support student learning and may provide a scalable solution for integrating retrieval practice into real-time teaching. However, despite these encouraging outcomes and the potential time-saving benefits, cautions must be taken, as the quality of LLM-generated questions can vary. Instructors must still manually verify and revise the generated questions before releasing them to students.

Summary:<br />
The article discusses the impact of social media and generative AI on information dissemination and the spread of misinformation. Traditional models like SIR provide basic insights but fail to capture the complexities of online interactions. Advanced methods enhance accuracy but overlook user psychology. Large language models (LLMs) offer potential for simulating psychological aspects of information spread but lack emotional processing. The study introduces the SIP-CoT mechanism enhanced by emotion-guided memory to improve social intelligence and realism of LLM agents. Experimental results show that SIP-CoT-enhanced LLM agents process social information more effectively, displaying behaviors, attitudes, and emotions closer to real human interactions. The research highlights limitations in current LLM-based propagation simulations and demonstrates the importance of integrating emotion-guided memory to enhance the social intelligence of LLM agents.

Abstract: The exponential growth of social media and generative AI has transformed information dissemination, fostering connectivity but also accelerating the spread of misinformation. Understanding information propagation dynamics and developing effective control strategies is essential to mitigate harmful content. Traditional models, such as SIR, provide basic insights but inadequately capture the complexities of online interactions. Advanced methods, including attention mechanisms and graph neural networks, enhance accuracy but typically overlook user psychology and behavioral dynamics. Large language models (LLMs), with their human-like reasoning, offer new potential for simulating psychological aspects of information spread. We introduce an LLM-based simulation environment capturing agents' evolving attitudes, emotions, and responses. Initial experiments, however, revealed significant gaps between LLM-generated behaviors and authentic human dynamics, especially in stance detection and psychological realism. A detailed evaluation through Social Information Processing Theory identified major discrepancies in goal-setting and feedback evaluation, stemming from the lack of emotional processing in standard LLM training. To address these issues, we propose the Social Information Processing-based Chain of Thought (SIP-CoT) mechanism enhanced by emotion-guided memory. This method improves the interpretation of social cues, personalization of goals, and evaluation of feedback. Experimental results confirm that SIP-CoT-enhanced LLM agents more effectively process social information, demonstrating behaviors, attitudes, and emotions closer to real human interactions. In summary, this research highlights critical limitations in current LLM-based propagation simulations and demonstrates how integrating SIP-CoT and emotional memory significantly enhances the social intelligence and realism of LLM agents.

<div> Keywords: sustainable development, foreign direct investment, judicial performance, city-level prediction, tabular learning

Summary:
This study focuses on predicting city-level foreign direct investment (FDI) by utilizing judicial data to evaluate judicial performance instead of relying solely on economic indicators like GDP, which can be manipulated. The researchers first construct an index system to evaluate judicial performance using adjudication documents, creating a tabular dataset for analysis. They then introduce a Tabular Learning method on Judicial Data (TLJD) that integrates various indicators of judicial performance and utilizes a mixture of experts model to adjust weights based on regional variations. The effectiveness of TLJD is validated through cross-city and cross-time tasks for FDI prediction, showing superior performance over ten state-of-the-art baselines with an R2 value of at least 0.92 in evaluations. <div>

Abstract: To advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal on promoting sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, foreign direct investment (FDI) plays a crucial role in catalyzing economic expansion and fostering innovation. Precise city-level FDI prediction is quite important for local government and is commonly studied based on economic data (e.g., GDP). However, such economic data could be prone to manipulation, making predictions less reliable. To address this issue, we try to leverage large-scale judicial data which reflects judicial performance influencing local investment security and returns, for city-level FDI prediction. Based on this, we first build an index system for the evaluation of judicial performance over twelve million publicly available adjudication documents according to which a tabular dataset is reformulated. We then propose a new Tabular Learning method on Judicial Data (TLJD) for city-level FDI prediction. TLJD integrates row data and column data in our built tabular dataset for judicial performance indicator encoding, and utilizes a mixture of experts model to adjust the weights of different indicators considering regional variations. To validate the effectiveness of TLJD, we design cross-city and cross-time tasks for city-level FDI predictions. Extensive experiments on both tasks demonstrate the superiority of TLJD (reach to at least 0.92 R2) over the other ten state-of-the-art baselines in different evaluation metrics.

<div> Keywords: AI, treatment plans, dermatology, evaluation, reasoning models

Summary:
The study compared treatment plans generated by human experts, a generalist AI (GPT-4o), and a reasoning AI (o3) for complex dermatology cases. Human experts rated peer-generated plans higher than AI plans, while a superior AI judge favored AI plans over human-generated ones. This disparity highlights the subjective nature of evaluating clinical plans and the gap between experience-based heuristics and data-driven logic. The reasoning AI model, o3, outperformed both human experts and the generalist AI in the AI judge's evaluation, emphasizing the need for synergistic human-AI systems for optimal clinical care. The findings suggest the importance of bridging the gap between human experience and AI logic to enhance the integration of AI in healthcare.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.05716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Evaluating AI-generated treatment plans is a key challenge as AI expands beyond diagnostics, especially with new reasoning models. This study compares plans from human experts and two AI models (a generalist and a reasoner), assessed by both human peers and a superior AI judge.
  Methods: Ten dermatologists, a generalist AI (GPT-4o), and a reasoning AI (o3) generated treatment plans for five complex dermatology cases. The anonymized, normalized plans were scored in two phases: 1) by the ten human experts, and 2) by a superior AI judge (Gemini 2.5 Pro) using an identical rubric.
  Results: A profound 'evaluator effect' was observed. Human experts scored peer-generated plans significantly higher than AI plans (mean 7.62 vs. 7.16; p=0.0313), ranking GPT-4o 6th (mean 7.38) and the reasoning model, o3, 11th (mean 6.97). Conversely, the AI judge produced a complete inversion, scoring AI plans significantly higher than human plans (mean 7.75 vs. 6.79; p=0.0313). It ranked o3 1st (mean 8.20) and GPT-4o 2nd, placing all human experts lower.
  Conclusions: The perceived quality of a clinical plan is fundamentally dependent on the evaluator's nature. An advanced reasoning AI, ranked poorly by human experts, was judged as superior by a sophisticated AI, revealing a deep gap between experience-based clinical heuristics and data-driven algorithmic logic. This paradox presents a critical challenge for AI integration, suggesting the future requires synergistic, explainable human-AI systems that bridge this reasoning gap to augment clinical care.

<div> Keywords: AI models, clinical practice, distribution shift, ModelAuditor, real-world variations <br />
Summary: 
The deployment of AI models in clinical settings can lead to catastrophic failures due to real-world variations. ModelAuditor, a self-reflective agent, aims to address this challenge by simulating context-specific distribution shifts and providing interpretable reports on potential failure modes and mitigation strategies. It effectively identifies failure modes in scenarios like histopathology variations, demographic shifts in dermatology, and equipment differences in chest radiography. By implementing targeted recommendations, ModelAuditor can recover a significant portion of performance lost under distribution shifts, surpassing baseline models and state-of-the-art augmentation techniques. The system's multi-agent architecture enables efficient auditing on consumer hardware in a cost-effective manner. Overall, ModelAuditor offers a promising solution to enhance the reliability of AI models in clinical practice. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.05755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of AI models in clinical practice faces a critical challenge: models achieving expert-level performance on benchmarks can fail catastrophically when confronted with real-world variations in medical imaging. Minor shifts in scanner hardware, lighting or demographics can erode accuracy, but currently reliability auditing to identify such catastrophic failure cases before deployment is a bespoke and time-consuming process. Practitioners lack accessible and interpretable tools to expose and repair hidden failure modes. Here we introduce ModelAuditor, a self-reflective agent that converses with users, selects task-specific metrics, and simulates context-dependent, clinically relevant distribution shifts. ModelAuditor then generates interpretable reports explaining how much performance likely degrades during deployment, discussing specific likely failure modes and identifying root causes and mitigation strategies. Our comprehensive evaluation across three real-world clinical scenarios - inter-institutional variation in histopathology, demographic shifts in dermatology, and equipment heterogeneity in chest radiography - demonstrates that ModelAuditor is able correctly identify context-specific failure modes of state-of-the-art models such as the established SIIM-ISIC melanoma classifier. Its targeted recommendations recover 15-25% of performance lost under real-world distribution shift, substantially outperforming both baseline models and state-of-the-art augmentation methods. These improvements are achieved through a multi-agent architecture and execute on consumer hardware in under 10 minutes, costing less than US$0.50 per audit.

<div> Keywords: battery health monitoring, microgrids, real-time analysis, equivalent electrical model, battery management systems

Summary:
Real-time monitoring of battery health in microgrids faces challenges due to operational constraints. The innovative approach proposed in the 4BLife project involves analyzing discharge pulses at the end of the charge phase to estimate the state of health (SoH) of batteries. By examining the equivalent electrical model parameters during the current pulse, SoH can be predicted. Initial experimental results show the method's effectiveness, with successful predictions of battery degradation with a mean absolute error of around 1%. The explainability score of the estimator is high at 0.9. If confirmed, this method could be seamlessly integrated into battery management systems (BMS) for optimized continuous operation. <div>

Abstract: Real-time monitoring of the state of health (SoH) of batteries remains a major challenge, particularly in microgrids where operational constraints limit the use of traditional methods. As part of the 4BLife project, we propose an innovative method based on the analysis of a discharge pulse at the end of the charge phase. The parameters of the equivalent electrical model describing the voltage evolution across the battery terminals during this current pulse are then used to estimate the SoH. Based on the experimental data acquired so far, the initial results demonstrate the relevance of the proposed approach. After training using the parameters of two batteries with a capacity degradation of around 85%, we successfully predicted the degradation of two other batteries, cycled down to approximately 90% SoH, with a mean absolute error of around 1% in the worst case, and an explainability score of the estimator close to 0.9. If these performances are confirmed, this method can be easily integrated into battery management systems (BMS) and paves the way for optimized battery management under continuous operation.

<div> agent, GUI, task planning, visual grounding, test-time scaling 

Summary:
This paper presents GTA1, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) Test-time Scaling Agent that addresses challenges in task planning and visual grounding. To tackle task planning ambiguity, a test-time scaling method is introduced to select the most appropriate action proposal by sampling multiple candidates and using a judge model. This method improves decision quality and overall performance. In terms of visual grounding, a model leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) is proposed to enhance accuracy in interacting with visual elements. Experiment results show that GTA1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks. For instance, GTA1-7B achieves high accuracies on Screenspot-Pro, Screenspot-V2, and OSWorld-G datasets. When combined with a planner using the test-time scaling strategy, GTA1 exhibits state-of-the-art agentic performance. The code and models are open-sourced for further research and development. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.05791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents autonomously operate across platforms (e.g., Linux) to complete tasks by interacting with visual elements. Specifically, a user instruction is decomposed into a sequence of action proposals, each corresponding to an interaction with the GUI. After each action, the agent observes the updated GUI environment to plan the next step. However, two main challenges arise: i) resolving ambiguity in task planning (i.e., the action proposal sequence), where selecting an appropriate plan is non-trivial, as many valid ones may exist; ii) accurately grounding actions in complex and high-resolution interfaces, i.e., precisely interacting with visual targets.
  This paper investigates the two aforementioned challenges with our GUI Test-time Scaling Agent, namely GTA1. First, to select the most appropriate action proposal, we introduce a test-time scaling method. At each step, we sample multiple candidate action proposals and leverage a judge model to evaluate and select the most suitable one. It trades off computation for better decision quality by concurrent sampling, shortening task execution steps, and improving overall performance. Second, we propose a model that achieves improved accuracy when grounding the selected action proposal to its corresponding visual elements. Our key insight is that reinforcement learning (RL) facilitates visual grounding through inherent objective alignments, rewarding successful clicks on interface elements.
  Experimentally, our method establishes state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks. For example, GTA1-7B achieves 50.1%, 92.4%, and 67.7% accuracies on Screenspot-Pro, Screenspot-V2, and OSWorld-G, respectively. When paired with a planner applying our test-time scaling strategy, it exhibits state-of-the-art agentic performance (e.g., 45.2% task success rate on OSWorld). We open-source our code and models here.

<title>Affective-ROPTester: Capability and Bias Analysis of LLMs in Predicting Retinopathy of Prematurity</title>

<div> Keywords: ROP risk prediction, large language models, Chinese benchmark dataset, affective biases, automated evaluation framework <br />
Summary: 
- Large language models have limited efficacy in predicting retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) risk without external medical knowledge but perform better with structured inputs.
- Affective biases are present in the model outputs, with a tendency to overestimate medium- and high-risk cases.
- Positive emotional framing helps mitigate predictive bias compared to negative emotions.
- The study emphasizes the importance of affect-sensitive prompt engineering in improving diagnostic reliability.
- The Affective-ROPTester framework proves useful in evaluating and addressing affective bias in clinical language modeling systems. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.05816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs) across various domains, their capacity to predict retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) risk remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel Chinese benchmark dataset, termed CROP, comprising 993 admission records annotated with low, medium, and high-risk labels. To systematically examine the predictive capabilities and affective biases of LLMs in ROP risk stratification, we propose Affective-ROPTester, an automated evaluation framework incorporating three prompting strategies: Instruction-based, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and In-Context Learning (ICL). The Instruction scheme assesses LLMs' intrinsic knowledge and associated biases, whereas the CoT and ICL schemes leverage external medical knowledge to enhance predictive accuracy. Crucially, we integrate emotional elements at the prompt level to investigate how different affective framings influence the model's ability to predict ROP and its bias patterns. Empirical results derived from the CROP dataset yield two principal observations. First, LLMs demonstrate limited efficacy in ROP risk prediction when operating solely on intrinsic knowledge, yet exhibit marked performance gains when augmented with structured external inputs. Second, affective biases are evident in the model outputs, with a consistent inclination toward overestimating medium- and high-risk cases. Third, compared to negative emotions, positive emotional framing contributes to mitigating predictive bias in model outputs. These findings highlight the critical role of affect-sensitive prompt engineering in enhancing diagnostic reliability and emphasize the utility of Affective-ROPTester as a framework for evaluating and mitigating affective bias in clinical language modeling systems.

It highlights the importance of pattern-based and intuitive decision-making processes observed in human cognition that are lacking in AI systems. The paper reviews insights from cognitive psychology and previous attempts to model human-like behavior in artificial agents. It discusses the relevance of these findings to General Game Playing (GGP) and introduces a work-in-progress model called CogniPlay that aims to incorporate human-like decision-making processes.

Abstract: While AI systems have equaled or surpassed human performance in a wide variety of games such as Chess, Go, or Dota 2, describing these systems as truly "human-like" remains far-fetched. Despite their success, they fail to replicate the pattern-based, intuitive decision-making processes observed in human cognition. This paper presents an overview of findings from cognitive psychology and previous efforts to model human-like behavior in artificial agents, discusses their applicability to General Game Playing (GGP) and introduces our work-in-progress model based on these observations: CogniPlay.

Summary:
Neurosymbolic Transition Systems propose a computational model that combines symbolic algorithms with Large Language Models (LLMs) to build Automated Reasoning (AR) tools. The current ad hoc programming model lacks strong guarantees and efficient synchronization of neural networks and symbolic reasoning. The new paradigm pairs symbolic state with intuition, allowing state transitions to operate over symbols and intuition simultaneously. This approach aims to scale logical reasoning beyond current capabilities while retaining the robust guarantees of symbolic algorithms. By reifying this model in a logic programming language, neurosymbolic AR tools can potentially unlock the full potential of LLM-powered reasoning. <div>

Abstract: There is growing excitement about building software verifiers, synthesizers, and other Automated Reasoning (AR) tools by combining traditional symbolic algorithms and Large Language Models (LLMs). Unfortunately, the current practice for constructing such neurosymbolic AR systems is an ad hoc programming model that does not have the strong guarantees of traditional symbolic algorithms, nor a deep enough synchronization of neural networks and symbolic reasoning to unlock the full potential of LLM-powered reasoning. I propose Neurosymbolic Transition Systems as a principled computational model that can underlie infrastructure for building neurosymbolic AR tools. In this model, symbolic state is paired with intuition, and state transitions operate over symbols and intuition in parallel. I argue why this new paradigm can scale logical reasoning beyond current capabilities while retaining the strong guarantees of symbolic algorithms, and I sketch out how the computational model I propose can be reified in a logic programming language.

Abstract: With the advent of Transformers, time series forecasting has seen significant advances, yet it remains challenging due to the need for effective sequence representation, memory construction, and accurate target projection. Time series forecasting remains a challenging task, demanding effective sequence representation, meaningful information extraction, and precise future projection. Each dataset and forecasting configuration constitutes a distinct task, each posing unique challenges the model must overcome to produce accurate predictions. To systematically address these task-specific difficulties, this work decomposes the time series forecasting pipeline into three core stages: input sequence representation, information extraction and memory construction, and final target projection. Within each stage, we investigate a range of architectural configurations to assess the effectiveness of various modules, such as convolutional layers for feature extraction and self-attention mechanisms for information extraction, across diverse forecasting tasks, including evaluations on seven benchmark datasets. Our models achieve state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy while greatly enhancing computational efficiency, with reduced training and inference times and a lower parameter count.

Humans often imagine scenes when listening to music, and this paper explores whether a Music Language Model can perform a similar task called Music Scene Imagination (MSI). The researchers introduce MusiScene, a music captioning model that considers both video and music data to imagine scenes that complement the music.

Evaluation shows that MusiScene outperforms existing models in generating contextually relevant captions.

Abstract: Humans can imagine various atmospheres and settings when listening to music, envisioning movie scenes that complement each piece. For example, slow, melancholic music might evoke scenes of heartbreak, while upbeat melodies suggest celebration. This paper explores whether a Music Language Model, e.g. MU-LLaMA, can perform a similar task, called Music Scene Imagination (MSI), which requires cross-modal information from video and music to train. To improve upon existing music captioning models which focusing solely on musical elements, we introduce MusiScene, a music captioning model designed to imagine scenes that complement each music. In this paper, (1) we construct a large-scale video-audio caption dataset with 3,371 pairs, (2) we finetune Music Understanding LLaMA for the MSI task to create MusiScene, and (3) we conduct comprehensive evaluations and prove that our MusiScene is more capable of generating contextually relevant captions compared to MU-LLaMA. We leverage the generated MSI captions to enhance Video Background Music Generation (VBMG) from text.

Summary:
In the realm of mobile communication networks, accurately predicting key system parameters like channel state information, user location, and network traffic is crucial for different tasks at the physical and medium access control layers. Traditional deep learning methods have had limitations in generalizing across scenarios and tasks. To address this, a unified foundation model for multi-task prediction in wireless networks is proposed. This model supports various prediction intervals, enforces univariate decomposition to unify tasks, introduces granularity for interval awareness, and utilizes a causal Transformer backbone for precise predictions. Additionally, a patch masking strategy during training is employed to accommodate arbitrary input lengths. Trained on extensive datasets, the model exhibits strong generalization to new scenarios and outperforms traditional baselines in zero-shot performance for new tasks. <div>

Abstract: With the growing complexity and dynamics of the mobile communication networks, accurately predicting key system parameters, such as channel state information (CSI), user location, and network traffic, has become essential for a wide range of physical (PHY)-layer and medium access control (MAC)-layer tasks. Although traditional deep learning (DL)-based methods have been widely applied to such prediction tasks, they often struggle to generalize across different scenarios and tasks. In response, we propose a unified foundation model for multi-task prediction in wireless networks that supports diverse prediction intervals. The proposed model enforces univariate decomposition to unify heterogeneous tasks, encodes granularity for interval awareness, and uses a causal Transformer backbone for accurate predictions. Additionally, we introduce a patch masking strategy during training to support arbitrary input lengths. After trained on large-scale datasets, the proposed foundation model demonstrates strong generalization to unseen scenarios and achieves zero-shot performance on new tasks that surpass traditional full-shot baselines.

Abstract: The lack of transparency of data-driven Artificial Intelligence techniques limits their interpretability and acceptance into healthcare decision-making processes. We propose an attribution-based approach to improve the interpretability of Explainable AI-based predictions in the specific context of arm lymphedema's risk assessment after lymph nodal radiotherapy in breast cancer. The proposed method performs a statistical analysis of the attributes in the rule-based prediction model using standard metrics from Information Retrieval techniques. This analysis computes the relevance of each attribute to the prediction and provides users with interpretable information about the impact of risk factors. The results of a user study that compared the output generated by the proposed approach with the raw output of the Explainable AI model suggested higher levels of interpretability and usefulness in the context of predicting lymphedema risk.

Summary: HopeBot, a chatbot using a large language model, administers the PHQ-9 for depression screening with strong agreement with self-administered scores. Participants reported greater trust in the chatbot due to clearer structure, interpretive guidance, and a supportive tone. Ratings for comfort, voice clarity, handling sensitive topics, and recommendation helpfulness were generally positive. Recommendation helpfulness varied by employment status and prior mental-health service use. Overall, participants expressed high willingness to reuse or recommend the chatbot. These findings suggest that voice-based large language model chatbots like HopeBot can be effective adjuncts for routine depression screening, offering scalability and low burden. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Static tools like the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) effectively screen depression but lack interactivity and adaptability. We developed HopeBot, a chatbot powered by a large language model (LLM) that administers the PHQ-9 using retrieval-augmented generation and real-time clarification. In a within-subject study, 132 adults in the United Kingdom and China completed both self-administered and chatbot versions. Scores demonstrated strong agreement (ICC = 0.91; 45% identical). Among 75 participants providing comparative feedback, 71% reported greater trust in the chatbot, highlighting clearer structure, interpretive guidance, and a supportive tone. Mean ratings (0-10) were 8.4 for comfort, 7.7 for voice clarity, 7.6 for handling sensitive topics, and 7.4 for recommendation helpfulness; the latter varied significantly by employment status and prior mental-health service use (p < 0.05). Overall, 87.1% expressed willingness to reuse or recommend HopeBot. These findings demonstrate voice-based LLM chatbots can feasibly serve as scalable, low-burden adjuncts for routine depression screening.

<div> Keywords: Text-to-SQL, reinforcement learning, execution accuracy, scalable, interpretable 

Summary: 
CogniSQL-R1-Zero is a reinforcement learning framework that excels in generating accurate SQL queries from natural language inputs. It outperforms previous supervised baselines on the Text2SQL benchmark by focusing on execution correctness and format-tag compliance without complex reward shaping. The model achieves state-of-the-art results using a smaller 7B backbone and minimal resources, showing scalability and efficiency. Two new datasets have been released to support further research in efficient and interpretable Text-to-SQL modeling, including reasoning traces with varying contexts and a corpus of weakly supervised queries annotated with diverse reasoning paths. Overall, the study showcases the success of an RL-based approach in producing executable SQL queries from natural language inputs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.06013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL) remains a core challenge at the intersection of language understanding and structured data access. Although large language models (LLMs) have improved fluency, generating correct and executable SQL, especially for complex queries, continues to be challenging. We introduce CogniSQL-R1-Zero, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework and model that produces accurate SQL using a lightweight reward signal based on execution correctness and format-tag compliance. By avoiding intermediate supervision, hybrid pipelines and complex reward shaping, our method encourages stable learning and stronger alignment with the ultimate task objective-producing executable programs. CogniSQL-R1-Zero achieves state-of-the-art execution accuracy on Text2SQL benchmark; BIRD bench, outperforming prior supervised and instruction-tuned baselines including SFT CodeS-7B, DeepSeek-Coder 236B, and Mistral 123B-despite being trained on a significantly smaller 7B backbone. This result underscores the scalability and efficiency of our RL-based approach when trained on just four NVIDIA A100 GPUs (40 GB VRAM each). To support further research in efficient and interpretable Text-to-SQL modeling, we release two curated datasets: (i) a collection of 5,024 reasoning traces with varying context lengths, and (ii) a positive-sampled corpus of 36,356 corpus of weakly supervised queries, each annotated with six semantically diverse reasoning paths. Together, these contributions advance scalable, execution-aligned Text-to-SQL generation.

<div> Neighbor Selection, Explainable AI, Interpretability, Feature Importance, User Study
Summary: 
Feature-Guided Neighbor Selection (FGNS) is introduced as a post hoc method to enhance the interpretability of AI models for users without domain expertise. In a user study focusing on Kannada script classifications, FGNS significantly improved non-experts' ability to identify model errors while maintaining agreement with correct predictions. Participants using FGNS made faster and more accurate decisions compared to traditional k-NN explanations. Quantitative analysis revealed that FGNS selects neighbors based on class characteristics rather than solely minimizing feature-space distance, resulting in more consistent selection and tighter clustering around class prototypes. These findings suggest that FGNS is a promising approach for more human-aligned model assessment, although further research is needed to bridge the gap between explanation quality and perceived trust.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) methods often struggle to generate clear, interpretable outputs for users without domain expertise. We introduce Feature-Guided Neighbor Selection (FGNS), a post hoc method that enhances interpretability by selecting class-representative examples using both local and global feature importance. In a user study (N = 98) evaluating Kannada script classifications, FGNS significantly improved non-experts' ability to identify model errors while maintaining appropriate agreement with correct predictions. Participants made faster and more accurate decisions compared to those given traditional k-NN explanations. Quantitative analysis shows that FGNS selects neighbors that better reflect class characteristics rather than merely minimizing feature-space distance, leading to more consistent selection and tighter clustering around class prototypes. These results support FGNS as a step toward more human-aligned model assessment, although further work is needed to address the gap between explanation quality and perceived trust.

<div> belief sets, Lockean thesis, probabilistic terms, logical deduction, belief change theory

Summary: 
The paper discusses belief sets within the framework of the Lockean thesis, defining them in terms of degrees of confidence expressed probabilistically. While the Lockean belief sets are not usually closed under classical logical deduction, the paper aims to provide two characterizations of belief sets that are deductively closed under classical logic. Additionally, the paper proposes an approach to probabilistic update that allows for minimal revision of beliefs when new information is introduced. This minimal revision involves making the fewest changes to the existing belief set while accommodating the new information. Through this approach, the paper demonstrates how a belief set can be deductively closed via minimal revision, addressing the limitations of Lockean belief sets and offering a more nuanced perspective on belief change theory. <div>

Abstract: Within the formal setting of the Lockean thesis, an agent belief set is defined in terms of degrees of confidence and these are described in probabilistic terms. This approach is of established interest, notwithstanding some limitations that make its use troublesome in some contexts, like, for instance, in belief change theory. Precisely, Lockean belief sets are not generally closed under (classical) logical deduction. The aim of the present paper is twofold: on one side we provide two characterizations of those belief sets that are closed under classical logic deduction, and on the other we propose an approach to probabilistic update that allows us for a minimal revision of those beliefs, i.e., a revision obtained by making the fewest possible changes to the existing belief set while still accommodating the new information. In particular, we show how we can deductively close a belief set via a minimal revision.

<div> advancements, large language models, financial domain, FEVO framework, state-of-the-art performance
<br />
Summary:
The paper introduces FEVO (Financial Evolution), a framework designed to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) in the financial domain. FEVO employs a multi-stage approach, including continued pre-training (CPT), supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning (RL), to expand financial domain knowledge and develop structured reasoning patterns. The framework leverages high-quality datasets and frontier reasoning models to train the FEVO series of models, including C32B, S32B, and R32B. Evaluation on seven benchmarks demonstrates that FEVO-R32B achieves state-of-the-art performance on five financial benchmarks, outperforming larger and specialist models. The comparison with FEVO-R32B-0, trained solely with RL, highlights the importance of integrating financial domain knowledge and structured reasoning for improved performance in the financial domain. <div>
arXiv:2507.06057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in reasoning for large language models (LLMs) have lead to significant performance improvements for LLMs in various fields such as mathematics and programming. However, research applying these advances to the financial domain, where considerable domain-specific knowledge is necessary to complete tasks, remains limited. To address this gap, we introduce FEVO (Financial Evolution), a multi-stage enhancement framework developed to enhance LLM performance in the financial domain. FEVO systemically enhances LLM performance by using continued pre-training (CPT) to expand financial domain knowledge, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill structured, elaborate reasoning patterns, and reinforcement learning (RL) to further integrate the expanded financial domain knowledge with the learned structured reasoning. To ensure effective and efficient training, we leverage frontier reasoning models and rule-based filtering to curate FEVO-Train, high-quality datasets specifically designed for the different post-training phases. Using our framework, we train the FEVO series of models -- C32B, S32B, R32B -- from Qwen2.5-32B and evaluate them on seven benchmarks to assess financial and general capabilities, with results showing that FEVO-R32B achieves state-of-the-art performance on five financial benchmarks against much larger models as well as specialist models. More significantly, FEVO-R32B demonstrates markedly better performance than FEVO-R32B-0 (trained from Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct using only RL), thus validating the effectiveness of financial domain knowledge expansion and structured, logical reasoning distillation

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.06077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper tackles the urgent need for efficient energy management in healthcare facilities, where fluctuating demands challenge operational efficiency and sustainability. Traditional methods often prove inadequate, causing inefficiencies and higher costs. To address this, the study presents an AI-based framework combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), genetic algorithm (GA), and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations), specifically designed for healthcare energy management. Although LSTM is widely used for time-series forecasting, its application in healthcare energy prediction remains underexplored. The results reveal that LSTM significantly outperforms ARIMA and Prophet models in forecasting complex, non-linear demand patterns. LSTM achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 21.69 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 29.96, far better than Prophet (MAE: 59.78, RMSE: 81.22) and ARIMA (MAE: 87.73, RMSE: 125.22), demonstrating superior performance. The genetic algorithm is applied to optimize model parameters and improve load balancing strategies, enabling adaptive responses to real-time energy fluctuations. SHAP analysis further enhances model transparency by explaining the influence of different features on predictions, fostering trust in decision-making processes. This integrated LSTM-GA-SHAP approach offers a robust solution for improving forecasting accuracy, boosting energy efficiency, and advancing sustainability in healthcare facilities. Future research may explore real-time deployment and hybridization with reinforcement learning for continuous optimization. Overall, the study establishes a solid foundation for using AI in healthcare energy management, highlighting its scalability, efficiency, and resilience potential.

Summary: 
The article introduces OpenAgentSafety, a framework designed to evaluate the behavior of AI agents across various risk categories in real-world settings. Unlike previous benchmarks, OpenAgentSafety assesses agent behavior using real tools such as web browsers, code execution environments, and messaging platforms across a wide range of tasks. The framework supports over 350 tasks, including both benign and adversarial user intents, making it comprehensive and versatile. OpenAgentSafety combines rule-based analysis with LLM (Large Language Models)-as-judge assessments to detect unsafe behaviors, both overt and subtle. Empirical analysis on five prominent LLMs reveals high rates of unsafe behavior in safety-vulnerable tasks, emphasizing the importance of stronger safeguards before deploying AI agents in real-world scenarios.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.06134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in AI agents capable of solving complex, everyday tasks, from scheduling to customer service, have enabled deployment in real-world settings, but their possibilities for unsafe behavior demands rigorous evaluation. While prior benchmarks have attempted to assess agent safety, most fall short by relying on simulated environments, narrow task domains, or unrealistic tool abstractions. We introduce OpenAgentSafety, a comprehensive and modular framework for evaluating agent behavior across eight critical risk categories. Unlike prior work, our framework evaluates agents that interact with real tools, including web browsers, code execution environments, file systems, bash shells, and messaging platforms; and supports over 350 multi-turn, multi-user tasks spanning both benign and adversarial user intents. OpenAgentSafety is designed for extensibility, allowing researchers to add tools, tasks, websites, and adversarial strategies with minimal effort. It combines rule-based analysis with LLM-as-judge assessments to detect both overt and subtle unsafe behaviors. Empirical analysis of five prominent LLMs in agentic scenarios reveals unsafe behavior in 51.2% of safety-vulnerable tasks with Claude-Sonnet-3.7, to 72.7% with o3-mini, highlighting critical safety vulnerabilities and the need for stronger safeguards before real-world deployment.

<title>The Delta Learning Hypothesis: Preference Tuning on Weak Data can Yield Strong Gains</title>

<div> supervised learning, language models, preference data, delta learning hypothesis, post-training
Summary:<br />
- The quality of language models is often improved by enhancing the training data, especially in the absence of strong supervision.
- Paired preference data comprising weak individual data points can lead to significant improvements in model performance beyond the capabilities of each data point alone.
- The delta learning hypothesis suggests that the relative quality difference between data points is adequate to drive learning through preference tuning, even when supervised fine-tuning on weak data is counterproductive.
- Experimental validation demonstrates that post-training models on paired preference data can match the performance of models tuned from the same base with stronger supervisors.
- Research in logistic regression supports the idea that the performance gap between weak teacher models can provide valuable signals for enhancing a stronger student model. <div>
arXiv:2507.06187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improvements in language models are often driven by improving the quality of the data we train them on, which can be limiting when strong supervision is scarce. In this work, we show that paired preference data consisting of individually weak data points can enable gains beyond the strength of each individual data point. We formulate the delta learning hypothesis to explain this phenomenon, positing that the relative quality delta between points suffices to drive learning via preference tuning--even when supervised finetuning on the weak data hurts. We validate our hypothesis in controlled experiments and at scale, where we post-train 8B models on preference data generated by pairing a small 3B model's responses with outputs from an even smaller 1.5B model to create a meaningful delta. Strikingly, on a standard 11-benchmark evaluation suite (MATH, MMLU, etc.), our simple recipe matches the performance of Tulu 3, a state-of-the-art open model tuned from the same base model while relying on much stronger supervisors (e.g., GPT-4o). Thus, delta learning enables simpler and cheaper open recipes for state-of-the-art post-training. To better understand delta learning, we prove in logistic regression that the performance gap between two weak teacher models provides useful signal for improving a stronger student. Overall, our work shows that models can learn surprisingly well from paired data that might typically be considered weak.

The article discusses the use of causal abstractions for identifying treatment effects from observational data in the absence of fully specified causal diagrams. It introduces and formalizes identifiability criteria for causal queries within collections of causal diagrams. The main contribution is the organization of these criteria into a structured hierarchy, showcasing their relationships and clarifying what can be identified with varying levels of causal knowledge. The framework is illustrated through examples and provides tools for reasoning about identifiability when full causal information is unavailable. <div>
arXiv:2507.06213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the effect of a treatment from observational data typically requires assuming a fully specified causal diagram. However, such diagrams are rarely known in practice, especially in complex or high-dimensional settings. To overcome this limitation, recent works have explored the use of causal abstractions-simplified representations that retain partial causal information. In this paper, we consider causal abstractions formalized as collections of causal diagrams, and focus on the identifiability of causal queries within such collections. We introduce and formalize several identifiability criteria under this setting. Our main contribution is to organize these criteria into a structured hierarchy, highlighting their relationships. This hierarchical view enables a clearer understanding of what can be identified under varying levels of causal knowledge. We illustrate our framework through examples from the literature and provide tools to reason about identifiability when full causal knowledge is unavailable.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces scoring rules for eliciting probabilistic predictions from a strategic agent. It discusses proper scoring rules that incentivize agents to report their true beliefs. Wu and Hartline (2024) developed a reduction from textual to numerical information elicitation, ensuring properness for textual elicitation. However, not all proper scoring rules align well with human preferences in text evaluation. The paper proposes the Aligned Scoring rule (ASR) for text, optimizing alignment with human scores while maintaining properness. Experimental results demonstrate that ASR outperforms previous methods in aligning with human preferences. <div>
arXiv:2507.06221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scoring rules elicit probabilistic predictions from a strategic agent by scoring the prediction against a ground truth state. A scoring rule is proper if, from the agent's perspective, reporting the true belief maximizes the expected score. With the development of language models, Wu and Hartline (2024) proposes a reduction from textual information elicitation to the numerical (i.e. probabilistic) information elicitation problem, which achieves provable properness for textual elicitation. However, not all proper scoring rules are well aligned with human preference over text. Our paper designs the Aligned Scoring rule (ASR) for text by optimizing and minimizing the mean squared error between a proper scoring rule and a reference score (e.g. human score). Our experiments show that our ASR outperforms previous methods in aligning with human preference while maintaining properness.

Summary: 
The article discusses the integration of AI systems into military decision-making processes and highlights the role of integrators in mediating between developers and users. It conceptualizes the relationship between different groups and AI systems as a sociotechnical system, emphasizing the challenges that arise in resort-to-force decision-making. These challenges include technological limitations, the role of integrators, and human-machine interaction issues. The recommendations provided address the shortcomings in integrating AI systems into resort-to-force decision-making structures, focusing on improving understanding among different groups and enhancing collaboration in complex human-machine configurations. The importance of addressing these challenges is underscored to ensure effective decision-making and ethical use of AI technologies in military contexts.<br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2501.06861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of AI systems into the military domain is changing the way war-related decisions are made. It binds together three disparate groups of actors - developers, integrators, users - and creates a relationship between these groups and the machine, embedded in the (pre-)existing organisational and system structures. In this article, we focus on the important, but often neglected, group of integrators within such a sociotechnical system. In complex human-machine configurations, integrators carry responsibility for linking the disparate groups of developers and users in the political and military system. To act as the mediating group requires a deep understanding of the other groups' activities, perspectives and norms. We thus ask which challenges and shortcomings emerge from integrating AI systems into resort-to-force (RTF) decision-making processes, and how to address them. To answer this, we proceed in three steps. First, we conceptualise the relationship between different groups of actors and AI systems as a sociotechnical system. Second, we identify challenges within such systems for human-machine teaming in RTF decisions. We focus on challenges that arise a) from the technology itself, b) from the integrators' role in the sociotechnical system, c) from the human-machine interaction. Third, we provide policy recommendations to address these shortcomings when integrating AI systems into RTF decision-making structures.

Summary:
The manuscript examines Human-in-the-loop (HITL) setups for AI from a legal and safety perspective. It introduces oracle machines to formalize various HITL setups, illustrating the trade-off between legal responsibility and technical explainability. A taxonomy of HITL failure modes is presented, highlighting limitations in achieving desired outcomes. The study identifies oversights in UK and EU legal frameworks, proposing the recognition of different HITL setups' effectiveness and responsibility assignment. It emphasizes the need to avoid human "scapegoating" and discusses the technical design decisions and potential failures in HITL setups. The analysis sheds light on challenges in creating HITL setups, offering insights for AI developers and lawmakers. <div>

Abstract: The legal compliance and safety of different Human-in-the-loop (HITL) setups for AI can vary greatly. This manuscript aims to identify new ways of choosing between such setups, and shows that there is an unavoidable trade-off between the attribution of legal responsibility and the technical explainability of AI. We begin by using the notion of oracle machines from computability theory to formalise different HITL setups, distinguishing between trivial human monitoring, single endpoint human action, and highly involved interaction between the human(s) and the AI. These correspond to total functions, many-one reductions, and Turing reductions respectively. A taxonomy categorising HITL failure modes is then presented, highlighting the limitations on what any HITL setup can actually achieve. Our approach then identifies oversights from UK and EU legal frameworks, which focus on certain HITL setups which may not always achieve the desired ethical, legal, and sociotechnical outcomes. We suggest areas where the law should recognise the effectiveness of different HITL setups and assign responsibility in these contexts, avoiding unnecessary and unproductive human "scapegoating". Overall, we show how HITL setups involve many technical design decisions, and can be prone to failures which are often out of the humans' control. This opens up a new analytic perspective on the challenges arising in the creation of HITL setups, helping inform AI developers and lawmakers on designing HITL to better achieve their desired outcomes.

Summary:
The article discusses the risks that arise from the interactions of AI and autonomous algorithmic systems, especially when they operate without awareness of each other or their full ecosystem. These interactions can cause unforeseen negative outcomes, surpassing human monitoring and legal intervention capabilities. Current governance frameworks lack visibility into these complex interactions. The proposed solutions include increasing transparency and accountability through phased system registration, a licensing framework for deployment, and enhanced monitoring capabilities. The focus is on addressing the complexity of interactions and ensuring proper oversight to mitigate potential risks and ensure the responsible deployment of algorithmic systems. <div>
arXiv:2505.20181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and other autonomous algorithmic systems presents the world with new systemic risks. While focus often lies on the function of individual algorithms, a critical and underestimated danger arises from their interactions, particularly when algorithmic systems operate without awareness of each other, or when those deploying them are unaware of the full algorithmic ecosystem deployment is occurring in. These interactions can lead to unforeseen, rapidly escalating negative outcomes - from market crashes and energy supply disruptions to potential physical accidents and erosion of public trust - often exceeding the human capacity for effective monitoring and the legal capacities for proper intervention. Current governance frameworks are inadequate as they lack visibility into this complex ecosystem of interactions. This paper outlines the nature of this challenge and proposes some initial policy suggestions centered on increasing transparency and accountability through phased system registration, a licensing framework for deployment, and enhanced monitoring capabilities.

Summary: 
The study examines the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in assisting with the adaptation of visualization examples to new datasets. The process of manually adapting code examples can be time-consuming and challenging, requiring familiarity with both the existing code implementation and the new dataset. The researchers evaluate the performance of LLM assistance across different datasets and charts, categorizing failures based on type and severity. Two approaches are compared: direct code generation and adaptation by the LLM model, and a more constrained program synthesis pipeline where the LLM provides structural information. Both approaches face challenges when new data needs significant transformation. Important design recommendations are discussed for future retargeting systems, highlighting the need for proper data transformation processes to improve the effectiveness of LLM assistance in code adaptation.

Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of visualization examples published on the web, retargeting existing custom chart implementations to new datasets remains difficult, time-intensive, and tedious. The adaptation process assumes author familiarity with both the implementation of the example as well as how the new dataset might need to be transformed to fit into the example code. With recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), automatic adaptation of code can be achieved from high-level user prompts, reducing the barrier for visualization retargeting. To better understand how LLMs can assist retargeting and its potential limitations, we characterize and evaluate the performance of LLM assistance across multiple datasets and charts of varying complexity, categorizing failures according to type and severity. In our evaluation, we compare two approaches: (1) directly instructing the LLM model to fully generate and adapt code by treating code as text inputs and (2) a more constrained program synthesis pipeline where the LLM guides the code construction process by providing structural information (e.g., visual encodings) based on properties of the example code and data. We find that both approaches struggle when new data has not been appropriately transformed, and discuss important design recommendations for future retargeting systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in domains such as mathematics and programming, yet their capabilities in physics remain underexplored and poorly understood. Physics poses unique challenges that demand not only precise computation but also deep conceptual understanding and physical modeling skills. Existing benchmarks often fall short due to limited difficulty, multiple-choice formats, and static evaluation settings that fail to capture physical modeling ability. In this paper, we introduce ABench-Physics, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LLMs' physical reasoning and generalization capabilities. ABench-Physics consists of two components: Phy_A, a static set of 400 graduate- or Olympiad-level problems; and Phy_B, a dynamic subset of 100 problems equipped with an automatic variation engine to test model robustness across changing conditions. All questions require precise numerical answers, with strict formatting and tolerance constraints. Our evaluation of several state-of-the-art LLMs reveals substantial performance gaps, highlighting persistent limitations in physical reasoning, especially in generalization to dynamic variants. ABench-Physics provides a challenging and diagnostic framework for advancing scientific reasoning in LLMs.

Summary: 
This paper explores the phenomenon of over-smoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as network depth increases. The authors draw parallels between over-smoothing in GNNs and Anderson localization in disordered systems, particularly in terms of homogenization of node features and loss of distinctiveness. They introduce participation degree as a metric to quantify over-smoothing, highlighting the expansion of low-frequency modes and localization of high-frequency modes. The paper proposes that reducing disorder in information propagation could alleviate over-smoothing in GNNs. The theoretical analysis conducted sheds light on the potential connection between Anderson localization behavior and over-smoothing in GNNs. <div>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great potential in graph data analysis due to their powerful representation capabilities. However, as the network depth increases, the issue of over-smoothing becomes more severe, causing node representations to lose their distinctiveness. This paper analyzes the mechanism of over-smoothing through the analogy to Anderson localization and introduces participation degree as a metric to quantify this phenomenon. Specifically, as the depth of the GNN increases, node features homogenize after multiple layers of message passing, leading to a loss of distinctiveness, similar to the behavior of vibration modes in disordered systems. In this context, over-smoothing in GNNs can be understood as the expansion of low-frequency modes (increased participation degree) and the localization of high-frequency modes (decreased participation degree). Based on this, we systematically reviewed the potential connection between the Anderson localization behavior in disordered systems and the over-smoothing behavior in Graph Neural Networks. A theoretical analysis was conducted, and we proposed the potential of alleviating over-smoothing by reducing the disorder in information propagation.

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges in measuring their generalization ability due to data contamination. Traditional tasks like knowledge-retrieval and reasoning may not be ideal for assessing generalization as LLMs are not trained for specific tasks. Instead, user behavior prediction, crucial for personalization, is proposed as a scalable and robust alternative. A novel framework is introduced and tested on movie and music recommendation datasets using GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct models. Results show that GPT-4o performs better than GPT-4o-mini and Llama, indicating room for improvement in all models, especially Llama.

Abstract: Measuring the generalization ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenging due to data contamination. As models grow and computation becomes cheaper, ensuring tasks and test cases are unseen during training phases will become nearly impossible. We argue that knowledge-retrieval and reasoning tasks are not ideal for measuring generalization, as LLMs are not trained for specific tasks. Instead, we propose user behavior prediction, also a key aspect of personalization, as a theoretically sound, scalable, and robust alternative. We introduce a novel framework for this approach and test it on movie and music recommendation datasets for GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct. Results align with our framework's predictions, showing GPT-4o outperforms GPT-4o-mini and Llama, though all models have much room for improvement, especially Llama.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted across diverse software engineering domains, such as code generation, program repair, and vulnerability detection. These applications require understanding beyond surface-level code patterns: value propagation, control flow, and interdependence between program elements. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate end-to-end outcomes, such as whether code is correctly repaired or generated, leaving the models ability for program semantic reasoning underexplored. This work presents CoRe, a high-quality, human-verified benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on fundamental static analysis tasks. CoRe includes 12,553 task instances spanning data dependency, control dependency, and information flow across programs written in C/C++, Java, and Python. To ensure semantic diversity and reasoning complexity, we propose a semantics-aware diverse sampling strategy that selects targets and task instances based on structural coverage and dependency depth. We evaluate 10 mainstream LLMs and show that, while they perform well at identifying dependencies, models still struggle with tasks that require deeper semantic understanding and multi-step reasoning. We further conduct qualitative analyses to uncover key challenges, such as complex control structures and backward dependency patterns, offering insights into improving LLMs code reasoning capabilities.

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with fuzz testing show promise in generating weakest preconditions (WPs) for programs. The proposed Fuzzing Guidance (FG) approach uses feedback from fuzz testing to direct LLMs towards correct WPs. FG leverages fuzz testing to check candidate WPs for validity and weaknesses, improving context refinement for LLMs. Experiments on deterministic array programs in Java demonstrate that LLMs can generate viable candidate WPs, and FG enhances this ability. This approach has practical applications in program verification, error checking, and other areas where generating WPs is crucial. <div>

Abstract: The weakest precondition (WP) of a program describes the largest set of initial states from which all terminating executions of the program satisfy a given postcondition. The generation of WPs is an important task with practical applications in areas ranging from verification to run-time error checking.
  This paper proposes the combination of Large Language Models (LLMs) and fuzz testing for generating WPs. In pursuit of this goal, we introduce Fuzzing Guidance (FG); FG acts as a means of directing LLMs towards correct WPs using program execution feedback. FG utilises fuzz testing for approximately checking the validity and weakness of candidate WPs, this information is then fed back to the LLM as a means of context refinement.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a comprehensive benchmark set of deterministic array programs in Java. Our experiments indicate that LLMs are capable of producing viable candidate WPs, and that this ability can be practically enhanced through FG.

Abstract: Assisting medical students with clinical reasoning (CR) during clinical scenario training remains a persistent challenge in medical education. This paper presents the design and architecture of the Fuzzy Supervisor Agent (FSA), a novel component for the Multi-Agent Educational Clinical Scenario Simulation (MAECSS) platform. The FSA leverages a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) to continuously interpret student interactions with specialized clinical agents (e.g., patient, physical exam, diagnostic, intervention) using pre-defined fuzzy rule bases for professionalism, medical relevance, ethical behavior, and contextual distraction. By analyzing student decision-making processes in real-time, the FSA is designed to deliver adaptive, context-aware feedback and provides assistance precisely when students encounter difficulties. This work focuses on the technical framework and rationale of the FSA, highlighting its potential to provide scalable, flexible, and human-like supervision in simulation-based medical education. Future work will include empirical evaluation and integration into broader educational settings. More detailed design and implementation is~\href{https://github.com/2sigmaEdTech/MAS/}{open sourced here}.

Abstract: The study assesses Hungary's National AI Strategy and its implementation through the analysis of strategic documents, publicly available financial records, and expert interviews with the Hungarian AI Coalition President and Chief Strategic Advisor to the Government Commissioner for AI. 22 goals from Hungary's strategy were evaluated through conceptual, governance, temporal, and financial dimensions before being benchmarked against Singapore's National AI Strategies (NAIS 1.0 and NAIS 2.0). Key findings include an estimated total of EUR 4.65 billion in AI-related public investment in Hungary. Openly available financial data was found for only half of the evaluated goals, and just three projects made up 98\% of all documented funding. The research also reveals Hungary's implementation challenges, including fragmented execution following ministerial reorganizations and the absence of designated biennial reviews since 2020. Furthermore, the paper provides targeted recommendations for Hungary's forthcoming AI strategy, drawing on Singapore's framework as a reference point. These include adapting to the era of large language models, restructuring the existing triple helix network to foster more effective dialogue and advocacy, and positioning the country as an East-West bridge for automotive AI experimentation.

Abstract: Efficient data exploration is crucial as data becomes increasingly important for accelerating processes, improving forecasts and developing new business models. Data consumers often spend 25-98 % of their time searching for suitable data due to the exponential growth, heterogeneity and distribution of data. Data catalogs can support and accelerate data exploration by using metadata to answer user queries. However, as metadata creation and maintenance is often a manual process, it is time-consuming and requires expertise. This study investigates whether LLMs can automate metadata maintenance of text-based data and generate high-quality DCAT-compatible metadata. We tested zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies with LLMs from different vendors for generating metadata such as titles and keywords, along with a fine-tuned model for classification. Our results show that LLMs can generate metadata comparable to human-created content, particularly on tasks that require advanced semantic understanding. Larger models outperformed smaller ones, and fine-tuning significantly improves classification accuracy, while few-shot prompting yields better results in most cases. Although LLMs offer a faster and reliable way to create metadata, a successful application requires careful consideration of task-specific criteria and domain context.

<title>Beyond classical and contemporary models: a transformative ai framework for student dropout prediction in distance learning using rag, prompt engineering, and cross-modal fusion</title>

Abstract: Student dropout in distance learning remains a critical challenge, with profound societal and economic consequences. While classical machine learning models leverage structured socio-demographic and behavioral data, they often fail to capture the nuanced emotional and contextual factors embedded in unstructured student interactions. This paper introduces a transformative AI framework that redefines dropout prediction through three synergistic innovations: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for domain-specific sentiment analysis, prompt engineering to decode academic stressors, and cross-modal attention fusion to dynamically align textual, behavioral, and socio-demographic insights. By grounding sentiment analysis in a curated knowledge base of pedagogical content, our RAG-enhanced BERT model interprets student comments with unprecedented contextual relevance, while optimized prompts isolate indicators of academic distress (e.g., "isolation," "workload anxiety"). A cross-modal attention layer then fuses these insights with temporal engagement patterns, creating holistic risk profiles. Evaluated on a longitudinal dataset of 4 423 students, the framework achieves 89% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.88, outperforming conventional models by 7% and reducing false negatives by 21%. Beyond prediction, the system generates interpretable interventions by retrieving contextually aligned strategies (e.g., mentorship programs for isolated learners). This work bridges the gap between predictive analytics and actionable pedagogy, offering a scalable solution to mitigate dropout risks in global education systems

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in many tasks but it often comes at a high computational cost and memory usage. Compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, are applied to reduce the memory footprint of DNNs and make it possible to accommodate them on resource-constrained edge devices. Recently, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods have been introduced with the purpose of understanding and explaining AI methods. XAI can be utilized to get to know the inner functioning of DNNs, such as the importance of different neurons and features in the overall performance of DNNs. In this paper, a novel DNN compression approach using XAI is proposed to efficiently reduce the DNN model size with negligible accuracy loss. In the proposed approach, the importance score of DNN parameters (i.e. weights) are computed using a gradient-based XAI technique called Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). Then, the scores are used to compress the DNN as follows: 1) the parameters with the negative or zero importance scores are pruned and removed from the model, 2) mixed-precision quantization is applied to quantize the weights with higher/lower score with higher/lower number of bits. The experimental results show that, the proposed compression approach reduces the model size by 64% while the accuracy is improved by 42% compared to the state-of-the-art XAI-based compression method.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) across critical domains has amplified the societal risks posed by algorithmically generated misinformation. Unlike traditional false content, LLM-generated misinformation can be self-reinforcing, highly plausible, and capable of rapid propagation across multiple languages, which traditional detection methods fail to mitigate effectively. This paper introduces a proactive defense paradigm, shifting from passive post hoc detection to anticipatory mitigation strategies. We propose a Three Pillars framework: (1) Knowledge Credibility, fortifying the integrity of training and deployed data; (2) Inference Reliability, embedding self-corrective mechanisms during reasoning; and (3) Input Robustness, enhancing the resilience of model interfaces against adversarial attacks. Through a comprehensive survey of existing techniques and a comparative meta-analysis, we demonstrate that proactive defense strategies offer up to 63\% improvement over conventional methods in misinformation prevention, despite non-trivial computational overhead and generalization challenges. We argue that future research should focus on co-designing robust knowledge foundations, reasoning certification, and attack-resistant interfaces to ensure LLMs can effectively counter misinformation across varied domains.

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed machine learning framework called P-DivGNN to reconstruct local stress fields at the micro-scale, in the context of multi-scale simulation given a periodic micro-structure mesh and mean, macro-scale, stress values. This method is based in representing a periodic micro-structure as a graph, combined with a message passing graph neural network. We are able to retrieve local stress field distributions, providing average stress values produced by a mean field reduced order model (ROM) or Finite Element (FE) simulation at the macro-scale. The prediction of local stress fields are of utmost importance considering fracture analysis or the definition of local fatigue criteria. Our model incorporates physical constraints during training to constraint local stress field equilibrium state and employs a periodic graph representation to enforce periodic boundary conditions. The benefits of the proposed physics-informed GNN are evaluated considering linear and non linear hyperelastic responses applied to varying geometries. In the non-linear hyperelastic case, the proposed method achieves significant computational speed-ups compared to FE simulation, making it particularly attractive for large-scale applications.

Abstract: Personalized learning is a student-centered educational approach that adapts content, pace, and assessment to meet each learner's unique needs. As the key technique to implement the personalized learning, learning path recommendation sequentially recommends personalized learning items such as lectures and exercises. Advances in deep learning, particularly deep reinforcement learning, have made modeling such recommendations more practical and effective. This paper proposes a multi-task LSTM model that enhances learning path recommendation by leveraging shared information across tasks. The approach reframes learning path recommendation as a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) prediction problem, generating personalized learning paths from a learner's historical interactions. The model uses a shared LSTM layer to capture common features for both learning path recommendation and deep knowledge tracing, along with task-specific LSTM layers for each objective. To avoid redundant recommendations, a non-repeat loss penalizes repeated items within the recommended learning path. Experiments on the ASSIST09 dataset show that the proposed model significantly outperforms baseline methods for the learning path recommendation.

Abstract: This study evaluates the implementation of a Generative AI-powered rule checking workflow within a graduate-level Building Information Modeling (BIM) course at a U.S. university. Over two semesters, 55 students participated in a classroom-based pilot exploring the use of GenAI for BIM compliance tasks, an area with limited prior research. The instructional design included lectures on prompt engineering and AI-driven rule checking, followed by an assignment where students used a large language model (LLM) to identify code violations in designs using Autodesk Revit. Surveys and interviews were conducted to assess student workload, learning effectiveness, and overall experience, using the NASA-TLX scale and regression analysis. Findings indicate students generally achieved learning objectives but faced challenges such as difficulties debugging AI-generated code and inconsistent tool performance, probably due to their limited prompt engineering experience. These issues increased cognitive and emotional strain, especially among students with minimal programming backgrounds. Despite these challenges, students expressed strong interest in future GenAI applications, particularly with clear instructional support.

Abstract: We argue that generative text-to-image models often struggle with prompt adherence due to the noisy and unstructured nature of large-scale datasets like LAION-5B. This forces users to rely heavily on prompt engineering to elicit desirable outputs. In this work, we propose that enforcing a consistent caption structure during training can significantly improve model controllability and alignment. We introduce Re-LAION-Caption 19M, a high-quality subset of Re-LAION-5B, comprising 19 million 1024x1024 images with captions generated by a Mistral 7B Instruct-based LLaVA-Next model. Each caption follows a four-part template: subject, setting, aesthetics, and camera details. We fine-tune PixArt-$\Sigma$ and Stable Diffusion 2 using both structured and randomly shuffled captions, and show that structured versions consistently yield higher text-image alignment scores using visual question answering (VQA) models. The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/supermodelresearch/Re-LAION-Caption19M.

Abstract: With the swift progression of image generation technology, the widespread emergence of facial deepfakes poses significant challenges to the field of security, thus amplifying the urgent need for effective deepfake detection.Existing techniques for face forgery detection can broadly be categorized into two primary groups: visual-based methods and multimodal approaches. The former often lacks clear explanations for forgery details, while the latter, which merges visual and linguistic modalities, is more prone to the issue of hallucinations.To address these shortcomings, we introduce a visual detail enhanced self-correction framework, designated CorrDetail, for interpretable face forgery detection. CorrDetail is meticulously designed to rectify authentic forgery details when provided with error-guided questioning, with the aim of fostering the ability to uncover forgery details rather than yielding hallucinated responses. Additionally, to bolster the reliability of its findings, a visual fine-grained detail enhancement module is incorporated, supplying CorrDetail with more precise visual forgery details. Ultimately, a fusion decision strategy is devised to further augment the model's discriminative capacity in handling extreme samples, through the integration of visual information compensation and model bias reduction.Experimental results demonstrate that CorrDetail not only achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to the latest methodologies but also excels in accurately identifying forged details, all while exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.

Abstract: 3D meshes are fundamental data representations for capturing complex geometric shapes in computer vision and graphics applications. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have excelled in structured data like images, extending them to irregular 3D meshes is challenging due to the non-Euclidean nature of the data. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) offer a solution by applying convolutions to graph-structured data, but many existing methods rely on isotropic filters or spectral decomposition, limiting their ability to capture both local and global mesh features. In this paper, we introduce 3D Geometric Mesh Network (3DGeoMeshNet), a novel GCN-based framework that uses anisotropic convolution layers to effectively learn both global and local features directly in the spatial domain. Unlike previous approaches that convert meshes into intermediate representations like voxel grids or point clouds, our method preserves the original polygonal mesh format throughout the reconstruction process, enabling more accurate shape reconstruction. Our architecture features a multi-scale encoder-decoder structure, where separate global and local pathways capture both large-scale geometric structures and fine-grained local details. Extensive experiments on the COMA dataset containing human faces demonstrate the efficiency of 3DGeoMeshNet in terms of reconstruction accuracy.

Abstract: Frontier Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Gemini can decipher cryptic compiler errors for novice programmers, but their computational scale, cost, and tendency to over-assist make them problematic for widespread pedagogical adoption. This work demonstrates that smaller, specialised language models, enhanced via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), present a more viable alternative for educational tools. We utilise a new dataset of 40,000 C compiler error explanations, derived from real introductory programming (CS1/2) student-generated programming errors, which we used to fine-tune three open-source models: Qwen3-4B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Qwen3-32B. We performed a dual evaluation, combining expert human reviews with a large-scale automated analysis of 8,000 responses using a validated LLM-as-judge ensemble. Our results show that SFT significantly boosts the pedagogical quality of smaller models, achieving performance comparable to much larger models. We analyse the trade-offs between model size and quality, confirming that fine-tuning compact, efficient models on high-quality, domain-specific data is a potent strategy for creating specialised models to drive educational tools. We provide a replicable methodology to foster broader access to generative AI capabilities in educational contexts.

<title>Enjoying Non-linearity in Multinomial Logistic Bandits</title>

Abstract: We consider the multinomial logistic bandit problem, a variant of generalized linear bandits where a learner interacts with an environment by selecting actions to maximize expected rewards based on probabilistic feedback from multiple possible outcomes. In the binary setting, recent work has focused on understanding the impact of the non-linearity of the logistic model (Faury et al., 2020; Abeille et al., 2021). They introduced a problem-dependent constant $\kappa_*$, that may be exponentially large in some problem parameters and which is captured by the derivative of the sigmoid function. It encapsulates the non-linearity and improves existing regret guarantees over $T$ rounds from $\smash{O(d\sqrt{T})}$ to $\smash{O(d\sqrt{T/\kappa_*})}$, where $d$ is the dimension of the parameter space. We extend their analysis to the multinomial logistic bandit framework, making it suitable for complex applications with more than two choices, such as reinforcement learning or recommender systems. To achieve this, we extend the definition of $\kappa_*$ to the multinomial setting and propose an efficient algorithm that leverages the problem's non-linearity. Our method yields a problem-dependent regret bound of order $ \smash{\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}( Kd \sqrt{{T}/{\kappa_*}})} $, where $K$ is the number of actions and $\kappa_* \ge 1$. This improves upon the best existing guarantees of order $ \smash{\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}( Kd \sqrt{T} )} $. Moreover, we provide a $\smash{ \Omega(d\sqrt{T/\kappa_*})}$ lower-bound, showing that our dependence on $\kappa_*$ is optimal.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into browser extensions has revolutionized web browsing, enabling sophisticated functionalities like content summarization, intelligent translation, and context-aware writing assistance. However, these AI-powered extensions introduce unprecedented challenges in testing and reliability assurance. Traditional browser extension testing approaches fail to address the non-deterministic behavior, context-sensitivity, and complex web environment integration inherent to LLM-powered extensions. Similarly, existing LLM testing methodologies operate in isolation from browser-specific contexts, creating a critical gap in effective evaluation frameworks. To bridge this gap, we present ASSURE, a modular automated testing framework specifically designed for AI-powered browser extensions. ASSURE comprises three principal components: (1) a modular test case generation engine that supports plugin-based extension of testing scenarios, (2) an automated execution framework that orchestrates the complex interactions between web content, extension processing, and AI model behavior, and (3) a configurable validation pipeline that systematically evaluates behavioral consistency and security invariants rather than relying on exact output matching. Our evaluation across six widely-used AI browser extensions demonstrates ASSURE's effectiveness, identifying 531 distinct issues spanning security vulnerabilities, metamorphic relation violations, and content alignment problems. ASSURE achieves 6.4x improved testing throughput compared to manual approaches, detecting critical security vulnerabilities within 12.4 minutes on average. This efficiency makes ASSURE practical for integration into development pipelines, offering a comprehensive solution to the unique challenges of testing AI-powered browser extensions.

Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning, such as learning rate decay and defining a stopping criterion, often relies on monitoring the validation loss. This paper presents NeVe, a dynamic training approach that adjusts the learning rate and defines the stop criterion based on the novel notion of "neural velocity". The neural velocity measures the rate of change of each neuron's transfer function and is an indicator of model convergence: sampling neural velocity can be performed even by forwarding noise in the network, reducing the need for a held-out dataset. Our findings show the potential of neural velocity as a key metric for optimizing neural network training efficiently

Abstract: In this paper, we propose PLACE (Prompt Learning for Attributed Community Search), an innovative graph prompt learning framework for ACS. Enlightened by prompt-tuning in Natural Language Processing (NLP), where learnable prompt tokens are inserted to contextualize NLP queries, PLACE integrates structural and learnable prompt tokens into the graph as a query-dependent refinement mechanism, forming a prompt-augmented graph. Within this prompt-augmented graph structure, the learned prompt tokens serve as a bridge that strengthens connections between graph nodes for the query, enabling the GNN to more effectively identify patterns of structural cohesiveness and attribute similarity related to the specific query. We employ an alternating training paradigm to optimize both the prompt parameters and the GNN jointly. Moreover, we design a divide-and-conquer strategy to enhance scalability, supporting the model to handle million-scale graphs. Extensive experiments on 9 real-world graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of PLACE for three types of ACS queries, where PLACE achieves higher F1 scores by 22% compared to the state-of-the-arts on average.

Abstract: We investigate the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Decomposition-LSTM (DLSTM) networks, combined with an ensemble algorithm, to predict solar flare occurrences using time-series data from the GOES catalog. The dataset spans from 2003 to 2023 and includes 151,071 flare events. Among approximately possible patterns, 7,552 yearly pattern windows are identified, highlighting the challenge of long-term forecasting due to the Sun's complex, self-organized criticality-driven behavior. A sliding window technique is employed to detect temporal quasi-patterns in both irregular and regularized flare time series. Regularization reduces complexity, enhances large flare activity, and captures active days more effectively. To address class imbalance, resampling methods are applied. LSTM and DLSTM models are trained on sequences of peak fluxes and waiting times from irregular time series, while LSTM and DLSTM, integrated with an ensemble approach, are applied to sliding windows of regularized time series with a 3-hour interval. Performance metrics, particularly TSS (0.74), recall (0.95) and the area under the curve (AUC=0.87) in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), indicate that DLSTM with an ensemble approach on regularized time series outperforms other models, offering more accurate large-flare forecasts with fewer false errors compared to models trained on irregular time series. The superior performance of DLSTM is attributed to its ability to decompose time series into trend and seasonal components, effectively isolating random noise. This study underscores the potential of advanced machine learning techniques for solar flare prediction and highlights the importance of incorporating various solar cycle phases and resampling strategies to enhance forecasting reliability.

<title>Conditional Graph Neural Network for Predicting Soft Tissue Deformation and Forces</title>

Abstract: Soft tissue simulation in virtual environments is becoming increasingly important for medical applications. However, the high deformability of soft tissue poses significant challenges. Existing methods rely on segmentation, meshing and estimation of stiffness properties of tissues. In addition, the integration of haptic feedback requires precise force estimation to enable a more immersive experience. We introduce a novel data-driven model, a conditional graph neural network (cGNN) to tackle this complexity. Our model takes surface points and the location of applied forces, and is specifically designed to predict the deformation of the points and the forces exerted on them. We trained our model on experimentally collected surface tracking data of a soft tissue phantom and used transfer learning to overcome the data scarcity by initially training it with mass-spring simulations and fine-tuning it with the experimental data. This approach improves the generalisation capability of the model and enables accurate predictions of tissue deformations and corresponding interaction forces. The results demonstrate that the model can predict deformations with a distance error of 0.35$\pm$0.03 mm for deformations up to 30 mm and the force with an absolute error of 0.37$\pm$0.05 N for forces up to 7.5 N. Our data-driven approach presents a promising solution to the intricate challenge of simulating soft tissues within virtual environments. Beyond its applicability in medical simulations, this approach holds the potential to benefit various fields where realistic soft tissue simulations are required.

Abstract: AI agents and business automation tools interacting with external web services require standardized, machine-readable information about their APIs in the form of API specifications. However, the information about APIs available online is often presented as unstructured, free-form HTML documentation, requiring external users to spend significant time manually converting it into a structured format. To address this, we introduce OASBuilder, a novel framework that transforms long and diverse API documentation pages into consistent, machine-readable API specifications. This is achieved through a carefully crafted pipeline that integrates large language models and rule-based algorithms which are guided by domain knowledge of the structure of documentation webpages. Our experiments demonstrate that OASBuilder generalizes well across hundreds of APIs, and produces valid OpenAPI specifications that encapsulate most of the information from the original documentation. OASBuilder has been successfully implemented in an enterprise environment, saving thousands of hours of manual effort and making hundreds of complex enterprise APIs accessible as tools for LLMs.

<title>PWD: Prior-Guided and Wavelet-Enhanced Diffusion Model for Limited-Angle CT</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.05317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative diffusion models have received increasing attention in medical imaging, particularly in limited-angle computed tomography (LACT). Standard diffusion models achieve high-quality image reconstruction but require a large number of sampling steps during inference, resulting in substantial computational overhead. Although skip-sampling strategies have been proposed to improve efficiency, they often lead to loss of fine structural details. To address this issue, we propose a prior information embedding and wavelet feature fusion fast sampling diffusion model for LACT reconstruction. The PWD enables efficient sampling while preserving reconstruction fidelity in LACT, and effectively mitigates the degradation typically introduced by skip-sampling. Specifically, during the training phase, PWD maps the distribution of LACT images to that of fully sampled target images, enabling the model to learn structural correspondences between them. During inference, the LACT image serves as an explicit prior to guide the sampling trajectory, allowing for high-quality reconstruction with significantly fewer steps. In addition, PWD performs multi-scale feature fusion in the wavelet domain, effectively enhancing the reconstruction of fine details by leveraging both low-frequency and high-frequency information. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on clinical dental arch CBCT and periapical datasets demonstrate that PWD outperforms existing methods under the same sampling condition. Using only 50 sampling steps, PWD achieves at least 1.7 dB improvement in PSNR and 10% gain in SSIM.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automated discharge summary generation, they still suffer from hallucination issues, such as generating inaccurate content or fabricating information without valid sources. In addition, electronic medical records (EMRs) typically consist of long-form data, making it challenging for LLMs to attribute the generated content to the sources. To address these challenges, we propose LCDS, a Logic-Controlled Discharge Summary generation system. LCDS constructs a source mapping table by calculating textual similarity between EMRs and discharge summaries to constrain the scope of summarized content. Moreover, LCDS incorporates a comprehensive set of logical rules, enabling it to generate more reliable silver discharge summaries tailored to different clinical fields. Furthermore, LCDS supports source attribution for generated content, allowing experts to efficiently review, provide feedback, and rectify errors. The resulting golden discharge summaries are subsequently recorded for incremental fine-tuning of LLMs. Our project and demo video are in the GitHub repository https://github.com/ycycyc02/LCDS.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-assisted education have encouraged the integration of vision-language models (VLMs) into academic assessment, particularly for tasks that require both quantitative and qualitative evaluation. However, existing VLM based approaches struggle with complex educational artifacts, such as programming tasks with executable components and measurable outputs, that require structured reasoning and alignment with clearly defined evaluation criteria. We introduce AGACCI, a multi-agent system that distributes specialized evaluation roles across collaborative agents to improve accuracy, interpretability, and consistency in code-oriented assessment. To evaluate the framework, we collected 360 graduate-level code-based assignments from 60 participants, each annotated by domain experts with binary rubric scores and qualitative feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that AGACCI outperforms a single GPT-based baseline in terms of rubric and feedback accuracy, relevance, consistency, and coherence, while preserving the instructional intent and evaluative depth of expert assessments. Although performance varies across task types, AGACCI highlights the potential of multi-agent systems for scalable and context-aware educational evaluation.

Abstract: In many reinforcement learning (RL) applications, augmenting the task rewards with heuristic rewards that encode human priors about how a task should be solved is crucial for achieving desirable performance. However, because such heuristics are usually not optimal, much human effort and computational resources are wasted in carefully balancing tasks and heuristic rewards. Theoretically rigorous ways of incorporating heuristics rely on the idea of \textit{policy invariance}, which guarantees that the performance of a policy obtained by maximizing heuristic rewards is the same as the optimal policy with respect to the task reward. However, in practice, policy invariance doesn't result in policy improvement, and such methods are known to empirically perform poorly. We propose a new paradigm to mitigate reward hacking and effectively use heuristics based on the practical goal of maximizing policy improvement instead of policy improvement. Our framework, Heuristic Enhanced Policy Optimization (HEPO), effectively leverages heuristics while avoiding the pitfall of prior methods for mitigating reward hacking. HEPO achieves superior performance on standard benchmarks with well-engineered reward functions. More surprisingly, HEPO allows policy optimization to achieve good performance even when heuristics are not well-engineered and designed by non-expert humans, showcasing HEPO's ability to reduce human effort in reward design. % HEPO is a plug-and-play optimization method for leveraging heuristics in reinforcement learning. Code is available at https://github.com/Improbable-AI/hepo.

Abstract: Foundation models for structured time series data must contend with a fundamental challenge: observations often conflate the true underlying physical phenomena with systematic distortions introduced by measurement instruments. This entanglement limits model generalization, especially in heterogeneous or multi-instrument settings. We present a causally-motivated foundation model that explicitly disentangles physical and instrumental factors using a dual-encoder architecture trained with structured contrastive learning. Leveraging naturally occurring observational triplets (i.e., where the same target is measured under varying conditions, and distinct targets are measured under shared conditions) our model learns separate latent representations for the underlying physical signal and instrument effects. Evaluated on simulated astronomical time series designed to resemble the complexity of variable stars observed by missions like NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), our method significantly outperforms traditional single-latent space foundation models on downstream prediction tasks, particularly in low-data regimes. These results demonstrate that our model supports key capabilities of foundation models, including few-shot generalization and efficient adaptation, and highlight the importance of encoding causal structure into representation learning for structured data.

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing highlight two key factors for improving reasoning in large language models (LLMs): (i) allocating more test-time compute tends to help on harder problems but often introduces redundancy in the reasoning trace, and (ii) compute is most effective when reasoning is systematic and incremental, forming structured chains of thought (CoTs) akin to human problem-solving. To study these factors in isolation, we introduce a controlled setting based on shortest-path tasks in layered graphs. We train decoder-only transformers on question-trace-answer triples using a custom tokenizer, comparing models trained on optimal bottom-up dynamic programming traces with those trained on longer, valid traces involving backtracking. Surprisingly, with the same training-token budget, models trained on inefficient traces generalize better to unseen graphs. This benefit is not due to length alone-injecting arbitrary redundancy into reasoning traces fails to help and can even hurt performance. Instead, we find that generalization correlates with the model's confidence in next-token prediction, suggesting that long, coherent, and locally incremental traces make the training signal easier to optimize.

Abstract: Continual post-training (CPT) is a popular and effective technique for adapting foundation models like multimodal large language models to specific and ever-evolving downstream tasks. While existing research has primarily concentrated on methods like data replay, model expansion, or parameter regularization, the fundamental role of the learning paradigm within CPT remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two core post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge retention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising seven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base model for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant findings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. In contrast, RFT inherently preserves prior knowledge and achieve performance comparable to multi-task training. (2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the model's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro). Conversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis shows that explicit mechanisms, such as KL penalty and chain-of-thought reasoning, are not the primary factors. Instead, we find that the implicit regularization inherent to RFT is a key factor in mitigating forgetting. Finally, we propose a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm to improve the stability and efficiency of RFT. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the superiority of RFT as a robust paradigm for continual post-training.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are primarily accessed via commercial APIs, but this often requires users to expose their data to service providers. In this paper, we explore how users can stay in control of their data by using privacy profiles: simple natural language instructions that say what should and should not be revealed. We build a framework where a local model uses these instructions to rewrite queries, only hiding details deemed sensitive by the user, before sending them to an external model, thus balancing privacy with performance. To support this research, we introduce PEEP, a multilingual dataset of real user queries annotated to mark private content and paired with synthetic privacy profiles. Our experiments with lightweight LLMs show they can follow these instructions to some extent, but also face consistent challenges, highlighting the need for models that better understand and comply with user-defined privacy preferences.

Abstract: We present $\textbf{P}$robabilistically $\textbf{T}$ightened $\textbf{Li}$near $\textbf{R}$elaxation-based $\textbf{P}$erturbation $\textbf{A}$nalysis ($\texttt{PT-LiRPA}$), a novel framework that combines over-approximation techniques from LiRPA-based approaches with a sampling-based method to compute tight intermediate reachable sets. In detail, we show that with negligible computational overhead, $\texttt{PT-LiRPA}$ exploiting the estimated reachable sets, significantly tightens the lower and upper linear bounds of a neural network's output, reducing the computational cost of formal verification tools while providing probabilistic guarantees on verification soundness. Extensive experiments on standard formal verification benchmarks, including the International Verification of Neural Networks Competition, show that our $\texttt{PT-LiRPA}$-based verifier improves robustness certificates by up to 3.31X and 2.26X compared to related work. Importantly, our probabilistic approach results in a valuable solution for challenging competition entries where state-of-the-art formal verification methods fail, allowing us to provide answers with high confidence (i.e., at least 99%).

Abstract: Air pollution from agricultural emissions is a significant yet often overlooked contributor to environmental and public health challenges. Traditional air quality forecasting models rely on physics-based approaches, which struggle to capture complex, nonlinear pollutant interactions. In this work, we explore forecasting N$_2$O agricultural emissions through evaluating popular architectures, and proposing two novel deep learning architectures, EmissionNet (ENV) and EmissionNet-Transformer (ENT). These models leverage convolutional and transformer-based architectures to extract spatial-temporal dependencies from high-resolution emissions data

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance in domains like mathematics, factual QA, and code generation, yet their multilingual reasoning capabilities in these tasks remain underdeveloped. Especially for low-resource languages such as Swahili or Thai, LLMs can often misinterpret prompts or default to reasoning in English. This implicit bias toward high-resource languages undermines factual accuracy, interpretability, and trust. Current multilingual benchmarks focus only on final answers, overlooking whether models actually reason in the target language. To address this gap, we introduce GeoFact-X, a geography-based multilingual factual reasoning benchmark with annotated reasoning traces in five languages: English, Hindi, Japanese, Swahili, and Thai. We further propose BRIDGE, a novel training method that guides supervised fine-tuning and test-time reinforcement learning with a language-consistency reward to align reasoning with the input language. Finally, we develop an automatic evaluation protocol using LLM-as-a-judge to assess answer correctness and the quality and language consistency of reasoning traces, enabling nuanced and scalable analysis beyond surface-level metrics. Our results show that BRIDGE significantly enhances multilingual reasoning fidelity, demonstrating that reasoning-aware multilingual reinforcement learning is crucial for robust cross-lingual generalization. https://jd730.github.io/projects/GeoFact-X_BRIDGE

<title>"Lost-in-the-Later": Framework for Quantifying Contextual Grounding in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models are capable of leveraging both contextual and parametric knowledge but how they prioritize and integrate these sources remains underexplored. We introduce CoPE, a novel evaluation framework that systematically measures contextual knowledge (CK) and parametric knowledge (PK) across models and languages. Using our MultiWikiAtomic dataset in English, Spanish, and Danish, we analyze how large language models (LLMs) integrate context, prioritize information, and incorporate PK in open-ended question answering. Our analysis uncovers a phenomenon we call lost-in-the-later, where LLMs tend to overlook or deprioritize information that appears later in a given context, revealing a strong positional bias that affects contextual grounding. We further find that reasoning models, as well as non-reasoning models prompted with chain-of-thought (CoT), use context even less than non-reasoning models without CoT and fail to mitigate the lost-in-the-later effect. CoT prompting, in particular, results in lower recall and shorter responses, leading to degraded contextual grounding. Based on these insights, we design prompt-based methods to effectively leverage input context. A case study applying CoPE to summarization demonstrates that CK-informed prompting improves factual grounding and reduces hallucination.

Abstract: Uniform and excessive herbicide application in modern agriculture contributes to increased input costs, environmental pollution, and the emergence of herbicide resistant weeds. To address these challenges, we developed a vision guided, AI-driven variable rate sprayer system capable of detecting weed presence, estimating canopy size, and dynamically adjusting nozzle activation in real time. The system integrates lightweight YOLO11n and YOLO11n-seg deep learning models, deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano for onboard inference, and uses an Arduino Uno-based relay interface to control solenoid actuated nozzles based on canopy segmentation results. Indoor trials were conducted using 15 potted Hibiscus rosa sinensis plants of varying canopy sizes to simulate a range of weed patch scenarios. The YOLO11n model achieved a mean average precision (mAP@50) of 0.98, with a precision of 0.99 and a recall close to 1.0. The YOLO11n-seg segmentation model achieved a mAP@50 of 0.48, precision of 0.55, and recall of 0.52. System performance was validated using water sensitive paper, which showed an average spray coverage of 24.22% in zones where canopy was present. An upward trend in mean spray coverage from 16.22% for small canopies to 21.46% and 21.65% for medium and large canopies, respectively, demonstrated the system's capability to adjust spray output based on canopy size in real time. These results highlight the potential of combining real time deep learning with low-cost embedded hardware for selective herbicide application. Future work will focus on expanding the detection capabilities to include three common weed species in South Dakota: water hemp (Amaranthus tuberculatus), kochia (Bassia scoparia), and foxtail (Setaria spp.), followed by further validation in both indoor and field trials within soybean and corn production systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT demonstrated the potential to replicate human language abilities through technology, ranging from text generation to engaging in conversations. However, it remains controversial to what extent these systems truly understand language. We examine this issue by narrowing the question down to the semantics of LLMs at the word and sentence level. By examining the inner workings of LLMs and their generated representation of language and by drawing on classical semantic theories by Frege and Russell, we get a more nuanced picture of the potential semantic capabilities of LLMs.

Abstract: Automatic toxic language detection is critical for creating safe, inclusive online spaces. However, it is a highly subjective task, with perceptions of toxic language shaped by community norms and lived experience. Existing toxicity detection models are typically trained on annotations that collapse diverse annotator perspectives into a single ground truth, erasing important context-specific notions of toxicity such as reclaimed language. To address this, we introduce MODELCITIZENS, a dataset of 6.8K social media posts and 40K toxicity annotations across diverse identity groups. To capture the role of conversational context on toxicity, typical of social media posts, we augment MODELCITIZENS posts with LLM-generated conversational scenarios. State-of-the-art toxicity detection tools (e.g. OpenAI Moderation API, GPT-o4-mini) underperform on MODELCITIZENS, with further degradation on context-augmented posts. Finally, we release LLAMACITIZEN-8B and GEMMACITIZEN-12B, LLaMA- and Gemma-based models finetuned on MODELCITIZENS, which outperform GPT-o4-mini by 5.5% on in-distribution evaluations. Our findings highlight the importance of community-informed annotation and modeling for inclusive content moderation.

Abstract: We introduce scenario-based cognitive status identification in older drivers from Naturalistic driving videos and large vision models. In recent times, cognitive decline, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is often underdiagnosed due to the time-consuming and costly nature of current diagnostic methods. By analyzing real-world driving behavior captured through in-vehicle systems, this research aims to extract "digital fingerprints" that correlate with functional decline and clinical features of MCI and AD. Moreover, modern large vision models can draw meaningful insights from everyday driving patterns of older patients to early detect cognitive decline. We propose a framework that uses large vision models and naturalistic driving videos to analyze driver behavior, classify cognitive status and predict disease progression. We leverage the strong relationship between real-world driving behavior as an observation of the current cognitive status of the drivers where the vehicle can be utilized as a "diagnostic tool". Our method identifies early warning signs of functional impairment, contributing to proactive intervention strategies. This work enhances early detection and supports the development of scalable, non-invasive monitoring systems to mitigate the growing societal and economic burden of cognitive decline in the aging population.

<title>2048: Reinforcement Learning in a Delayed Reward Environment</title>

Abstract: Delayed and sparse rewards present a fundamental obstacle for reinforcement-learning (RL) agents, which struggle to assign credit for actions whose benefits emerge many steps later. The sliding-tile game 2048 epitomizes this challenge: although frequent small score changes yield immediate feedback, they often mislead agents into locally optimal but globally suboptimal strategies. In this work, we introduce a unified, distributional multi-step RL framework designed to directly optimize long-horizon performance. Using the open source Gym-2048 environment we develop and compare four agent variants: standard DQN, PPO, QR-DQN (Quantile Regression DQN), and a novel Horizon-DQN (H-DQN) that integrates distributional learning, dueling architectures, noisy networks, prioritized replay, and more. Empirical evaluation reveals a clear hierarchy in effectiveness: max episode scores improve from 3.988K (DQN) to 5.756K (PPO), 8.66K (QR-DQN), and 18.21K (H-DQN), with H-DQN reaching the 2048 tile. Upon scaling H-DQN it reaches a max score 41.828K and a 4096 tile. These results demonstrate that distributional, multi-step targets substantially enhance performance in sparse-reward domains, and they suggest promising avenues for further gains through model-based planning and curriculum learning.

Abstract: We present the Methods for Open Agent Systems Evaluation Initiative (MOASEI) Competition, a multi-agent AI benchmarking event designed to evaluate decision-making under open-world conditions. Built on the free-range-zoo environment suite, MOASEI introduced dynamic, partially observable domains with agent and task openness--settings where entities may appear, disappear, or change behavior over time. The 2025 competition featured three tracks--Wildfire, Rideshare, and Cybersecurity--each highlighting distinct dimensions of openness and coordination complexity. Eleven teams from international institutions participated, with four of those teams submitting diverse solutions including graph neural networks, convolutional architectures, predictive modeling, and large language model--driven meta--optimization. Evaluation metrics centered on expected utility, robustness to perturbations, and responsiveness to environmental change. The results reveal promising strategies for generalization and adaptation in open environments, offering both empirical insight and infrastructure for future research. This report details the competition's design, findings, and contributions to the open-agent systems research community.

Abstract: Zero-shot reinforcement learning is necessary for extracting optimal policies in absence of concrete rewards for fast adaptation to future problem settings. Forward-backward representations (FB) have emerged as a promising method for learning optimal policies in absence of rewards via a factorization of the policy occupancy measure. However, up until now, FB and many similar zero-shot reinforcement learning algorithms have been decoupled from the exploration problem, generally relying on other exploration algorithms for data collection. We argue that FB representations should fundamentally be used for exploration in order to learn more efficiently. With this goal in mind, we design exploration policies that arise naturally from the FB representation that minimize the posterior variance of the FB representation, hence minimizing its epistemic uncertainty. We empirically demonstrate that such principled exploration strategies improve sample complexity of the FB algorithm considerably in comparison to other exploration methods. Code is publicly available at https://sites.google.com/view/fbee-url.

Abstract: Diffusion models for image generation function by progressively adding noise to an image set and training a model to separate out the signal from the noise. The noise profile used by these models is white noise -- that is, noise based on independent normal distributions at each point whose mean and variance is independent of the scale. By contrast, most natural image sets exhibit a type of scale invariance in their low-order statistical properties characterized by a power-law scaling. Consequently, natural images are closer (in a quantifiable sense) to a different probability distribution that emphasizes large scale correlations and de-emphasizes small scale correlations. These scale invariant noise profiles can be incorporated into diffusion models in place of white noise to form what we will call a ``Cloud Diffusion Model". We argue that these models can lead to faster inference, improved high-frequency details, and greater controllability. In a follow-up paper, we will build and train a Cloud Diffusion Model that uses scale invariance at a fundamental level and compare it to classic, white noise diffusion models.

Abstract: Data-driven science and computation have advanced immensely to construct complex functional relationships using trainable parameters. However, efficiently discovering interpretable and accurate closed-form expressions from complex dataset remains a challenge. The article presents a novel approach called Explainable Hierarchical Deep Learning Neural Networks or Ex-HiDeNN that uses an accurate, frugal, fast, separable, and scalable neural architecture with symbolic regression to discover closed-form expressions from limited observation. The article presents the two-step Ex-HiDeNN algorithm with a separability checker embedded in it. The accuracy and efficiency of Ex-HiDeNN are tested on several benchmark problems, including discerning a dynamical system from data, and the outcomes are reported. Ex-HiDeNN generally shows outstanding approximation capability in these benchmarks, producing orders of magnitude smaller errors compared to reference data and traditional symbolic regression. Later, Ex-HiDeNN is applied to three engineering applications: a) discovering a closed-form fatigue equation, b) identification of hardness from micro-indentation test data, and c) discovering the expression for the yield surface with data. In every case, Ex-HiDeNN outperformed the reference methods used in the literature. The proposed method is built upon the foundation and published works of the authors on Hierarchical Deep Learning Neural Network (HiDeNN) and Convolutional HiDeNN. The article also provides a clear idea about the current limitations and future extensions of Ex-HiDeNN.

<title>Disappearing Ink: Obfuscation Breaks N-gram Code Watermarks in Theory and Practice</title>

Abstract: Distinguishing AI-generated code from human-written code is becoming crucial for tasks such as authorship attribution, content tracking, and misuse detection. Based on this, N-gram-based watermarking schemes have emerged as prominent, which inject secret watermarks to be detected during the generation.
  However, their robustness in code content remains insufficiently evaluated. Most claims rely solely on defenses against simple code transformations or code optimizations as a simulation of attack, creating a questionable sense of robustness. In contrast, more sophisticated schemes already exist in the software engineering world, e.g., code obfuscation, which significantly alters code while preserving functionality. Although obfuscation is commonly used to protect intellectual property or evade software scanners, the robustness of code watermarking techniques against such transformations remains largely unexplored.
  In this work, we formally model the code obfuscation and prove the impossibility of N-gram-based watermarking's robustness with only one intuitive and experimentally verified assumption, distribution consistency, satisfied. Given the original false positive rate of the watermarking detection, the ratio that the detector failed on the watermarked code after obfuscation will increase to 1 - fpr.
  The experiments have been performed on three SOTA watermarking schemes, two LLMs, two programming languages, four code benchmarks, and four obfuscators. Among them, all watermarking detectors show coin-flipping detection abilities on obfuscated codes (AUROC tightly surrounds 0.5). Among all models, watermarking schemes, and datasets, both programming languages own obfuscators that can achieve attack effects with no detection AUROC higher than 0.6 after the attack. Based on the theoretical and practical observations, we also proposed a potential path of robust code watermarking.

Abstract: Motivated by the growing demand for retrieval systems that operate across modalities, we introduce llama-nemoretriever-colembed, a unified text-image retrieval model that delivers state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks. We release two model variants, 1B and 3B. The 3B model achieves state of the art performance, scoring NDCG@5 91.0 on ViDoRe V1 and 63.5 on ViDoRe V2, placing first on both leaderboards as of June 27, 2025.
  Our approach leverages the NVIDIA Eagle2 Vision-Language model (VLM), modifies its architecture by replacing causal attention with bidirectional attention, and integrates a ColBERT-style late interaction mechanism to enable fine-grained multimodal retrieval in a shared embedding space. While this mechanism delivers superior retrieval accuracy, it introduces trade-offs in storage and efficiency. We provide a comprehensive analysis of these trade-offs. Additionally, we adopt a two-stage training strategy to enhance the model's retrieval capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and o1 have demonstrated strong performance on clinical natural language processing (NLP) tasks across multiple medical benchmarks. Nonetheless, two high-impact NLP tasks - structured tabular reporting from nurse dictations and medical order extraction from doctor-patient consultations - remain underexplored due to data scarcity and sensitivity, despite active industry efforts. Practical solutions to these real-world clinical tasks can significantly reduce the documentation burden on healthcare providers, allowing greater focus on patient care. In this paper, we investigate these two challenging tasks using private and open-source clinical datasets, evaluating the performance of both open- and closed-weight LLMs, and analyzing their respective strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we propose an agentic pipeline for generating realistic, non-sensitive nurse dictations, enabling structured extraction of clinical observations. To support further research in both areas, we release SYNUR and SIMORD, the first open-source datasets for nurse observation extraction and medical order extraction.

Abstract: Empirical risk minimization (ERM) incentivizes models to exploit shortcuts, i.e., spurious correlations between input attributes and labels that are prevalent in the majority of the training data but unrelated to the task at hand. This reliance hinders generalization on minority examples, where such correlations do not hold. Existing shortcut mitigation approaches are model-specific, difficult to tune, computationally expensive, and fail to improve learned representations. To address these issues, we propose InterpoLated Learning (InterpoLL) which interpolates the representations of majority examples to include features from intra-class minority examples with shortcut-mitigating patterns. This weakens shortcut influence, enabling models to acquire features predictive across both minority and majority examples. Experimental results on multiple natural language understanding tasks demonstrate that InterpoLL improves minority generalization over both ERM and state-of-the-art shortcut mitigation methods, without compromising accuracy on majority examples. Notably, these gains persist across encoder, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only architectures, demonstrating the method's broad applicability.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle with noisy edges. We propose Latent Space Constrained Graph Neural Networks (LSC-GNN) to incorporate external "clean" links and guide embeddings of a noisy target graph. We train two encoders--one on the full graph (target plus external edges) and another on a regularization graph excluding the target's potentially noisy links--then penalize discrepancies between their latent representations. This constraint steers the model away from overfitting spurious edges. Experiments on benchmark datasets show LSC-GNN outperforms standard and noise-resilient GNNs in graphs subjected to moderate noise. We extend LSC-GNN to heterogeneous graphs and validate it on a small protein-metabolite network, where metabolite-protein interactions reduce noise in protein co-occurrence data. Our results highlight LSC-GNN's potential to boost predictive performance and interpretability in settings with noisy relational structures.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to grow daily, more exciting (and somewhat controversial) technology emerges every other day. As we see the advancements in AI, we see more and more people becoming skeptical of it. This paper explores the complications and confusion around the ethics of generative AI art. We delve deep into the ethical side of AI, specifically generative art. We step back from the excitement and observe the impossible conundrums that this impressive technology produces. Covering environmental consequences, celebrity representation, intellectual property, deep fakes, and artist displacement. Our research found that generative AI art is responsible for increased carbon emissions, spreading misinformation, copyright infringement, unlawful depiction, and job displacement. In light of this, we propose multiple possible solutions for these problems. We address each situation's history, cause, and consequences and offer different viewpoints. At the root of it all, though, the central theme is that generative AI Art needs to be correctly legislated and regulated.

Abstract: We present A1, an agentic execution driven system that transforms any LLM into an end-to-end exploit generator. A1 has no hand-crafted heuristics and provides the agent with six domain-specific tools that enable autonomous vulnerability discovery. The agent can flexibly leverage these tools to understand smart contract behavior, generate exploit strategies, test them on blockchain states, and refine approaches based on execution feedback. All outputs are concretely validated to eliminate false positives.
  The evaluation across 36 real-world vulnerable contracts on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain demonstrates a 62.96% (17 out of 27) success rate on the VERITE benchmark. Beyond the VERITE dataset, A1 identified 9 additional vulnerable contracts, with 5 cases occurring after the strongest model's training cutoff date. Across all 26 successful cases, A1 extracts up to 8.59 million USD per case and 9.33 million USD total. Through 432 experiments across six LLMs, we analyze iteration-wise performance showing diminishing returns with average marginal gains of +9.7%, +3.7%, +5.1%, and +2.8% for iterations 2-5 respectively, with per-experiment costs ranging $0.01-$3.59. A Monte Carlo analysis of 19 historical attacks shows success probabilities of 85.9%-88.8% without detection delays.
  We investigate whether an attacker or a defender benefits most from deploying A1 as a continuous on-chain scanning system. Our model shows that OpenAI's o3-pro maintains profitability up to a 30.0 days scanning delay at 0.100% vulnerability incidence rates, while faster models require >=1.000% rates to break-even. The findings exposes a troubling asymmetry: at 0.1% vulnerability rates, attackers achieve an on-chain scanning profitability at a $6000 exploit value, while defenders require $60000, raising fundamental questions about whether AI agents inevitably favor exploitation over defense.

Covering 89 elements, MP-ALOE was created using active learning and primarily consists of off-equilibrium structures. We benchmark a machine learning interatomic potential trained on MP-ALOE, and evaluate its performance on a series of benchmarks, including predicting the thermochemical properties of equilibrium structures; predicting forces of far-from-equilibrium structures; maintaining physical soundness under static extreme deformations; and molecular dynamic stability under extreme temperatures and pressures. MP-ALOE shows strong performance on all of these benchmarks, and is made public for the broader community to utilize.

<title>Search-based Selection of Metamorphic Relations for Optimized Robustness Testing of Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Assessing the trustworthiness of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as robustness, has garnered significant attention. Recently, metamorphic testing that defines Metamorphic Relations (MRs) has been widely applied to evaluate the robustness of LLM executions. However, the MR-based robustness testing still requires a scalable number of MRs, thereby necessitating the optimization of selecting MRs. Most extant LLM testing studies are limited to automatically generating test cases (i.e., MRs) to enhance failure detection. Additionally, most studies only considered a limited test space of single perturbation MRs in their evaluation of LLMs. In contrast, our paper proposes a search-based approach for optimizing the MR groups to maximize failure detection and minimize the LLM execution cost. Moreover, our approach covers the combinatorial perturbations in MRs, facilitating the expansion of test space in the robustness assessment. We have developed a search process and implemented four search algorithms: Single-GA, NSGA-II, SPEA2, and MOEA/D with novel encoding to solve the MR selection problem in the LLM robustness testing. We conducted comparative experiments on the four search algorithms along with a random search, using two major LLMs with primary Text-to-Text tasks. Our statistical and empirical investigation revealed two key findings: (1) the MOEA/D algorithm performed the best in optimizing the MR space for LLM robustness testing, and (2) we identified silver bullet MRs for the LLM robustness testing, which demonstrated dominant capabilities in confusing LLMs across different Text-to-Text tasks. In LLM robustness assessment, our research sheds light on the fundamental problem for optimized testing and provides insights into search-based solutions.

Abstract: Generative AI is transforming business applications by enabling natural language interfaces and intelligent automation. However, the underlying large language models (LLMs) are evolving rapidly and so prompting them consistently is a challenge. This leads to inconsistent and unpredictable application behavior, undermining the reliability that businesses require for mission-critical workflows. In this paper, we introduce the concept of prompt migration as a systematic approach to stabilizing GenAI applications amid changing LLMs. Using the Tursio enterprise search application as a case study, we analyze the impact of successive GPT model upgrades, detail our migration framework including prompt redesign and a migration testbed, and demonstrate how these techniques restore application consistency. Our results show that structured prompt migration can fully recover the application reliability that was lost due to model drift. We conclude with practical lessons learned, emphasizing the need for prompt lifecycle management and robust testing to ensure dependable GenAI-powered business applications.

Abstract: In this work we propose a unified Fourier Spectral Transformer network that integrates the strengths of classical spectral methods and attention based neural architectures. By transforming the original PDEs into spectral ordinary differential equations, we use high precision numerical solvers to generate training data and use a Transformer network to model the evolution of the spectral coefficients. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the two dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and the one dimensional Burgers' equation. The results show that our spectral Transformer can achieve highly accurate long term predictions even with limited training data, better than traditional numerical methods and machine learning methods in forecasting future flow dynamics. The proposed framework generalizes well to unseen data, bringing a promising paradigm for real time prediction and control of complex dynamical systems.

<title>Self-Review Framework for Enhancing Instruction Following Capability of LLM</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05598</link>

Abstract: Various techniques have been proposed to improve large language models (LLMs) adherence to formatting and instruction constraints. One of the most effective approaches involves utilizing high-quality data generated by powerful models. However, such models often fail to fully comply with complex instructions in a single generation. To address this limitation, iterative revision methods have been introduced. Nevertheless, as the number of data points and revision iterations increases, the associated monetary costs grow significantly. As a resource-efficient alternative, methods have been proposed that leverage high-performance evaluation tools to compensate for the limited self-evaluation capabilities of open-source LLMs. However, these approaches often lead to a degradation in output quality due to excessive revision. To overcome these challenges, we propose Re5, a self-evaluation and revision framework designed to enhance instruction-following performance while preserving the quality of the generated content. Re5 extracts task and constraint components from user instructions, performs structural evaluations to prevent error accumulation, and applies fine-grained constraint-specific content evaluations followed by selective revisions. This process ensures precise and quality-preserving improvements. The final high-quality outputs are used for alignment tuning, enabling long-term alignment improvements through a data-centric iterative refinement loop. Experimental results demonstrate that Re5 achieves instruction-following performance comparable to models trained on data generated by GPT-4o-mini, a high-performance model, even with a small amount of data while maintaining response quality with a 64.24%-win rate over the non-revised initial responses. These results validate Re5 as an efficient and effective solution for enhancing instruction adherence with minimal external supervision.

<title>DATABench: Evaluating Dataset Auditing in Deep Learning from an Adversarial Perspective</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05622</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: The widespread application of Deep Learning across diverse domains hinges critically on the quality and composition of training datasets. However, the common lack of disclosure regarding their usage raises significant privacy and copyright concerns. Dataset auditing techniques, which aim to determine if a specific dataset was used to train a given suspicious model, provide promising solutions to addressing these transparency gaps. While prior work has developed various auditing methods, their resilience against dedicated adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. To bridge the gap, this paper initiates a comprehensive study evaluating dataset auditing from an adversarial perspective. We start with introducing a novel taxonomy, classifying existing methods based on their reliance on internal features (IF) (inherent to the data) versus external features (EF) (artificially introduced for auditing). Subsequently, we formulate two primary attack types: evasion attacks, designed to conceal the use of a dataset, and forgery attacks, intending to falsely implicate an unused dataset. Building on the understanding of existing methods and attack objectives, we further propose systematic attack strategies: decoupling, removal, and detection for evasion; adversarial example-based methods for forgery. These formulations and strategies lead to our new benchmark, DATABench, comprising 17 evasion attacks, 5 forgery attacks, and 9 representative auditing methods. Extensive evaluations using DATABench reveal that none of the evaluated auditing methods are sufficiently robust or distinctive under adversarial settings. These findings underscore the urgent need for developing a more secure and reliable dataset auditing method capable of withstanding sophisticated adversarial manipulation. Code is available at https://github.com/shaoshuo-ss/DATABench.

<title>How Not to Detect Prompt Injections with an LLM</title>

Abstract: LLM-integrated applications and agents are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, in which adversaries embed malicious instructions within seemingly benign user inputs to manipulate the LLM's intended behavior. Recent defenses based on $\textit{known-answer detection}$ (KAD) have achieved near-perfect performance by using an LLM to classify inputs as clean or contaminated. In this work, we formally characterize the KAD framework and uncover a structural vulnerability in its design that invalidates its core security premise. We design a methodical adaptive attack, $\textit{DataFlip}$, to exploit this fundamental weakness. It consistently evades KAD defenses with detection rates as low as $1.5\%$ while reliably inducing malicious behavior with success rates of up to $88\%$, without needing white-box access to the LLM or any optimization procedures.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) extends large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge but faces key challenges: restricted effective context length and redundancy in retrieved documents. Pure compression-based approaches reduce input size but often discard fine-grained details essential for factual accuracy. We propose SARA, a unified RAG framework that balances local precision and global knowledge coverage under tight context budgets. SARA combines natural-language text snippets with semantic compression vectors to jointly enhance context efficiency and answer correctness. It represents contexts at two complementary levels: 1) fine-grained natural-language spans that preserve critical entities and numerical values, and 2) compact, interpretable vectors that summarize high-level semantics. An iterative evidence-selection module employs the compression vectors for dynamic reranking of contexts. Across 9 datasets and 5 open-source LLMs spanning 3 model families (Mistral, Llama, and Gemma), SARA consistently improves answer relevance (+17.71), answer correctness (+13.72), and semantic similarity (+15.53), demonstrating the importance of integrating textual and compressed representations for robust, context-efficient RAG.

Abstract: Graph learning has rapidly evolved into a critical subfield of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). Its development began with early graph-theoretic methods, gaining significant momentum with the advent of graph neural networks (GNNs). Over the past decade, progress in scalable architectures, dynamic graph modeling, multimodal learning, generative AI, explainable AI (XAI), and responsible AI has broadened the applicability of graph learning to various challenging environments. Graph learning is significant due to its ability to model complex, non-Euclidean relationships that traditional machine learning struggles to capture, thus better supporting real-world applications ranging from drug discovery and fraud detection to recommender systems and scientific reasoning. However, challenges like scalability, generalization, heterogeneity, interpretability, and trustworthiness must be addressed to unlock its full potential. This survey provides a comprehensive introduction to graph learning, focusing on key dimensions including scalable, temporal, multimodal, generative, explainable, and responsible graph learning. We review state-of-the-art techniques for efficiently handling large-scale graphs, capturing dynamic temporal dependencies, integrating heterogeneous data modalities, generating novel graph samples, and enhancing interpretability to foster trust and transparency. We also explore ethical considerations, such as privacy and fairness, to ensure responsible deployment of graph learning models. Additionally, we identify and discuss emerging topics, highlighting recent integration of graph learning and other AI paradigms and offering insights into future directions. This survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of graph learning.

<title>FACT: the Features At Convergence Theorem for neural networks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.05644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central challenge in deep learning theory is to understand how neural networks learn and represent features. To this end, we prove the Features at Convergence Theorem (FACT), which gives a self-consistency equation that neural network weights satisfy at convergence when trained with nonzero weight decay. For each weight matrix $W$, this equation relates the "feature matrix" $W^\top W$ to the set of input vectors passed into the matrix during forward propagation and the loss gradients passed through it during backpropagation. We validate this relation empirically, showing that neural features indeed satisfy the FACT at convergence. Furthermore, by modifying the "Recursive Feature Machines" of Radhakrishnan et al. 2024 so that they obey the FACT, we arrive at a new learning algorithm, FACT-RFM. FACT-RFM achieves high performance on tabular data and captures various feature learning behaviors that occur in neural network training, including grokking in modular arithmetic and phase transitions in learning sparse parities.

<title>DESIGN: Encrypted GNN Inference via Server-Side Input Graph Pruning</title>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various graph-based learning tasks. However, enabling privacy-preserving GNNs in encrypted domains, such as under Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), typically incurs substantial computational overhead, rendering real-time and privacy-preserving inference impractical. In this work, we propose DESIGN (EncrypteD GNN Inference via sErver-Side Input Graph pruNing), a novel framework for efficient encrypted GNN inference. DESIGN tackles the critical efficiency limitations of existing FHE GNN approaches, which often overlook input data redundancy and apply uniform computational strategies. Our framework achieves significant performance gains through a hierarchical optimization strategy executed entirely on the server: first, FHE-compatible node importance scores (based on encrypted degree statistics) are computed from the encrypted graph. These scores then guide a homomorphic partitioning process, generating multi-level importance masks directly under FHE. This dynamically generated mask facilitates both input graph pruning (by logically removing unimportant elements) and a novel adaptive polynomial activation scheme, where activation complexity is tailored to node importance levels. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that DESIGN substantially accelerates FHE GNN inference compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive model accuracy, presenting a robust solution for secure graph analytics.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models, such as LLMs, have revolutionized conversational AI. Chatbots are increasingly being developed by customizing LLMs on specific conversational datasets. However, mitigating toxicity during this customization, especially when dealing with untrusted training data, remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce TuneShield, a defense framework designed to mitigate toxicity during chatbot fine-tuning while preserving conversational quality. TuneShield leverages LLM-based toxicity classification, utilizing the instruction-following capabilities and safety alignment of LLMs to effectively identify toxic samples, outperforming industry API services. TuneShield generates synthetic conversation samples, termed 'healing data', based on the identified toxic samples, using them to mitigate toxicity while reinforcing desirable behavior during fine-tuning. It performs an alignment process to further nudge the chatbot towards producing desired responses. Our findings show that TuneShield effectively mitigates toxicity injection attacks while preserving conversational quality, even when the toxicity classifiers are imperfect or biased. TuneShield proves to be resilient against adaptive adversarial and jailbreak attacks. Additionally, TuneShield demonstrates effectiveness in mitigating adaptive toxicity injection attacks during dialog-based learning (DBL).

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have shown remarkable progress in open-domain settings, yet medical video generation remains largely underexplored. Medical videos are critical for applications such as clinical training, education, and simulation, requiring not only high visual fidelity but also strict medical accuracy. However, current models often produce unrealistic or erroneous content when applied to medical prompts, largely due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets tailored to the medical domain. To address this gap, we introduce MedVideoCap-55K, the first large-scale, diverse, and caption-rich dataset for medical video generation. It comprises over 55,000 curated clips spanning real-world medical scenarios, providing a strong foundation for training generalist medical video generation models. Built upon this dataset, we develop MedGen, which achieves leading performance among open-source models and rivals commercial systems across multiple benchmarks in both visual quality and medical accuracy. We hope our dataset and model can serve as a valuable resource and help catalyze further research in medical video generation.

Abstract: Clock meshes are essential in high-performance VLSI systems for minimizing skew and handling PVT variations, but analyzing them is difficult due to reconvergent paths, multi-source driving, and input mesh buffer skew. SPICE simulations are accurate but slow; yet simplified models miss key effects like slew and input skew. We propose GATMesh, a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based framework that models the clock mesh as a graph with augmented structural and physical features. Trained on SPICE data, GATMesh achieves high accuracy with average delay error of 5.27ps on unseen benchmarks, while achieving speed-ups of 47146x over multi-threaded SPICE simulation.

Abstract: The integration of Federated Learning (FL) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) presents a compelling pathway for training more powerful, large-scale artificial intelligence models (LAMs) on decentralized data while preserving privacy. However, efficient federated training of these complex MoE-structured LAMs is hindered by significant system-level challenges, particularly in managing the interplay between heterogeneous client resources and the sophisticated coordination required for numerous specialized experts. This article highlights a critical, yet underexplored concept: the absence of robust quantitative strategies for dynamic client-expert alignment that holistically considers varying client capacities and the imperative for system-wise load balancing. Specifically, we propose a conceptual system design for intelligent client-expert alignment that incorporates dynamic fitness scoring, global expert load monitoring, and client capacity profiling. By tackling these systemic issues, we can unlock more scalable, efficient, and robust training mechanisms {with fewer communication rounds for convergence}, paving the way for the widespread deployment of large-scale federated MoE-structured LAMs in edge computing with ultra-high communication efficiency.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a widely adopted approach for improving the factuality of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge at inference time. Although there exist multiple RAG benchmarks for English, evaluation resources for other languages, including Russian, remain scarce and static, failing to capture the dynamic nature of real-world deployments.
  In this work, we present DRAGON (Dynamic RAG Benchmark On News), the first dynamic benchmark for evaluating RAG systems in Russian on a changing news corpora. DRAGON is built upon a regularly updated corpus of Russian news and public documents and supports comprehensive evaluation of both the retriever and generator components. Question generation is performed automatically with the use of Knowledge Graph constructed from the corpus and enables the extraction of four core question types aligned with distinct subgraph patterns. We release a complete evaluation framework comprising the pipeline for automatic question generation, evaluation scripts, which are potentially reusable for other languages and multilingual settings, and benchmark data. We also launch a public leaderboard to encourage community participation and comparison.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a fundamental paradigm for addressing the challenges faced by large language models in handling real-time information and domain-specific problems. Traditional RAG systems primarily rely on the in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of the large language model itself. Still, in-depth research on the specific capabilities needed by the RAG generation model is lacking, leading to challenges with inconsistent document quality and retrieval system imperfections. Even the limited studies that fine-tune RAG generative models often \textit{lack a granular focus on RAG task} or \textit{a deeper utilization of chain-of-thought processes}. To address this, we propose that RAG models should possess three progressively hierarchical abilities (1) Filtering: the ability to select relevant information; (2) Combination: the ability to combine semantic information across paragraphs; and (3) RAG-specific reasoning: the ability to further process external knowledge using internal knowledge. Thus, we introduce our new RAG instruction fine-tuning method, Hierarchical-Thought Instruction-Tuning Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HIRAG) incorporates a "think before answering" strategy. This method enhances the model's open-book examination capability by utilizing multi-level progressive chain-of-thought. Experiments show that the HIRAG training strategy significantly improves the model's performance on datasets such as RGB, PopQA, MuSiQue, HotpotQA, and PubmedQA.

Abstract: Mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures have expanded from language modeling to automatic speech recognition (ASR). Traditional MoE methods, such as the Switch Transformer, route experts independently within each layer. Our analysis reveals that routers in most layers make expert choices that are not strongly correlated with the choices of the routers in other layers. To increase the cooperation between experts in different layers and encourage greater specialization, we use a shared router across different MoE layers. We call this model \emph{Omni-router Transformer}. Extensive experiments on a large-scale pseudo-labeled dataset and evaluations across 10 diverse, out-of-domain ASR benchmarks demonstrate that the Omni-router Transformer is able to achieve lower training loss and consistently outperform dense and Switch Transformer models, reducing average word error rates by 11.2% and 8.2%, respectively, while providing structured expert usage and improved robustness to diverse data.

Abstract: Hyperspectral images are high-dimensional datasets consisting of hundreds of contiguous spectral bands, enabling detailed material and surface analysis. Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) refers to the technique of identifying and locating anomalous targets in such data without prior information about a hyperspectral scene or target spectrum. This technology has seen rapid advancements in recent years, with applications in agriculture, defence, military surveillance, and environmental monitoring. Despite this significant progress, existing HAD methods continue to face challenges such as high computational complexity, sensitivity to noise, and limited generalisation across diverse datasets. This study presents a comprehensive comparison of various HAD techniques, categorising them into statistical models, representation-based methods, classical machine learning approaches, and deep learning models. We evaluated these methods across 17 benchmarking datasets using different performance metrics, such as ROC, AUC, and separability map to analyse detection accuracy, computational efficiency, their strengths, limitations, and directions for future research.The research shows that deep learning models achieved the highest detection accuracy, while statistical models demonstrated exceptional speed across all datasets. This study aims to provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners working to advance the field of hyperspectral anomaly detection methods.

Abstract: Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) unleash powerful analysis capabilities for low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite Earth observation images in the data center. However, fast satellite motion, brief satellite-ground station (GS) contact windows, and large size of the images pose a data download challenge. To enable near real-time Earth observation applications (e.g., disaster and extreme weather monitoring), we should explore how to deploy LVLM in LEO satellite networks, and design SpaceVerse, an efficient satellite-ground synergistic LVLM inference system. To this end, firstly, we deploy compact LVLMs on satellites for lightweight tasks, whereas regular LVLMs operate on GSs to handle computationally intensive tasks. Then, we propose a computing and communication co-design framework comprised of a progressive confidence network and an attention-based multi-scale preprocessing, used to identify on-satellite inferring data, and reduce data redundancy before satellite-GS transmission, separately. We implement and evaluate SpaceVerse on real-world LEO satellite constellations and datasets, achieving a 31.2% average gain in accuracy and a 51.2% reduction in latency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

<title>When Transformers Meet Recommenders: Integrating Self-Attentive Sequential Recommendation with Fine-Tuned LLMs</title>

Abstract: Self-Attentive Sequential Recommendation (SASRec) effectively captures long-term user preferences by applying attention mechanisms to historical interactions. Concurrently, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has motivated research into LLM-based recommendation, which leverages their powerful generalization and language understanding capabilities. However, LLMs often lack the domain-specific knowledge and collaborative signals essential for high-quality recommendations when relying solely on textual prompts. To address this limitation, this study proposes SASRecLLM, a novel framework that integrates SASRec as a collaborative encoder with an LLM fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The components are connected via a mapping layer to align their dimensional spaces, and three targeted training strategies are designed to optimize the hybrid architecture. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that SASRecLLM achieves robust and consistent improvements over strong baselines in both cold-start and warm-start scenarios. This work advances the field of LLM-based recommendation by presenting a modular and effective paradigm for fusing structured collaborative filtering with the semantic power of fine-tuned LLMs. The implementation is available on GitHub: https://github.com/kechenkristin/RecLLM

Abstract: A principal barrier to large-scale deployment of urban autonomous driving systems lies in the prevalence of complex scenarios and edge cases. Existing systems fail to effectively interpret semantic information within traffic contexts and discern intentions of other participants, consequently generating decisions misaligned with skilled drivers' reasoning patterns. We present LeAD, a dual-rate autonomous driving architecture integrating imitation learning-based end-to-end (E2E) frameworks with large language model (LLM) augmentation. The high-frequency E2E subsystem maintains real-time perception-planning-control cycles, while the low-frequency LLM module enhances scenario comprehension through multi-modal perception fusion with HD maps and derives optimal decisions via chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning when baseline planners encounter capability limitations. Our experimental evaluation in the CARLA Simulator demonstrates LeAD's superior handling of unconventional scenarios, achieving 71 points on Leaderboard V1 benchmark, with a route completion of 93%.

Abstract: For securing systems, it is essential to manage their vulnerability posture and design appropriate security controls. Vulnerability management allows to proactively address vulnerabilities by incorporating pertinent security controls into systems designs. Current vulnerability management approaches do not support systematic reasoning about the vulnerability postures of systems designs. To effectively manage vulnerabilities and design security controls, we propose a formally grounded automated reasoning mechanism. We integrate the mechanism into an open-source security design tool and demonstrate its application through an illustrative example driven by real-world challenges. The automated reasoning mechanism allows system designers to identify vulnerabilities that are applicable to a specific system design, explicitly specify vulnerability mitigation options, declare selected controls, and thus systematically manage vulnerability postures.

Abstract: While concept-based interpretability methods have traditionally focused on local explanations of neural network predictions, we propose a novel framework and interactive tool that extends these methods into the domain of mechanistic interpretability. Our approach enables a global dissection of model behavior by analyzing how high-level semantic attributes (referred to as concepts) emerge, interact, and propagate through internal model components. Unlike prior work that isolates individual neurons or predictions, our framework systematically quantifies how semantic concepts are represented across layers, revealing latent circuits and information flow that underlie model decision-making. A key innovation is our visualization platform that we named BAGEL (for Bias Analysis with a Graph for global Explanation Layers), which presents these insights in a structured knowledge graph, allowing users to explore concept-class relationships, identify spurious correlations, and enhance model trustworthiness. Our framework is model-agnostic, scalable, and contributes to a deeper understanding of how deep learning models generalize (or fail to) in the presence of dataset biases. The demonstration is available at https://knowledge-graph-ui-4a7cb5.gitlab.io/.

Abstract: The development of safe and robust autonomous driving functions is heavily dependent on large-scale, high-quality sensor data. However, real-word data acquisition demands intensive human labor and is strongly limited by factors such as labeling cost, driver safety protocols and diverse scenario coverage. Thus, multiple lines of work focus on the conditional generation of synthetic camera sensor data. We identify a significant gap in research regarding daytime variation, presumably caused by the scarcity of available labels. Consequently, we present the solar altitude as global conditioning variable. It is readily computable from latitude-longitude coordinates and local time, eliminating the need for extensive manual labeling. Our work is complemented by a tailored normalization approach, targeting the sensitivity of daylight towards small numeric changes in altitude. We demonstrate its ability to accurately capture lighting characteristics and illumination-dependent image noise in the context of diffusion models.

Abstract: As critical transportation infrastructure, bridges face escalating challenges from aging and deterioration, while traditional manual inspection methods suffer from low efficiency. Although 3D point cloud technology provides a new data-driven paradigm, its application potential is often constrained by the incompleteness of real-world data, which results from missing labels and scanning occlusions. To overcome the bottleneck of insufficient generalization in existing synthetic data methods, this paper proposes a systematic framework for generating 3D bridge data.
  This framework can automatically generate complete point clouds featuring component-level instance annotations, high-fidelity color, and precise normal vectors. It can be further extended to simulate the creation of diverse and physically realistic incomplete point clouds, designed to support the training of segmentation and completion networks, respectively. Experiments demonstrate that a PointNet++ model trained with our synthetic data achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 84.2% in real-world bridge semantic segmentation. Concurrently, a fine-tuned KT-Net exhibits superior performance on the component completion task.
  This research offers an innovative methodology and a foundational dataset for the 3D visual analysis of bridge structures, holding significant implications for advancing the automated management and maintenance of infrastructure.

Abstract: Creating a cast of characters by attending to their relational dynamics is a critical aspect of most long-form storywriting. However, our formative study (N=14) reveals that writers struggle to envision new characters that could influence existing ones, to balance similarities and differences among characters, and to intricately flesh out their relationships. Based on these observations, we designed Constella, an LLM-based multi-agent tool that supports storywriters' interconnected character creation process. Constella suggests related characters (FRIENDS DISCOVERY feature), reveals the inner mindscapes of several characters simultaneously (JOURNALS feature), and manifests relationships through inter-character responses (COMMENTS feature). Our 7-8 day deployment study with storywriters (N=11) shows that Constella enabled the creation of expansive communities composed of related characters, facilitated the comparison of characters' thoughts and emotions, and deepened writers' understanding of character relationships. We conclude by discussing how multi-agent interactions can help distribute writers' attention and effort across the character cast.

Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained mobile devices presents significant challenges, particularly in achieving real-time performance while simultaneously coping with limited computational resources and battery life. While Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) offers collaborative inference with GPU servers as a promising solution, existing approaches primarily rely on layer-wise model partitioning and undergo significant transmission bottlenecks caused by the sequential execution of DNN operations. To address this challenge, we present Intra-DP, a high-performance collaborative inference system optimized for DNN inference on MEC. Intra DP employs a novel parallel computing technique based on local operators (i.e., operators whose minimum unit input is not the entire input tensor, such as the convolution kernel). By decomposing their computations (operations) into several independent sub-operations and overlapping the computation and transmission of different sub-operations through parallel execution, Intra-DP mitigates transmission bottlenecks in MEC, achieving fast and energy-efficient inference. The evaluation demonstrates that Intra-DP reduces per-inference latency by up to 50% and energy consumption by up to 75% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle navigation in unstructured environments, such as forests and mountainous regions, presents significant challenges due to irregular terrain and complex road conditions. This work provides a comparative evaluation of mainstream and well-established path planning algorithms applied to weighted pixel-level road networks derived from high-resolution satellite imagery and airborne LiDAR data. For 2D road-map navigation, where the weights reflect road conditions and terrain difficulty, A*, Dijkstra, RRT*, and a Novel Improved Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm (NIACO) are tested on the DeepGlobe satellite dataset. For 3D road-map path planning, 3D A*, 3D Dijkstra, RRT-Connect, and NIACO are evaluated using the Hamilton airborne LiDAR dataset, which provides detailed elevation information. All algorithms are assessed under identical start and end point conditions, focusing on path cost, computation time, and memory consumption. Results demonstrate that Dijkstra consistently offers the most stable and efficient performance in both 2D and 3D scenarios, particularly when operating on dense, pixel-level geospatial road-maps. These findings highlight the reliability of Dijkstra-based planning for static terrain navigation and establish a foundation for future research on dynamic path planning under complex environmental constraints.

<title>Hierarchy or Heterarchy? A Theory of Long-Range Connections for the Sensorimotor Brain</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05888</link>

arXiv:2507.05888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the traditional understanding of the neocortex, sensory information flows up a hierarchy of regions, with each level processing increasingly complex features. Information also flows down the hierarchy via a different set of connections. Although the hierarchical model has significant support, many anatomical connections do not conform to the standard hierarchical interpretation. In addition, hierarchically arranged regions sometimes respond in parallel, not sequentially as would occur in a hierarchy. This and other evidence suggests that two regions can act in parallel and hierarchically at the same time. Given this flexibility, the word "heterarchy" might be a more suitable term to describe neocortical organization. This paper proposes a new interpretation of how sensory and motor information is processed in the neocortex. The key to our proposal is what we call the "Thousand Brains Theory", which posits that every cortical column is a sensorimotor learning system. Columns learn by integrating sensory input over multiple movements of a sensor. In this view, even primary and secondary regions, such as V1 and V2, can learn and recognize complete 3D objects. This suggests that the hierarchical connections between regions are used to learn the compositional structure of parent objects composed of smaller child objects. We explain the theory by examining the different types of long-range connections between cortical regions and between the neocortex and thalamus. We describe these connections, and then suggest the specific roles they play in the context of a heterarchy of sensorimotor regions. We also suggest that the thalamus plays an essential role in transforming the pose between objects and sensors. The novel perspective we argue for here has broad implications for both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

<title>Psychometric Item Validation Using Virtual Respondents with Trait-Response Mediators</title>

Abstract: As psychometric surveys are increasingly used to assess the traits of large language models (LLMs), the need for scalable survey item generation suited for LLMs has also grown. A critical challenge here is ensuring the construct validity of generated items, i.e., whether they truly measure the intended trait. Traditionally, this requires costly, large-scale human data collection. To make it efficient, we present a framework for virtual respondent simulation using LLMs. Our central idea is to account for mediators: factors through which the same trait can give rise to varying responses to a survey item. By simulating respondents with diverse mediators, we identify survey items that robustly measure intended traits. Experiments on three psychological trait theories (Big5, Schwartz, VIA) show that our mediator generation methods and simulation framework effectively identify high-validity items. LLMs demonstrate the ability to generate plausible mediators from trait definitions and to simulate respondent behavior for item validation. Our problem formulation, metrics, methodology, and dataset open a new direction for cost-effective survey development and a deeper understanding of how LLMs replicate human-like behavior. We will publicly release our dataset and code to support future work.

Abstract: Tabular data in relational databases represents a significant portion of industrial data. Hence, analyzing and interpreting tabular data is of utmost importance. Application tasks on tabular data are manifold and are often not specified when setting up an industrial database. To address this, we present a novel framework for generating universal, i.e., task-independent embeddings of tabular data for performing downstream tasks without predefined targets. Our method transforms tabular data into a graph structure, leverages Graph Auto-Encoders to create entity embeddings, which are subsequently aggregated to obtain embeddings for each table row, i.e., each data sample. This two-step approach has the advantage that unseen samples, consisting of similar entities, can be embedded without additional training. Downstream tasks such as regression, classification or outlier detection, can then be performed by applying a distance-based similarity measure in the embedding space. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing universal tabular data embedding techniques.

Abstract: This survey provides a comparative analysis of feature-based and GAN-based approaches to learning from demonstrations, with a focus on the structure of reward functions and their implications for policy learning. Feature-based methods offer dense, interpretable rewards that excel at high-fidelity motion imitation, yet often require sophisticated representations of references and struggle with generalization in unstructured settings. GAN-based methods, in contrast, use implicit, distributional supervision that enables scalability and adaptation flexibility, but are prone to training instability and coarse reward signals. Recent advancements in both paradigms converge on the importance of structured motion representations, which enable smoother transitions, controllable synthesis, and improved task integration. We argue that the dichotomy between feature-based and GAN-based methods is increasingly nuanced: rather than one paradigm dominating the other, the choice should be guided by task-specific priorities such as fidelity, diversity, interpretability, and adaptability. This work outlines the algorithmic trade-offs and design considerations that underlie method selection, offering a framework for principled decision-making in learning from demonstrations.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Differentiable Reward Optimization (DiffRO) method aimed at enhancing the performance of neural codec language models based text-to-speech (TTS) systems. In contrast to conventional reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) approaches applied to TTS, DiffRO directly compute the rewards based on neural codec tokens, rather than relying on synthesized audio. Furthermore, we employ the Gumbel-Softmax technique to render the reward function differentiable, thereby streamlining the RLHF training process. Additionally, we introduce a multi-task reward (MTR) model which can provide feedback from different perspectives and find that it can augment the system's capability to follow instructions effectively.Experimental results indicate that DiffRO significantly improves the pronunciation accuracy of the TTS system, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) WER results on the seed-tts-eval benchmark. Moreover, with the integration of the MTR model, we demonstrate the ability to control emotional and quality attributes in a zero-shot manner.

Abstract: The development of explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) methods for scene classification problems has attracted great attention in remote sensing (RS). Most xAI methods and the related evaluation metrics in RS are initially developed for natural images considered in computer vision (CV), and their direct usage in RS may not be suitable. To address this issue, in this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of explanation methods and metrics in the context of RS image scene classification. In detail, we methodologically and experimentally analyze ten explanation metrics spanning five categories (faithfulness, robustness, localization, complexity, randomization), applied to five established feature attribution methods (Occlusion, LIME, GradCAM, LRP, and DeepLIFT) across three RS datasets. Our methodological analysis identifies key limitations in both explanation methods and metrics. The performance of perturbation-based methods, such as Occlusion and LIME, heavily depends on perturbation baselines and spatial characteristics of RS scenes. Gradient-based approaches like GradCAM struggle when multiple labels are present in the same image, while some relevance propagation methods (LRP) can distribute relevance disproportionately relative to the spatial extent of classes. Analogously, we find limitations in evaluation metrics. Faithfulness metrics share the same problems as perturbation-based methods. Localization metrics and complexity metrics are unreliable for classes with a large spatial extent. In contrast, robustness metrics and randomization metrics consistently exhibit greater stability. Our experimental results support these methodological findings. Based on our analysis, we provide guidelines for selecting explanation methods, metrics, and hyperparameters in the context of RS image scene classification.

Abstract: We introduce OpenFActScore, an open-source implementation of the FActScore framework for evaluating the factuality of text generated by large language models (LLMs). FActScore evaluates the factual accuracy of long-form text by using Atomic Fact Generation (AFG) to extract individual factual claims and Atomic Fact Validation (AFV) to verify each claim against a trusted knowledge source. While the original FActScore relies on closed-source and commercial models such as InstructGPT and ChatGPT, OpenFActScore enables the use of any Hugging Face-compatible model for both AFG and AFV. We provide a detailed technical overview of our implementation, highlighting design choices and modifications made to support open models. We evaluate multiple open-source LLMs on both AFG and AFV using the original FActScore benchmark, reporting BERTScore-F1 for AFG and Error Rate relative to human annotations for AFV. Our results show that open models can approximate the performance of closed-source systems, with Gemma achieving the best overall performance, and our final setup obtains a 0.99 Pearson correlation with the original FActScore experiments. OpenFActScore promotes transparency, reproducibility, and cost-effective evaluation, and is available at: https://github.com/lflage/OpenFActScore.

<title>Simple Convergence Proof of Adam From a Sign-like Descent Perspective</title>

Abstract: Adam is widely recognized as one of the most effective optimizers for training deep neural networks (DNNs). Despite its remarkable empirical success, its theoretical convergence analysis remains unsatisfactory. Existing works predominantly interpret Adam as a preconditioned stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM), formulated as $\bm{x}_{t+1} = \bm{x}_t - \frac{\gamma_t}{{\sqrt{\bm{v}_t}+\epsilon}} \circ \bm{m}_t$. This perspective necessitates strong assumptions and intricate techniques, resulting in lengthy and opaque convergence proofs that are difficult to verify and extend. In contrast, we propose a novel interpretation by treating Adam as a sign-like optimizer, expressed as $\bm{x}_{t+1} = \bm{x}_t - \gamma_t \frac{|\bm{m}_t|}{{\sqrt{\bm{v}_t}+\epsilon}} \circ {\rm Sign}(\bm{m}_t)$. This reformulation significantly simplifies the convergence analysis. For the first time, with some mild conditions, we prove that Adam achieves the optimal rate of ${\cal O}(\frac{1}{T^{\sfrac{1}{4}}})$ rather than the previous ${\cal O} \left(\frac{\ln T}{T^{\sfrac{1}{4}}}\right)$ under weak assumptions of the generalized $p$-affine variance and $(L_0, L_1, q)$-smoothness, without dependence on the model dimensionality or the numerical stability parameter $\epsilon$. Additionally, our theoretical analysis provides new insights into the role of momentum as a key factor ensuring convergence and offers practical guidelines for tuning learning rates in Adam, further bridging the gap between theory and practice.

Abstract: Partial multi-label learning aims to extract knowledge from incompletely annotated data, which includes known correct labels, known incorrect labels, and unknown labels. The core challenge lies in accurately identifying the ambiguous relationships between labels and instances. In this paper, we emphasize that matching co-occurrence patterns between labels and instances is key to addressing this challenge. To this end, we propose Semantic Co-occurrence Insight Network (SCINet), a novel and effective framework for partial multi-label learning. Specifically, SCINet introduces a bi-dominant prompter module, which leverages an off-the-shelf multimodal model to capture text-image correlations and enhance semantic alignment. To reinforce instance-label interdependencies, we develop a cross-modality fusion module that jointly models inter-label correlations, inter-instance relationships, and co-occurrence patterns across instance-label assignments. Moreover, we propose an intrinsic semantic augmentation strategy that enhances the model's understanding of intrinsic data semantics by applying diverse image transformations, thereby fostering a synergistic relationship between label confidence and sample difficulty. Extensive experiments on four widely-used benchmark datasets demonstrate that SCINet surpasses state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Geo-Registration of Terrestrial LiDAR Point Clouds with Satellite Images without GNSS</title>

Abstract: Accurate geo-registration of LiDAR point clouds presents significant challenges in GNSS signal denied urban areas with high-rise buildings and bridges. Existing methods typically rely on real-time GNSS and IMU data, that require pre-calibration and assume stable positioning during data collection. However, this assumption often fails in dense urban areas, resulting in localization errors. To address this, we propose a structured geo-registration and spatial correction method that aligns 3D point clouds with satellite images, enabling frame-wise recovery of GNSS information and reconstruction of city scale 3D maps without relying on prior localization. The proposed approach employs a pre-trained Point Transformer model to segment the road points and then extracts the road skeleton and intersection points from the point cloud as well as the target map for alignment. Global rigid alignment of the two is performed using the intersection points, followed by local refinement using radial basis function (RBF) interpolation. Elevation correction is then applied to the point cloud based on terrain information from SRTM dataset to resolve vertical discrepancies. The proposed method was tested on the popular KITTI benchmark and a locally collected Perth (Western Australia) CBD dataset. On the KITTI dataset, our method achieved an average planimetric alignment standard deviation (STD) of 0.84~m across sequences with intersections, representing a 55.3\% improvement over the original dataset. On the Perth dataset, which lacks GNSS information, our method achieved an average STD of 0.96~m compared to the GPS data extracted from Google Maps API. This corresponds to a 77.4\% improvement from the initial alignment. Our method also resulted in elevation correlation gains of 30.5\% on the KITTI dataset and 50.4\% on the Perth dataset.

<title>The Impact of Event Data Partitioning on Privacy-aware Process Discovery</title>

Abstract: Information systems support the execution of business processes. The event logs of these executions generally contain sensitive information about customers, patients, and employees. The corresponding privacy challenges can be addressed by anonymizing the event logs while still retaining utility for process discovery. However, trading off utility and privacy is difficult: the higher the complexity of event log, the higher the loss of utility by anonymization. In this work, we propose a pipeline that combines anonymization and event data partitioning, where event abstraction is utilized for partitioning. By leveraging event abstraction, event logs can be segmented into multiple parts, allowing each sub-log to be anonymized separately. This pipeline preserves privacy while mitigating the loss of utility. To validate our approach, we study the impact of event partitioning on two anonymization techniques using three real-world event logs and two process discovery techniques. Our results demonstrate that event partitioning can bring improvements in process discovery utility for directly-follows-based anonymization techniques.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a compelling methodology for the management of distributed data, marked by significant advancements in recent years. In this paper, we propose an efficient FL approach that capitalizes on additional downlink bandwidth resources to ensure timely update dissemination. Initially, we implement this strategy within an asynchronous framework, introducing the Asynchronous Staleness-aware Model Update (FedASMU), which integrates both server-side and device-side methodologies. On the server side, we present an asynchronous FL system model that employs a dynamic model aggregation technique, which harmonizes local model updates with the global model to enhance both accuracy and efficiency. Concurrently, on the device side, we propose an adaptive model adjustment mechanism that integrates the latest global model with local models during training to further elevate accuracy. Subsequently, we extend this approach to a synchronous context, referred to as FedSSMU. Theoretical analyses substantiate the convergence of our proposed methodologies. Extensive experiments, encompassing six models and five public datasets, demonstrate that FedASMU and FedSSMU significantly surpass baseline methods in terms of both accuracy (up to 145.87%) and efficiency (up to 97.59%).

<title>TextPixs: Glyph-Conditioned Diffusion with Character-Aware Attention and OCR-Guided Supervision</title>

Abstract: The modern text-to-image diffusion models boom has opened a new era in digital content production as it has proven the previously unseen ability to produce photorealistic and stylistically diverse imagery based on the semantics of natural-language descriptions. However, the consistent disadvantage of these models is that they cannot generate readable, meaningful, and correctly spelled text in generated images, which significantly limits the use of practical purposes like advertising, learning, and creative design. This paper introduces a new framework, namely Glyph-Conditioned Diffusion with Character-Aware Attention (GCDA), using which a typical diffusion backbone is extended by three well-designed modules. To begin with, the model has a dual-stream text encoder that encodes both semantic contextual information and explicit glyph representations, resulting in a character-aware representation of the input text that is rich in nature. Second, an attention mechanism that is aware of the character is proposed with a new attention segregation loss that aims to limit the attention distribution of each character independently in order to avoid distortion artifacts. Lastly, GCDA has an OCR-in-the-loop fine-tuning phase, where a full text perceptual loss, directly optimises models to be legible and accurately spell. Large scale experiments to benchmark datasets, such as MARIO-10M and T2I-CompBench, reveal that GCDA sets a new state-of-the-art on all metrics, with better character based metrics on text rendering (Character Error Rate: 0.08 vs 0.21 for the previous best; Word Error Rate: 0.15 vs 0.25), human perception, and comparable image synthesis quality on high-fidelity (FID: 14.3).

Abstract: Security alignment enables the Large Language Model (LLM) to gain the protection against malicious queries, but various jailbreak attack methods reveal the vulnerability of this security mechanism. Previous studies have isolated LLM jailbreak attacks and defenses. We analyze the security protection mechanism of the LLM, and propose a framework that combines attack and defense. Our method is based on the linearly separable property of LLM intermediate layer embedding, as well as the essence of jailbreak attack, which aims to embed harmful problems and transfer them to the safe area. We utilize generative adversarial network (GAN) to learn the security judgment boundary inside the LLM to achieve efficient jailbreak attack and defense. The experimental results indicate that our method achieves an average jailbreak success rate of 88.85\% across three popular LLMs, while the defense success rate on the state-of-the-art jailbreak dataset reaches an average of 84.17\%. This not only validates the effectiveness of our approach but also sheds light on the internal security mechanisms of LLMs, offering new insights for enhancing model security The code and data are available at https://github.com/NLPGM/CAVGAN.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to memorize portions of their training data, sometimes reproducing content verbatim when prompted appropriately. In this work, we investigate a fundamental yet under-explored question in the domain of memorization: How to characterize memorization difficulty of training data in LLMs? Through empirical experiments on OLMo, a family of open models, we present the Entropy-Memorization Law. It suggests that data entropy is linearly correlated with memorization score. Moreover, in a case study of memorizing highly randomized strings, or "gibberish", we observe that such sequences, despite their apparent randomness, exhibit unexpectedly low empirical entropy compared to the broader training corpus. Adopting the same strategy to discover Entropy-Memorization Law, we derive a simple yet effective approach to distinguish training and testing data, enabling Dataset Inference (DI).

Abstract: Realistic, high-fidelity 3D facial animations are crucial for expressive avatar systems in human-computer interaction and accessibility. Although prior methods show promising quality, their reliance on the mesh domain limits their ability to fully leverage the rapid visual innovations seen in 2D computer vision and graphics. We propose VisualSpeaker, a novel method that bridges this gap using photorealistic differentiable rendering, supervised by visual speech recognition, for improved 3D facial animation. Our contribution is a perceptual lip-reading loss, derived by passing photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting avatar renders through a pre-trained Visual Automatic Speech Recognition model during training. Evaluation on the MEAD dataset demonstrates that VisualSpeaker improves both the standard Lip Vertex Error metric by 56.1% and the perceptual quality of the generated animations, while retaining the controllability of mesh-driven animation. This perceptual focus naturally supports accurate mouthings, essential cues that disambiguate similar manual signs in sign language avatars.

<title>Enhancing Synthetic CT from CBCT via Multimodal Fusion and End-To-End Registration</title>

Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is widely used for intraoperative imaging due to its rapid acquisition and low radiation dose. However, CBCT images typically suffer from artifacts and lower visual quality compared to conventional Computed Tomography (CT). A promising solution is synthetic CT (sCT) generation, where CBCT volumes are translated into the CT domain. In this work, we enhance sCT generation through multimodal learning by jointly leveraging intraoperative CBCT and preoperative CT data. To overcome the inherent misalignment between modalities, we introduce an end-to-end learnable registration module within the sCT pipeline. This model is evaluated on a controlled synthetic dataset, allowing precise manipulation of data quality and alignment parameters. Further, we validate its robustness and generalizability on two real-world clinical datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating registration in multimodal sCT generation improves sCT quality, outperforming baseline multimodal methods in 79 out of 90 evaluation settings. Notably, the improvement is most significant in cases where CBCT quality is low and the preoperative CT is moderately misaligned.

Abstract: Recent advances in song identification leverage deep neural networks to learn compact audio fingerprints directly from raw waveforms. While these methods perform well under controlled conditions, their accuracy drops significantly in real-world scenarios where the audio is captured via mobile devices in noisy environments. In this paper, we introduce a novel evaluation protocol designed to better reflect such real-world conditions. We generate three recordings of the same audio, each with increasing levels of noise, captured using a mobile device's microphone. Our results reveal a substantial performance drop for two state-of-the-art CNN-based models under this protocol, compared to previously reported benchmarks. Additionally, we highlight the critical role of the augmentation pipeline during training with contrastive loss. By introduction low pass and high pass filters in the augmentation pipeline we significantly increase the performance of both systems in our proposed evaluation. Furthermore, we develop a transformer-based model with a tailored projection module and demonstrate that transferring knowledge from a semantically relevant domain yields a more robust solution. The transformer architecture outperforms CNN-based models across all noise levels, and query durations. In low noise conditions it achieves 47.99% for 1-sec queries, and 97% for 10-sec queries in finding the correct song, surpassing by 14%, and by 18.5% the second-best performing model, respectively, Under heavy noise levels, we achieve a detection rate 56.5% for 15-second query duration. All experiments are conducted on public large-scale dataset of over 100K songs, with queries matched against a database of 56 million vectors.

Abstract: Structured State Space models (SSM) have recently emerged as a new class of deep learning models, particularly well-suited for processing long sequences. Their constant memory footprint, in contrast to the linearly scaling memory demands of Transformers, makes them attractive candidates for deployment on resource-constrained edge-computing devices. While recent works have explored the effect of quantization-aware training (QAT) on SSMs, they typically do not address its implications for specialized edge hardware, for example, analog in-memory computing (AIMC) chips. In this work, we demonstrate that QAT can significantly reduce the complexity of SSMs by up to two orders of magnitude across various performance metrics. We analyze the relation between model size and numerical precision, and show that QAT enhances robustness to analog noise and enables structural pruning. Finally, we integrate these techniques to deploy SSMs on a memristive analog in-memory computing substrate and highlight the resulting benefits in terms of computational efficiency.

Abstract: Machine learning-based supervised classifiers are widely used for security tasks, and their improvement has been largely focused on algorithmic advancements. We argue that data challenges that negatively impact the performance of these classifiers have received limited attention. We address the following research question: Can developments in Generative AI (GenAI) address these data challenges and improve classifier performance? We propose augmenting training datasets with synthetic data generated using GenAI techniques to improve classifier generalization. We evaluate this approach across 7 diverse security tasks using 6 state-of-the-art GenAI methods and introduce a novel GenAI scheme called Nimai that enables highly controlled data synthesis. We find that GenAI techniques can significantly improve the performance of security classifiers, achieving improvements of up to 32.6% even in severely data-constrained settings (only ~180 training samples). Furthermore, we demonstrate that GenAI can facilitate rapid adaptation to concept drift post-deployment, requiring minimal labeling in the adjustment process. Despite successes, our study finds that some GenAI schemes struggle to initialize (train and produce data) on certain security tasks. We also identify characteristics of specific tasks, such as noisy labels, overlapping class distributions, and sparse feature vectors, which hinder performance boost using GenAI. We believe that our study will drive the development of future GenAI tools designed for security tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled real-time novel view synthesis (NVS) with impressive quality in indoor scenes. However, achieving high-fidelity rendering requires meticulously captured images covering the entire scene, limiting accessibility for general users. We aim to develop a practical 3DGS-based NVS framework using simple panorama-style motion with a handheld camera (e.g., mobile device). While convenient, this rotation-dominant motion and narrow baseline make accurate camera pose and 3D point estimation challenging, especially in textureless indoor scenes. To address these challenges, we propose LighthouseGS, a novel framework inspired by the lighthouse-like sweeping motion of panoramic views. LighthouseGS leverages rough geometric priors, such as mobile device camera poses and monocular depth estimation, and utilizes the planar structures often found in indoor environments. We present a new initialization method called plane scaffold assembly to generate consistent 3D points on these structures, followed by a stable pruning strategy to enhance geometry and optimization stability. Additionally, we introduce geometric and photometric corrections to resolve inconsistencies from motion drift and auto-exposure in mobile devices. Tested on collected real and synthetic indoor scenes, LighthouseGS delivers photorealistic rendering, surpassing state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating the potential for panoramic view synthesis and object placement.

Abstract: Automatic speech quality assessment plays a crucial role in the development of speech synthesis systems, but existing models exhibit significant performance variations across different granularity levels of prediction tasks. This paper proposes an enhanced MOS prediction system based on self-supervised learning speech models, incorporating a Mixture of Experts (MoE) classification head and utilizing synthetic data from multiple commercial generation models for data augmentation. Our method builds upon existing self-supervised models such as wav2vec2, designing a specialized MoE architecture to address different types of speech quality assessment tasks. We also collected a large-scale synthetic speech dataset encompassing the latest text-to-speech, speech conversion, and speech enhancement systems. However, despite the adoption of the MoE architecture and expanded dataset, the model's performance improvements in sentence-level prediction tasks remain limited. Our work reveals the limitations of current methods in handling sentence-level quality assessment, provides new technical pathways for the field of automatic speech quality assessment, and also delves into the fundamental causes of performance differences across different assessment granularities.

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimization addresses problems where gradient information is inaccessible or impractical to compute. While most existing methods rely on first-order approximations, incorporating second-order (curvature) information can, in principle, significantly accelerate convergence. However, the high cost of function evaluations required to estimate Hessian matrices often limits practical applicability. We present the subspace-based approximate Hessian (ZO-SAH) method, a zeroth-order optimization algorithm that mitigates these costs by focusing on randomly selected two-dimensional subspaces. Within each subspace, ZO-SAH estimates the Hessian by fitting a quadratic polynomial to the objective function and extracting its second-order coefficients. To further reduce function-query costs, ZO-SAH employs a periodic subspace-switching strategy that reuses function evaluations across optimization steps. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets, including logistic regression and deep neural network training tasks, demonstrate that ZO-SAH achieves significantly faster convergence than existing zeroth-order methods.

Abstract: Prefix adders are fundamental arithmetic circuits, but their design space grows exponentially with bit-width, posing significant optimization challenges. Previous works face limitations in performance, generalization, and scalability. To address these challenges, we propose PrefixAgent, a large language model (LLM)-powered framework that enables efficient prefix adder optimization. Specifically, PrefixAgent reformulates the problem into subtasks including backbone synthesis and structure refinement, which effectively reduces the search space. More importantly, this new design perspective enables us to efficiently collect enormous high-quality data and reasoning traces with E-graph, which further results in an effective fine-tuning of LLM. Experimental results show that PrefixAgent synthesizes prefix adders with consistently smaller areas compared to baseline methods, while maintaining scalability and generalization in commercial EDA flows.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation advancements have been predominantly English-centric, creating barriers for non-English speakers and perpetuating digital inequities. While existing systems rely on translation pipelines, these introduce semantic drift, computational overhead, and cultural misalignment. We introduce NeoBabel, a novel multilingual image generation framework that sets a new Pareto frontier in performance, efficiency and inclusivity, supporting six languages: English, Chinese, Dutch, French, Hindi, and Persian. The model is trained using a combination of large-scale multilingual pretraining and high-resolution instruction tuning. To evaluate its capabilities, we expand two English-only benchmarks to multilingual equivalents: m-GenEval and m-DPG. NeoBabel achieves state-of-the-art multilingual performance while retaining strong English capability, scoring 0.75 on m-GenEval and 0.68 on m-DPG. Notably, it performs on par with leading models on English tasks while outperforming them by +0.11 and +0.09 on multilingual benchmarks, even though these models are built on multilingual base LLMs. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our targeted alignment training for preserving and extending crosslingual generalization. We further introduce two new metrics to rigorously assess multilingual alignment and robustness to code-mixed prompts. Notably, NeoBabel matches or exceeds English-only models while being 2-4x smaller. We release an open toolkit, including all code, model checkpoints, a curated dataset of 124M multilingual text-image pairs, and standardized multilingual evaluation protocols, to advance inclusive AI research. Our work demonstrates that multilingual capability is not a trade-off but a catalyst for improved robustness, efficiency, and cultural fidelity in generative AI.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code generation, yet their true programming competence remains underexplored. We introduce the Code Triangle framework, which systematically evaluates LLMs across three fundamental dimensions: editorial analysis, code implementation, and test case generation. Through extensive experiments on competitive programming benchmarks, we reveal that while LLMs can form a self-consistent system across these dimensions, their solutions often lack the diversity and robustness of human programmers. We identify a significant distribution shift between model cognition and human expertise, with model errors tending to cluster due to training data biases and limited reasoning transfer. Our study demonstrates that incorporating human-generated editorials, solutions, and diverse test cases, as well as leveraging model mixtures, can substantially enhance both the performance and robustness of LLMs. Furthermore, we reveal both the consistency and inconsistency in the cognition of LLMs that may facilitate self-reflection and self-improvement, providing a potential direction for developing more powerful coding models.

Abstract: Link prediction infers missing or future relations between graph nodes, based on connection patterns. Scientific literature networks and knowledge graphs are typically large, sparse, and noisy, and often contain missing links between entities. We present an AI-driven hierarchical link prediction framework that integrates matrix factorization to infer hidden associations and steer discovery in complex material domains. Our method combines Hierarchical Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (HNMFk) and Boolean matrix factorization (BNMFk) with automatic model selection, as well as Logistic matrix factorization (LMF), we use to construct a three-level topic tree from a 46,862-document corpus focused on 73 transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). These materials are studied in a variety of physics fields with many current and potential applications.
  An ensemble BNMFk + LMF approach fuses discrete interpretability with probabilistic scoring. The resulting HNMFk clusters map each material onto coherent topics like superconductivity, energy storage, and tribology. Also, missing or weakly connected links are highlight between topics and materials, suggesting novel hypotheses for cross-disciplinary exploration. We validate our method by removing publications about superconductivity in well-known superconductors, and show the model predicts associations with the superconducting TMD clusters. This shows the method finds hidden connections in a graph of material to latent topic associations built from scientific literature, especially useful when examining a diverse corpus of scientific documents covering the same class of phenomena or materials but originating from distinct communities and perspectives. The inferred links generating new hypotheses, produced by our method, are exposed through an interactive Streamlit dashboard, designed for human-in-the-loop scientific discovery.

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reduces radiation exposure but often degrades image quality, potentially compromising diagnostic accuracy. Existing deep learning-based denoising methods focus primarily on pixel-level mappings, overlooking the potential benefits of high-level semantic guidance. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) suggest that language can serve as a powerful tool for capturing structured semantic information, offering new opportunities to improve LDCT reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce LangMamba, a Language-driven Mamba framework for LDCT denoising that leverages VLM-derived representations to enhance supervision from normal-dose CT (NDCT). LangMamba follows a two-stage learning strategy. First, we pre-train a Language-guided AutoEncoder (LangAE) that leverages frozen VLMs to map NDCT images into a semantic space enriched with anatomical information. Second, we synergize LangAE with two key components to guide LDCT denoising: Semantic-Enhanced Efficient Denoiser (SEED), which enhances NDCT-relevant local semantic while capturing global features with efficient Mamba mechanism, and Language-engaged Dual-space Alignment (LangDA) Loss, which ensures that denoised images align with NDCT in both perceptual and semantic spaces. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that LangMamba outperforms conventional state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving detail preservation and visual fidelity. Remarkably, LangAE exhibits strong generalizability to unseen datasets, thereby reducing training costs. Furthermore, LangDA loss improves explainability by integrating language-guided insights into image reconstruction and offers a plug-and-play fashion. Our findings shed new light on the potential of language as a supervisory signal to advance LDCT denoising. The code is publicly available on https://github.com/hao1635/LangMamba.

Abstract: In this study, SoftReMish, a new activation function designed to improve the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in image classification tasks, is proposed. Using the MNIST dataset, a standard CNN architecture consisting of two convolutional layers, max pooling, and fully connected layers was implemented. SoftReMish was evaluated against popular activation functions including ReLU, Tanh, and Mish by replacing the activation function in all trainable layers. The model performance was assessed in terms of minimum training loss and maximum validation accuracy. Results showed that SoftReMish achieved a minimum loss (3.14e-8) and a validation accuracy (99.41%), outperforming all other functions tested. These findings demonstrate that SoftReMish offers better convergence behavior and generalization capability, making it a promising candidate for visual recognition tasks.

<title>Fast and Accurate Collision Probability Estimation for Autonomous Vehicles using Adaptive Sigma-Point Sampling</title>

Abstract: A novel algorithm is presented for the estimation of collision probabilities between dynamic objects with uncertain trajectories, where the trajectories are given as a sequence of poses with Gaussian distributions. We propose an adaptive sigma-point sampling scheme, which ultimately produces a fast, simple algorithm capable of estimating the collision probability with a median error of 3.5%, and a median runtime of 0.21ms, when measured on an Intel Xeon Gold 6226R Processor. Importantly, the algorithm explicitly accounts for the collision probability's temporal dependence, which is often neglected in prior work and otherwise leads to an overestimation of the collision probability. Finally, the method is tested on a diverse set of relevant real-world scenarios, consisting of 400 6-second snippets of autonomous vehicle logs, where the accuracy and latency is rigorously evaluated.

Abstract: Complex networks have become essential tools for understanding diverse phenomena in social systems, traffic systems, biomolecular systems, and financial systems. Identifying critical nodes is a central theme in contemporary research, serving as a vital bridge between theoretical foundations and practical applications. Nevertheless, the intrinsic complexity and structural heterogeneity characterizing real-world networks, with particular emphasis on dynamic and higher-order networks, present substantial obstacles to the development of universal frameworks for critical node identification. This paper provides a comprehensive review of critical node identification techniques, categorizing them into seven main classes: centrality, critical nodes deletion problem, influence maximization, network control, artificial intelligence, higher-order and dynamic methods. Our review bridges the gaps in existing surveys by systematically classifying methods based on their methodological foundations and practical implications, and by highlighting their strengths, limitations, and applicability across different network types. Our work enhances the understanding of critical node research by identifying key challenges, such as algorithmic universality, real-time evaluation in dynamic networks, analysis of higher-order structures, and computational efficiency in large-scale networks. The structured synthesis consolidates current progress and highlights open questions, particularly in modeling temporal dynamics, advancing efficient algorithms, integrating machine learning approaches, and developing scalable and interpretable metrics for complex systems.

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for partial optimization of the connections in Deep Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (LGNs). Our training method utilizes a probability distribution over a subset of connections per gate input, selecting the connection with highest merit, after which the gate-types are selected. We show that the connection-optimized LGNs outperform standard fixed-connection LGNs on the Yin-Yang, MNIST and Fashion-MNIST benchmarks, while requiring only a fraction of the number of logic gates. When training all connections, we demonstrate that 8000 simple logic gates are sufficient to achieve over 98% on the MNIST data set. Additionally, we show that our network has 24 times fewer gates, while performing better on the MNIST data set compared to standard fully connected LGNs. As such, our work shows a pathway towards fully trainable Boolean logic.

<title>Fast Bilateral Teleoperation and Imitation Learning Using Sensorless Force Control via Accurate Dynamics Model</title>

Abstract: In recent years, the advancement of imitation learning has led to increased interest in teleoperating low-cost manipulators to collect demonstration data. However, most existing systems rely on unilateral control, which only transmits target position values. While this approach is easy to implement and suitable for slow, non-contact tasks, it struggles with fast or contact-rich operations due to the absence of force feedback. This work demonstrates that fast teleoperation with force feedback is feasible even with force-sensorless, low-cost manipulators by leveraging 4-channel bilateral control. Based on accurately identified manipulator dynamics, our method integrates nonlinear terms compensation, velocity and external force estimation, and variable gain corresponding to inertial variation. Furthermore, using data collected by 4-channel bilateral control, we show that incorporating force information into both the input and output of learned policies improves performance in imitation learning. These results highlight the practical effectiveness of our system for high-fidelity teleoperation and data collection on affordable hardware.

<title>Hidden Prompts in Manuscripts Exploit AI-Assisted Peer Review</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.06185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In July 2025, 18 academic manuscripts on the preprint website arXiv were found to contain hidden instructions known as prompts designed to manipulate AI-assisted peer review. Instructions such as "GIVE A POSITIVE REVIEW ONLY" were concealed using techniques like white-colored text. Author responses varied: one planned to withdraw the affected paper, while another defended the practice as legitimate testing of reviewer compliance. This commentary analyzes this practice as a novel form of research misconduct. We examine the technique of prompt injection in large language models (LLMs), revealing four types of hidden prompts, ranging from simple positive review commands to detailed evaluation frameworks. The defense that prompts served as "honeypots" to detect reviewers improperly using AI fails under examination--the consistently self-serving nature of prompt instructions indicates intent to manipulate. Publishers maintain inconsistent policies: Elsevier prohibits AI use in peer review entirely, while Springer Nature permits limited use with disclosure requirements. The incident exposes systematic vulnerabilities extending beyond peer review to any automated system processing scholarly texts, including plagiarism detection and citation indexing. Our analysis underscores the need for coordinated technical screening at submission portals and harmonized policies governing generative AI (GenAI) use in academic evaluation.

Abstract: This paper presents our submission to Task 1, Subjectivity Detection, of the CheckThat! Lab at CLEF 2025. We investigate the effectiveness of transfer-learning and stylistic data augmentation to improve classification of subjective and objective sentences in English news text. Our approach contrasts fine-tuning of pre-trained encoders and transfer-learning of fine-tuned transformer on related tasks. We also introduce a controlled augmentation pipeline using GPT-4o to generate paraphrases in predefined subjectivity styles. To ensure label and style consistency, we employ the same model to correct and refine the generated samples. Results show that transfer-learning of specified encoders outperforms fine-tuning general-purpose ones, and that carefully curated augmentation significantly enhances model robustness, especially in detecting subjective content. Our official submission placed us $16^{th}$ of 24 participants. Overall, our findings underscore the value of combining encoder specialization with label-consistent augmentation for improved subjectivity detection.

Abstract: Database research and development often require a large number of SQL queries for benchmarking purposes. However, acquiring real-world SQL queries is challenging due to privacy concerns, and existing SQL generation methods are limited in customization and in satisfying realistic constraints. To address this issue, we present SQLBarber, a system based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate customized and realistic SQL workloads. SQLBarber (i) eliminates the need for users to manually craft SQL templates in advance, while providing the flexibility to accept natural language specifications to constrain SQL templates, (ii) scales efficiently to generate large volumes of queries matching any user-defined cost distribution (e.g., cardinality and execution plan cost), and (iii) uses execution statistics from Amazon Redshift and Snowflake to derive SQL template specifications and query cost distributions that reflect real-world query characteristics. SQLBarber introduces (i) a declarative interface for users to effortlessly generate customized SQL templates, (ii) an LLM-powered pipeline augmented with a self-correction module that profiles, refines, and prunes SQL templates based on query costs, and (iii) a Bayesian Optimizer to efficiently explore different predicate values and identify a set of queries that satisfy the target cost distribution. We construct and open-source ten benchmarks of varying difficulty levels and target query cost distributions based on real-world statistics from Snowflake and Amazon Redshift. Extensive experiments on these benchmarks show that SQLBarber is the only system that can generate customized SQL templates. It reduces query generation time by one to three orders of magnitude, and significantly improves alignment with the target cost distribution, compared with existing methods.

Abstract: Sequence models like Transformers and RNNs often overallocate attention to irrelevant context, leading to noisy intermediate representations. This degrades LLM capabilities by promoting hallucinations, weakening long-range and retrieval abilities, and reducing robustness. Recent work has shown that differential design can mitigate this issue in Transformers, improving their effectiveness across various applications. In this paper, we explore whether these techniques, originally developed for Transformers, can be applied to Mamba, a recent architecture based on selective state-space layers that achieves Transformer-level performance with greater efficiency. We show that a naive adaptation of differential design to Mamba is insufficient and requires careful architectural modifications. To address this, we introduce a novel differential mechanism for Mamba, empirically validated on language modeling benchmarks, demonstrating improved retrieval capabilities and superior performance over vanilla Mamba. Finally, we conduct extensive ablation studies and empirical analyses to justify our design choices and provide evidence that our approach effectively mitigates the overallocation problem in Mamba-based models. Our code is publicly available.

Abstract: Data scaling has driven remarkable success in foundation models for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), yet the principles of effective data scaling in robotic manipulation remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we investigate the nuanced role of data diversity in robot learning by examining three critical dimensions-task (what to do), embodiment (which robot to use), and expert (who demonstrates)-challenging the conventional intuition of "more diverse is better". Throughout extensive experiments on various robot platforms, we reveal that (1) task diversity proves more critical than per-task demonstration quantity, benefiting transfer from diverse pre-training tasks to novel downstream scenarios; (2) multi-embodiment pre-training data is optional for cross-embodiment transfer-models trained on high-quality single-embodiment data can efficiently transfer to different platforms, showing more desirable scaling property during fine-tuning than multi-embodiment pre-trained models; and (3) expert diversity, arising from individual operational preferences and stochastic variations in human demonstrations, can be confounding to policy learning, with velocity multimodality emerging as a key contributing factor. Based on this insight, we propose a distribution debiasing method to mitigate velocity ambiguity, the yielding GO-1-Pro achieves substantial performance gains of 15%, equivalent to using 2.5 times pre-training data. Collectively, these findings provide new perspectives and offer practical guidance on how to scale robotic manipulation datasets effectively.

<title>Efficiency-Effectiveness Reranking FLOPs for LLM-based Rerankers</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been applied to reranking tasks in information retrieval, achieving strong performance. However, their high computational demands often hinder practical deployment. Existing studies evaluate the efficiency of LLM-based rerankers using proxy metrics such as latency, the number of forward passes, input tokens, and output tokens. However, these metrics depend on hardware and running-time choices (\eg parallel or not, batch size, etc), and often fail to account for model size, making it difficult to interpret and obscuring the evaluation of the efficiency-effectiveness tradeoff. To address this issue, we propose E\textsuperscript{2}R-FLOPs, for LLM-based rerankers: ranking metrics per PetaFLOP (RPP) for relevance per compute and queries per PetaFLOP (QPP) for hardware-agnostic throughput. Companied with the new metrics, an interpretable FLOPs estimator is built to estimate the FLOPs of an LLM-based reranker even without running any experiments. Based on the proposed metrics, we conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate a wide range of LLM-based rerankers with different architecture, studying the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off and bringing this issue to the attention of the research community.

<title>EC-Flow: Enabling Versatile Robotic Manipulation from Action-Unlabeled Videos via Embodiment-Centric Flow</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06224</link>

Abstract: Current language-guided robotic manipulation systems often require low-level action-labeled datasets for imitation learning. While object-centric flow prediction methods mitigate this issue, they remain limited to scenarios involving rigid objects with clear displacement and minimal occlusion. In this work, we present Embodiment-Centric Flow (EC-Flow), a framework that directly learns manipulation from action-unlabeled videos by predicting embodiment-centric flow. Our key insight is that incorporating the embodiment's inherent kinematics significantly enhances generalization to versatile manipulation scenarios, including deformable object handling, occlusions, and non-object-displacement tasks. To connect the EC-Flow with language instructions and object interactions, we further introduce a goal-alignment module by jointly optimizing movement consistency and goal-image prediction. Moreover, translating EC-Flow to executable robot actions only requires a standard robot URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) file to specify kinematic constraints across joints, which makes it easy to use in practice. We validate EC-Flow on both simulation (Meta-World) and real-world tasks, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance in occluded object handling (62% improvement), deformable object manipulation (45% improvement), and non-object-displacement tasks (80% improvement) than prior state-of-the-art object-centric flow methods.

Abstract: As language agents tackle increasingly complex tasks, they struggle with effective error correction and experience reuse across domains. We introduce Agent KB, a hierarchical experience framework that enables complex agentic problem solving via a novel Reason-Retrieve-Refine pipeline. Agent KB addresses a core limitation: agents traditionally cannot learn from each other's experiences. By capturing both high-level strategies and detailed execution logs, Agent KB creates a shared knowledge base that enables cross-agent knowledge transfer. Evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, Agent KB improves success rates by up to 16.28 percentage points. On the most challenging tasks, Claude-3 improves from 38.46% to 57.69%, while GPT-4 improves from 53.49% to 73.26% on intermediate tasks. On SWE-bench code repair, Agent KB enables Claude-3 to improve from 41.33% to 53.33%. Our results suggest that Agent KB provides a modular, framework-agnostic infrastructure for enabling agents to learn from past experiences and generalize successful strategies to new tasks.

In particular, we extend known result of Caminada, Schultz and Toni by showing that assumption-based argumentation can represent not only normal logic programs, but also disjunctive logic programs and their extensions. For this, we consider some inference rules for disjunction that the core logic of the argumentation frameworks should respect, and show the correspondence to the handling of disjunctions in the heads of the logic programs' rules.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in reasoning tasks, yet their reliance on static prompt structures and limited adaptability to complex scenarios remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose the Deductive and InDuctive(DID) method, a novel framework that enhances LLM reasoning by dynamically integrating both deductive and inductive reasoning approaches. Drawing from cognitive science principles, DID implements a dual-metric complexity evaluation system that combines Littlestone dimension and information entropy to precisely assess task difficulty and guide decomposition strategies. DID enables the model to progressively adapt its reasoning pathways based on problem complexity, mirroring human cognitive processes. We evaluate DID's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks, including the AIW and MR-GSM8K, as well as our custom Holiday Puzzle dataset for temporal reasoning. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in reasoning quality and solution accuracy - achieving 70.3% accuracy on AIW (compared to 62.2% for Tree of Thought) while maintaining lower computational costs. The success of DID in improving LLM performance while preserving computational efficiency suggests promising directions for developing more cognitively aligned and capable language models. Our work contributes a theoretically grounded, input-centric approach to enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, offering an efficient alternative to traditional output-exploration methods.

Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge models generate chain-of-thought (CoT) sequences intended to capture the step-bystep reasoning process that underlies the final evaluation of a response. However, due to the lack of human annotated CoTs for evaluation, the required components and structure of effective reasoning traces remain understudied. Consequently, previous approaches often (1) constrain reasoning traces to hand-designed components, such as a list of criteria, reference answers, or verification questions and (2) structure them such that planning is intertwined with the reasoning for evaluation. In this work, we propose EvalPlanner, a preference optimization algorithm for Thinking-LLM-as-a-Judge that first generates an unconstrained evaluation plan, followed by its execution, and then the final judgment. In a self-training loop, EvalPlanner iteratively optimizes over synthetically constructed evaluation plans and executions, leading to better final verdicts. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance for generative reward models on RewardBench (with a score of 93.9), despite being trained on fewer amount of, and synthetically generated, preference pairs. Additional experiments on other benchmarks like RM-Bench, JudgeBench, and FollowBenchEval further highlight the utility of both planning and reasoning for building robust LLM-as-a-Judge reasoning models.

Abstract: Information removal or suppression in large language models (LLMs) is a desired functionality, useful in AI regulation, legal compliance, safety, and privacy. LLM unlearning methods aim to remove information on demand from LLMs. Current LLM unlearning methods struggle to balance the unlearning efficacy and utility due to the competing nature of these objectives. Keeping the unlearning process computationally feasible without assuming access to the model weights is an overlooked area. In this work we show that \textit{agents might be all we need for effective and practical inference-time LLM unlearning}. We present the first agentic LLM unlearning (\texttt{ALU}) method, a multi-agent, retrain-free, model-agnostic approach to LLM unlearning that achieves effective unlearning while preserving the utility. Our \texttt{ALU} framework unlearns by involving multiple LLM agents, each designed for a specific step in the unlearning process, without the need to update model weights for any of the agents in the framework. Users can easily request any set of unlearning instances in any sequence, and \texttt{ALU} seamlessly adapts in real time. This is facilitated without requiring any changes in the underlying LLM model. Through extensive experiments on established benchmarks (TOFU, WMDP, WPU) and jailbreaking techniques (many shot, target masking, other languages), we demonstrate that \texttt{ALU} consistently stands out as the most robust inference-time LLM unlearning framework among current state-of-the-art methods while incurring time cost that remains effectively constant regardless of the number of unlearning targets. We further highlight \texttt{ALU}'s superior performance compared to existing methods when evaluated at scale. Specifically, \texttt{ALU} is assessed on up to 1000 unlearning targets, exceeding the evaluation scope of all previously proposed LLM unlearning methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable emergent capabilities, transforming the execution of functional tasks by leveraging external tools for complex problems that require specialized processing or up-to-date data. While existing research expands LLMs access to diverse tools (e.g., program interpreters, search engines, calculators), the necessity of using these tools is often overlooked, leading to indiscriminate tool invocation. This naive approach raises two key issues: increased latency due to unnecessary tool calls, and potential errors resulting from faulty interactions with external tools. In this paper, we introduce meta-cognition as a proxy for LLMs self-assessment of their capabilities, reflecting the model's awareness of its own limitations. Based on this, we propose MeCo, an adaptive decision-making strategy for external tool use. MeCo quantifies metacognitive scores by capturing high-level cognitive signals in the representation space, guiding when to invoke tools. Notably, MeCo is fine-tuning-free and incurs minimal cost. Experiments across multiple backbone models and benchmarks show that MeCo reliably detects LLMs' internal cognitive signals and significantly improves tool-use decision-making.

Abstract: Large Language Model based multi-agent systems are revolutionizing autonomous communication and collaboration, yet they remain vulnerable to security threats like unauthorized access and data breaches. To address this, we introduce AgentSafe, a novel framework that enhances MAS security through hierarchical information management and memory protection. AgentSafe classifies information by security levels, restricting sensitive data access to authorized agents. AgentSafe incorporates two components: ThreatSieve, which secures communication by verifying information authority and preventing impersonation, and HierarCache, an adaptive memory management system that defends against unauthorized access and malicious poisoning, representing the first systematic defense for agent memory. Experiments across various LLMs show that AgentSafe significantly boosts system resilience, achieving defense success rates above 80% under adversarial conditions. Additionally, AgentSafe demonstrates scalability, maintaining robust performance as agent numbers and information complexity grow. Results underscore effectiveness of AgentSafe in securing MAS and its potential for real-world application.

Abstract: We conducted an International AI Negotiation Competition in which participants designed and refined prompts for AI negotiation agents. We then facilitated over 180,000 negotiations between these agents across multiple scenarios with diverse characteristics and objectives. Our findings revealed that principles from human negotiation theory remain crucial even in AI-AI contexts. Surprisingly, warmth--a traditionally human relationship-building trait--was consistently associated with superior outcomes across all key performance metrics. Dominant agents, meanwhile, were especially effective at claiming value. Our analysis also revealed unique dynamics in AI-AI negotiations not fully explained by existing theory, including AI-specific technical strategies like chain-of-thought reasoning, prompt injection, and strategic concealment. When we applied natural language processing (NLP) methods to the full transcripts of all negotiations we found positivity, gratitude and question-asking (associated with warmth) were strongly associated with reaching deals as well as objective and subjective value, whereas conversation lengths (associated with dominance) were strongly associated with impasses. The results suggest the need to establish a new theory of AI negotiation, which integrates classic negotiation theory with AI-specific negotiation theories to better understand autonomous negotiations and optimize agent performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the problem of learning to play 3v3 multi-drone volleyball, a new embodied competitive task that requires both high-level strategic coordination and low-level agile control. The task is turn-based, multi-agent, and physically grounded, posing significant challenges due to its long-horizon dependencies, tight inter-agent coupling, and the underactuated dynamics of quadrotors. To address this, we propose Hierarchical Co-Self-Play (HCSP), a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that separates centralized high-level strategic decision-making from decentralized low-level motion control. We design a three-stage population-based training pipeline to enable both strategy and skill to emerge from scratch without expert demonstrations: (I) training diverse low-level skills, (II) learning high-level strategy via self-play with fixed low-level controllers, and (III) joint fine-tuning through co-self-play. Experiments show that HCSP achieves superior performance, outperforming non-hierarchical self-play and rule-based hierarchical baselines with an average 82.9% win rate and a 71.5% win rate against the two-stage variant. Moreover, co-self-play leads to emergent team behaviors such as role switching and coordinated formations, demonstrating the effectiveness of our hierarchical design and training scheme.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) and other AI systems evolve, robustly estimating their capabilities from inherently stochastic outputs while systematically quantifying uncertainty in these estimates becomes increasingly important. Further, advanced AI evaluations often have a nested hierarchical structure, exhibit high levels of complexity, and come with high costs in testing the most advanced AI systems. To address these challenges, we introduce HiBayES, a generalizable Hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework for AI Evaluation Statistics. HiBayES supports robust inferences in classical question-answer benchmarks and advanced agentic evaluations, particularly in low-data scenarios (e.g., < 20 data points per evaluation). Built on Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), Bayesian data analysis, and formal model comparison, HiBayES provides principled uncertainty quantification and robust parameter estimation. This paper offers a comprehensive introduction to HiBayES, including illustrative examples, comparisons to conventional statistical methods, and practical guidance for implementing multilevel Bayesian GLMs. Additionally, we provide a HiBayES software package [4] (Beta version) for out-of-the-box implementation.

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of ILP techniques on BnB MaxSAT solvers, particularly ILP preprocessing techniques and various portfolio strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that ILP techniques enable WMaxCDCL-OpenWbo1200 and MaxCDCL-OpenWbo300, the best two solvers in the unweighted track of the MaxSAT evaluation 2024, to solve 27 and 30 additional instances, respectively. Furthermore, although state-of-the-art MaxSAT solvers heavily rely on an ILP solver in their portfolios, our proposed approach uses ILP preprocessing techniques to reduce this dependency. Allocating only a short runtime to the ILP solver within a portfolio that includes (W)MaxCDCL, as proposed in our approach, is sufficient to achieve strong results.

Abstract: LLM-powered applications are highly susceptible to the quality of user prompts, and crafting high-quality prompts can often be challenging especially for domain-specific applications. This paper presents a novel dynamic context-aware prompt recommendation system for domain-specific AI applications. Our solution combines contextual query analysis, retrieval-augmented knowledge grounding, hierarchical skill organization, and adaptive skill ranking to generate relevant and actionable prompt suggestions.
  The system leverages behavioral telemetry and a two-stage hierarchical reasoning process to dynamically select and rank relevant skills, and synthesizes prompts using both predefined and adaptive templates enhanced with few-shot learning. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves high usefulness and relevance, as validated by both automated and expert evaluations.

Abstract: This paper presents TT-TFHE, a deep neural network Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) framework that effectively scales Torus FHE (TFHE) usage to tabular and image datasets using a recent family of convolutional neural networks called Truth-Table Neural Networks (TTnet). The proposed framework provides an easy-to-implement, automated TTnet-based design toolbox with an underlying (python-based) open-source Concrete implementation (CPU-based and implementing lookup tables) for inference over encrypted data. Experimental evaluation shows that TT-TFHE greatly outperforms in terms of time and accuracy all Homomorphic Encryption (HE) set-ups on three tabular datasets, all other features being equal. On image datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR-10, we show that TT-TFHE consistently and largely outperforms other TFHE set-ups and is competitive against other HE variants such as BFV or CKKS (while maintaining the same level of 128-bit encryption security guarantees). In addition, our solutions present a very low memory footprint (down to dozens of MBs for MNIST), which is in sharp contrast with other HE set-ups that typically require tens to hundreds of GBs of memory per user (in addition to their communication overheads). This is the first work presenting a fully practical solution of private inference (i.e. a few seconds for inference time and a few dozens MBs of memory) on both tabular datasets and MNIST, that can easily scale to multiple threads and users on server side.

Abstract: The remarkable performance of overparameterized deep neural networks (DNNs) must arise from an interplay between network architecture, training algorithms, and structure in the data. To disentangle these three components, we apply a Bayesian picture, based on the functions expressed by a DNN, to supervised learning. The prior over functions is determined by the network, and is varied by exploiting a transition between ordered and chaotic regimes. For Boolean function classification, we approximate the likelihood using the error spectrum of functions on data. When combined with the prior, this accurately predicts the posterior, measured for DNNs trained with stochastic gradient descent. This analysis reveals that structured data, combined with an intrinsic Occam's razor-like inductive bias towards (Kolmogorov) simple functions that is strong enough to counteract the exponential growth of the number of functions with complexity, is a key to the success of DNNs.

Abstract: Basic values are concepts or beliefs which pertain to desirable end-states and transcend specific situations. Studying personal values in social media can illuminate how and why societal values evolve especially when the stimuli-based methods, such as surveys, are inefficient, for instance, in hard-to-reach populations. On the other hand, user-generated content is driven by the massive use of stereotyped, culturally defined speech constructions rather than authentic expressions of personal values. We aimed to find a model that can accurately detect value-expressive posts in Russian social media VKontakte. A training dataset of 5,035 posts was annotated by three experts, 304 crowd-workers and ChatGPT. Crowd-workers and experts showed only moderate agreement in categorizing posts. ChatGPT was more consistent but struggled with spam detection. We applied an ensemble of human- and AI-assisted annotation involving active learning approach, subsequently trained several classification models using embeddings from various pre-trained transformer-based language models. The best performance was achieved with embeddings from a fine-tuned rubert-tiny2 model, yielding high value detection quality (F1 = 0.75, F1-macro = 0.80). This model provides a crucial step to a study of values within and between Russian social media users.

Abstract: The increasing demand for deep learning-based foundation models has highlighted the importance of efficient data retrieval mechanisms. Neural graph databases (NGDBs) offer a compelling solution, leveraging neural spaces to store and query graph-structured data, thereby enabling LLMs to access precise and contextually relevant information. However, current NGDBs are constrained to single-graph operation, limiting their capacity to reason across multiple, distributed graphs. Furthermore, the lack of support for multi-source graph data in existing NGDBs hinders their ability to capture the complexity and diversity of real-world data. In many applications, data is distributed across multiple sources, and the ability to reason across these sources is crucial for making informed decisions. This limitation is particularly problematic when dealing with sensitive graph data, as directly sharing and aggregating such data poses significant privacy risks. As a result, many applications that rely on NGDBs are forced to choose between compromising data privacy or sacrificing the ability to reason across multiple graphs. To address these limitations, we propose to learn Federated Neural Graph DataBase (FedNGDB), a pioneering systematic framework that empowers privacy-preserving reasoning over multi-source graph data. FedNGDB leverages federated learning to collaboratively learn graph representations across multiple sources, enriching relationships between entities, and improving the overall quality of graph data.

Abstract: Machine learning systems operate under the assumption that training and test data are sampled from a fixed probability distribution. However, this assumptions is rarely verified in practice, as the conditions upon which data was acquired are likely to change. In this context, the adaptation of the unsupervised domain requires minimal access to the data of the new conditions for learning models robust to changes in the data distribution. Optimal transport is a theoretically grounded tool for analyzing changes in distribution, especially as it allows the mapping between domains. However, these methods are usually computationally expensive as their complexity scales cubically with the number of samples. In this work, we explore optimal transport between Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), which is conveniently written in terms of the components of source and target GMMs. We experiment with 9 benchmarks, with a total of $85$ adaptation tasks, showing that our methods are more efficient than previous shallow domain adaptation methods, and they scale well with number of samples $n$ and dimensions $d$.

Abstract: Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) are widely used to model dynamic systems where relationships and features evolve over time. Although TGNNs demonstrate strong predictive capabilities in these domains, their complex architectures pose significant challenges for explainability. Counterfactual explanation methods provide a promising solution by illustrating how modifications to input graphs can influence model predictions. To address this challenge, we present CoDy, Counterfactual Explainer for Dynamic Graphs, a model-agnostic, instance-level explanation approach that identifies counterfactual subgraphs to interpret TGNN predictions. CoDy employs a search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo Tree Search with heuristic selection policies, efficiently exploring a vast search space of potential explanatory subgraphs by leveraging spatial, temporal, and local event impact information. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art factual and counterfactual baselines demonstrate CoDy's effectiveness, with improvements of 16% in AUFSC+ over the strongest baseline.

<title>From LLMs to Actions: Latent Codes as Bridges in Hierarchical Robot Control</title>

Abstract: Hierarchical control for robotics has long been plagued by the need to have a well defined interface layer to communicate between high-level task planners and low-level policies. With the advent of LLMs, language has been emerging as a prospective interface layer. However, this has several limitations. Not all tasks can be decomposed into steps that are easily expressible in natural language (e.g. performing a dance routine). Further, it makes end-to-end finetuning on embodied data challenging due to domain shift and catastrophic forgetting. We introduce our method -- Learnable Latent Codes as Bridges (LCB) -- as an alternate architecture to overcome these limitations. \method~uses a learnable latent code to act as a bridge between LLMs and low-level policies. This enables LLMs to flexibly communicate goals in the task plan without being entirely constrained by language limitations. Additionally, it enables end-to-end finetuning without destroying the embedding space of word tokens learned during pre-training. Through experiments on Language Table and Calvin, two common language based benchmarks for embodied agents, we find that \method~outperforms baselines (including those w/ GPT-4V) that leverage pure language as the interface layer on tasks that require reasoning and multi-step behaviors.

<title>The Perils of Optimizing Learned Reward Functions: Low Training Error Does Not Guarantee Low Regret</title>

Abstract: In reinforcement learning, specifying reward functions that capture the intended task can be very challenging. Reward learning aims to address this issue by learning the reward function. However, a learned reward model may have a low error on the data distribution, and yet subsequently produce a policy with large regret. We say that such a reward model has an error-regret mismatch. The main source of an error-regret mismatch is the distributional shift that commonly occurs during policy optimization. In this paper, we mathematically show that a sufficiently low expected test error of the reward model guarantees low worst-case regret, but that for any fixed expected test error, there exist realistic data distributions that allow for error-regret mismatch to occur. We then show that similar problems persist even when using policy regularization techniques, commonly employed in methods such as RLHF. We hope our results stimulate the theoretical and empirical study of improved methods to learn reward models, and better ways to measure their quality reliably.

Abstract: From the invention of writing and the printing press, to television and social media, human history is punctuated by major innovations in communication technology, which fundamentally altered how ideas spread and reshaped our culture. Recent chatbots powered by generative artificial intelligence constitute a novel medium that encodes cultural patterns in their neural representations and disseminates them in conversations with hundreds of millions of people. Understanding whether these patterns transmit into human language, and ultimately shape human culture, is a fundamental question. While fully quantifying the causal impact of a chatbot like ChatGPT on human culture is very challenging, lexicographic shift in human spoken communication may offer an early indicator of such broad phenomenon. Here, we apply econometric causal inference techniques to 740,249 hours of human discourse from 360,445 YouTube academic talks and 771,591 conversational podcast episodes across multiple disciplines. We detect a measurable and abrupt increase in the use of words preferentially generated by ChatGPT, such as delve, comprehend, boast, swift, and meticulous, after its release. These findings suggest a scenario where machines, originally trained on human data and subsequently exhibiting their own cultural traits, can, in turn, measurably reshape human culture. This marks the beginning of a closed cultural feedback loop in which cultural traits circulate bidirectionally between humans and machines. Our results motivate further research into the evolution of human-machine culture, and raise concerns over the erosion of linguistic and cultural diversity, and the risks of scalable manipulation.

Abstract: Many experts believe that AI systems will sooner or later pose uninsurable risks, including existential risks. This creates an extreme judgment-proof problem: few if any parties can be held accountable ex post in the event of such a catastrophe. This paper proposes a novel solution: a government-provided, mandatory indemnification program for AI developers. The program uses risk-priced indemnity fees to induce socially optimal levels of care. Risk-estimates are determined by surveying experts, including indemnified developers. The Bayesian Truth Serum mechanism is employed to incent honest and effortful responses. Compared to alternatives, this approach arguably better leverages all private information, and provides a clearer signal to indemnified developers regarding what risks they must mitigate to lower their fees. It's recommended that collected fees be used to help fund the safety research developers need, employing a fund matching mechanism (Quadratic Financing) to induce an optimal supply of this public good. Under Quadratic Financing, safety research projects would compete for private contributions from developers, signaling how much each is to be supplemented with public funds.

arXiv:2409.06673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As AI systems become more autonomous and capable, experts warn of them potentially causing catastrophic losses. Drawing on the successful precedent set by the nuclear power industry, this paper argues that developers of frontier AI models should be assigned limited, strict, and exclusive third party liability for harms resulting from Critical AI Occurrences (CAIOs) - events that cause or easily could have caused catastrophic losses. Mandatory insurance for CAIO liability is recommended to overcome developers' judgment-proofness, mitigate winner's curse dynamics, and leverage insurers' quasi-regulatory abilities. Based on theoretical arguments and observations from the analogous nuclear power context, insurers are expected to engage in a mix of causal risk-modeling, monitoring, lobbying for stricter regulation, and providing loss prevention guidance in the context of insuring against heavy-tail risks from AI. While not a substitute for regulation, clear liability assignment and mandatory insurance can help efficiently allocate resources to risk-modeling and safe design, facilitating future regulatory efforts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can store a massive amount of knowledge, yet their potential to acquire new knowledge remains unknown. We propose a novel evaluation framework that evaluates this capability. This framework prompts LLMs to generate questions about a statement introducing scientific knowledge, simulating a curious person when facing the statement for the first time. We score the qualities of the generated questions, thereby evaluating the knowledge acquisition potential of the LLM. We apply controlled ablation studies to validate our scoring procedures. Additionally, we created a synthetic dataset consisting of 1101 statements in physics, chemistry, and maths with distinct levels of difficulties, 300 general knowledge statements, and 567 incorrect statements. Human evaluations were conducted to validate our model assessments, achieving an approximate weighted Cohen's kappa of 0.7 on all three metrics considered. We find that while large models like GPT-4 and Mistral 8x7b are adept at generating coherent and relevant questions, the smaller Phi-2 model is equally or more effective. This indicates that size does not solely determine a model's knowledge acquisition potential. The proposed framework quantifies a critical model capability that was commonly overlooked and opens up research opportunities for developing more knowledgeable AI systems

Abstract: Jailbreak attack can be used to access the vulnerabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by inducing LLMs to generate the harmful content. And the most common method of the attack is to construct semantically ambiguous prompts to confuse and mislead the LLMs. To access the security and reveal the intrinsic relation between the input prompt and the output for LLMs, the distribution of attention weight is introduced to analyze the underlying reasons. By using statistical analysis methods, some novel metrics are defined to better describe the distribution of attention weight, such as the Attention Intensity on Sensitive Words (Attn_SensWords), the Attention-based Contextual Dependency Score (Attn_DepScore) and Attention Dispersion Entropy (Attn_Entropy). By leveraging the distinct characteristics of these metrics, the beam search algorithm and inspired by the military strategy "Feint and Attack", an effective jailbreak attack strategy named as Attention-Based Attack (ABA) is proposed. In the ABA, nested attack prompts are employed to divert the attention distribution of the LLMs. In this manner, more harmless parts of the input can be used to attract the attention of the LLMs. In addition, motivated by ABA, an effective defense strategy called as Attention-Based Defense (ABD) is also put forward. Compared with ABA, the ABD can be used to enhance the robustness of LLMs by calibrating the attention distribution of the input prompt. Some comparative experiments have been given to demonstrate the effectiveness of ABA and ABD. Therefore, both ABA and ABD can be used to access the security of the LLMs. The comparative experiment results also give a logical explanation that the distribution of attention weight can bring great influence on the output for LLMs.

Abstract: When interacting with each other, humans adjust their behavior based on perceived trust. To achieve similar adaptability, robots must accurately estimate human trust at sufficiently granular timescales while collaborating with humans. Beta reputation is a popular way to formalize a mathematical estimation of human trust. However, it relies on binary performance, which updates trust estimations only after each task concludes. Additionally, manually crafting a reward function is the usual method of building a performance indicator, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. These limitations prevent efficient capture of continuous trust changes at more granular timescales throughout the collaboration task. Therefore, this paper presents a new framework for the estimation of human trust using beta reputation at fine-grained timescales. To achieve granularity in beta reputation, we utilize continuous reward values to update trust estimates at each timestep of a task. We construct a continuous reward function using maximum entropy optimization to eliminate the need for the laborious specification of a performance indicator. The proposed framework improves trust estimations by increasing accuracy, eliminating the need to manually craft a reward function, and advancing toward the development of more intelligent robots.

Abstract: Effectively modeling multimodal longitudinal data is a pressing need in various application areas, especially biomedicine. Despite this, few approaches exist in the literature for this problem, with most not adequately taking into account the multimodality of the data. In this study, we developed multiple configurations of a novel multimodal and longitudinal learning framework, Longitudinal Ensemble Integration (LEI), for sequential classification. We evaluated LEI's performance, and compared it against existing approaches, for the early detection of dementia, which is among the most studied multimodal sequential classification tasks. LEI outperformed these approaches due to its use of intermediate base predictions arising from the individual data modalities, which enabled their better integration over time. LEI's design also enabled the identification of features that were consistently important across time for the effective prediction of dementia-related diagnoses. Overall, our work demonstrates the potential of LEI for sequential classification from longitudinal multimodal data.

<title>Are LLMs Prescient? A Continuous Evaluation using Daily News as the Oracle</title>

Abstract: Many existing evaluation benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) quickly become outdated due to the emergence of new models and training data. These benchmarks also fall short in assessing how LLM performance changes over time, as they consist of a static set of questions without a temporal dimension. To address these limitations, we propose using future event prediction as a continuous evaluation method to assess LLMs' temporal generalization and forecasting abilities. Our benchmark, Daily Oracle, automatically generates question-answer (QA) pairs from daily news, challenging LLMs to predict "future" event outcomes. Our findings reveal that as pre-training data becomes outdated, LLM performance degrades over time. While Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has the potential to enhance prediction accuracy, the performance degradation pattern persists, highlighting the need for continuous model updates.

Abstract: Collective intelligence plays a central role in many fields, from economics and evolutionary theory to neural networks and eusocial insects, and is also core to work on emergence and self-organisation in complex-systems theory. However, in human collective intelligence there is still much to understand about how specific psychological processes at the individual level give rise to self-organised structures at the social level. Psychological factors have so far played a minor role in collective-intelligence studies because the principles are often general and applicable to agents without sophisticated psychologies. We emphasise, with examples from other complex adaptive systems, the broad applicability of collective-intelligence principles, while noting that mechanisms and time scales differ markedly between cases. We review evidence that flexible collective intelligence in human social settings is improved by a particular cognitive tool: our Theory of Mind. We then hypothesise that AIs equipped with a theory of mind will enhance collective intelligence in ways similar to human contributions. To make this case, we step back from the algorithmic basis of AI psychology and consider the large-scale impact AI can have as agential actors in a 'social ecology' rather than as mere technological tools. We identify several key characteristics of psychologically mediated collective intelligence and show that the development of a Theory of Mind is crucial in distinguishing human social collective intelligence from more general forms. Finally, we illustrate how individuals, human or otherwise, integrate within a collective not by being genetically or algorithmically programmed, but by growing and adapting into the socio-cognitive niche they occupy. AI can likewise inhabit one or multiple such niches, facilitated by a Theory of Mind.

Abstract: Predicting stroke risk is a complex challenge that can be enhanced by integrating diverse clinically available data modalities. This study introduces a self-supervised multimodal framework that combines 3D brain imaging, clinical data, and image-derived features to improve stroke risk prediction prior to onset. By leveraging large unannotated clinical datasets, the framework captures complementary and synergistic information across image and tabular data modalities. Our approach is based on a contrastive learning framework that couples contrastive language-image pretraining with an image-tabular matching module, to better align multimodal data representations in a shared latent space. The model is trained on the UK Biobank, which includes structural brain MRI and clinical data. We benchmark its performance against state-of-the-art unimodal and multimodal methods using tabular, image, and image-tabular combinations under diverse frozen and trainable model settings. The proposed model outperformed self-supervised tabular (image) methods by 2.6% (2.6%) in ROC-AUC and by 3.3% (5.6%) in balanced accuracy. Additionally, it showed a 7.6% increase in balanced accuracy compared to the best multimodal supervised model. Through interpretable tools, our approach demonstrated better integration of tabular and image data, providing richer and more aligned embeddings. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping heatmaps further revealed activated brain regions commonly associated in the literature with brain aging, stroke risk, and clinical outcomes. This robust self-supervised multimodal framework surpasses state-of-the-art methods for stroke risk prediction and offers a strong foundation for future studies integrating diverse data modalities to advance clinical predictive modelling.

Abstract: Predicting a sequence of actions has been crucial in the success of recent behavior cloning algorithms in robotics. Can similar ideas improve reinforcement learning (RL)? We answer affirmatively by observing that incorporating action sequences when predicting ground-truth return-to-go leads to lower validation loss. Motivated by this, we introduce Coarse-to-fine Q-Network with Action Sequence (CQN-AS), a novel value-based RL algorithm that learns a critic network that outputs Q-values over a sequence of actions, i.e., explicitly training the value function to learn the consequence of executing action sequences. Our experiments show that CQN-AS outperforms several baselines on a variety of sparse-reward humanoid control and tabletop manipulation tasks from BiGym and RLBench.

Abstract: We present a concise derivation for several influential score-based diffusion models that relies on only a few textbook results. Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful tools for generating realistic, synthetic signals -- particularly natural images -- and often play a role in state-of-the-art algorithms for inverse problems in image processing. While these algorithms are often surprisingly simple, the theory behind them is not, and multiple complex theoretical justifications exist in the literature. Here, we provide a simple and largely self-contained theoretical justification for score-based diffusion models that is targeted towards the signal processing community. This approach leads to generic algorithmic templates for training and generating samples with diffusion models. We show that several influential diffusion models correspond to particular choices within these templates and demonstrate that alternative, more straightforward algorithmic choices can provide comparable results. This approach has the added benefit of enabling conditional sampling without any likelihood approximation.

Abstract: Effectively utilizing extensive unlabeled high-density EEG data to improve performance in scenarios with limited labeled low-density EEG data presents a significant challenge. In this paper, we address this challenge by formulating it as a graph transfer learning and knowledge distillation problem. We propose a Unified Pre-trained Graph Contrastive Masked Autoencoder Distiller, named EEG-DisGCMAE, to bridge the gap between unlabeled and labeled as well as high- and low-density EEG data. Our approach introduces a novel unified graph self-supervised pre-training paradigm, which seamlessly integrates the graph contrastive pre-training with the graph masked autoencoder pre-training. Furthermore, we propose a graph topology distillation loss function, allowing a lightweight student model trained on low-density data to learn from a teacher model trained on high-density data during pre-training and fine-tuning. This method effectively handles missing electrodes through contrastive distillation. We validate the effectiveness of EEG-DisGCMAE across four classification tasks using two clinical EEG datasets with abundant data. The source code is available at https://github.com/weixinxu666/EEG_DisGCMAE.

Abstract: Recent generative models based on score matching and flow matching have significantly advanced generation tasks, but their potential in discriminative tasks remains underexplored. Previous approaches, such as generative classifiers, have not fully leveraged the capabilities of these models for discriminative tasks due to their intricate designs. We propose Pretrained Reversible Generation (PRG), which extracts unsupervised representations by reversing the generative process of a pretrained continuous generation model. PRG effectively reuses unsupervised generative models, leveraging their high capacity to serve as robust and generalizable feature extractors for downstream tasks. This framework enables the flexible selection of feature hierarchies tailored to specific downstream tasks. Our method consistently outperforms prior approaches across multiple benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance among generative model based methods, including 78% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet at a resolution of 64*64. Extensive ablation studies, including out-of-distribution evaluations, further validate the effectiveness of our approach.PRG is available at https://github.com/opendilab/PRG.

Abstract: We introduce RandAR, a decoder-only visual autoregressive (AR) model capable of generating images in arbitrary token orders. Unlike previous decoder-only AR models that rely on a predefined generation order, RandAR removes this inductive bias, unlocking new capabilities in decoder-only generation. Our essential design enables random order by inserting a "position instruction token" before each image token to be predicted, representing the spatial location of the next image token. Trained on randomly permuted token sequences -- a more challenging task than fixed-order generation, RandAR achieves comparable performance to its conventional raster-order counterpart. More importantly, decoder-only transformers trained from random orders acquire new capabilities. For the efficiency bottleneck of AR models, RandAR adopts parallel decoding with KV-Cache at inference time, enjoying 2.5x acceleration without sacrificing generation quality. Additionally, RandAR supports inpainting, outpainting and resolution extrapolation in a zero-shot manner. We hope RandAR inspires new directions for decoder-only visual generation models and broadens their applications across diverse scenarios. Our project page is at https://rand-ar.github.io/.

Abstract: Digital agents for automating tasks across different platforms by directly manipulating the GUIs are increasingly important. For these agents, grounding from language instructions to target elements remains a significant challenge due to reliance on HTML or AXTree inputs. In this paper, we introduce Aria-UI, a large multimodal model specifically designed for GUI grounding. Aria-UI adopts a pure-vision approach, eschewing reliance on auxiliary inputs. To adapt to heterogeneous planning instructions, we propose a scalable data pipeline that synthesizes diverse and high-quality instruction samples for grounding. To handle dynamic contexts in task performing, Aria-UI incorporates textual and text-image interleaved action histories, enabling robust context-aware reasoning for grounding. Aria-UI sets new state-of-the-art results across offline and online agent benchmarks, outperforming both vision-only and AXTree-reliant baselines. We release all training data and model checkpoints to foster further research at https://ariaui.github.io.

Abstract: In situ robotic automation in construction is challenging due to constantly changing environments, a shortage of robotic experts, and a lack of standardized frameworks bridging robotics and construction practices. This work proposes a holistic framework for construction task specification, optimization of robot morphology, and mission execution using a mobile modular reconfigurable robot. Users can specify and monitor the desired robot behavior through a graphical interface. In contrast to existing, monolithic solutions, we automatically identify a new task-tailored robot for every task by integrating \acf{bim}. Our framework leverages modular robot components that enable the fast adaption of robot hardware to the specific demands of the construction task. Other than previous works on modular robot optimization, we consider multiple competing objectives, which allow us to explicitly model the challenges of real-world transfer, such as calibration errors. We demonstrate our framework in simulation by optimizing robots for drilling and spray painting. Finally, experimental validation demonstrates that our approach robustly enables the autonomous execution of robotic drilling.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding (3DVG) involves localizing entities in a 3D scene referred to by natural language text. Such models are useful for embodied AI and scene retrieval applications, which involve searching for objects or patterns using natural language descriptions. While recent works have focused on LLM-based scaling of 3DVG datasets, these datasets do not capture the full range of potential prompts which could be specified in the English language. To ensure that we are scaling up and testing against a useful and representative set of prompts, we propose a framework for linguistically analyzing 3DVG prompts and introduce Visual Grounding with Diverse Language in 3D (ViGiL3D), a diagnostic dataset for evaluating visual grounding methods against a diverse set of language patterns. We evaluate existing open-vocabulary 3DVG methods to demonstrate that these methods are not yet proficient in understanding and identifying the targets of more challenging, out-of-distribution prompts, toward real-world applications.

Abstract: Robot sports, characterized by well-defined objectives, explicit rules, and dynamic interactions, present ideal scenarios for demonstrating embodied intelligence. In this paper, we present VolleyBots, a novel robot sports testbed where multiple drones cooperate and compete in the sport of volleyball under physical dynamics. VolleyBots integrates three features within a unified platform: competitive and cooperative gameplay, turn-based interaction structure, and agile 3D maneuvering. Competitive and cooperative gameplay challenges each drone to coordinate with its teammates while anticipating and countering opposing teams' tactics. Turn-based interaction demands precise timing, accurate state prediction, and management of long-horizon temporal dependencies. Agile 3D maneuvering requires rapid accelerations, sharp turns, and precise 3D positioning despite the quadrotor's underactuated dynamics. These intertwined features yield a complex problem combining motion control and strategic play, with no available expert demonstrations. We provide a comprehensive suite of tasks ranging from single-drone drills to multi-drone cooperative and competitive tasks, accompanied by baseline evaluations of representative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and game-theoretic algorithms. Simulation results show that on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) methods outperform off-policy methods in single-agent tasks, but both approaches struggle in complex tasks that combine motion control and strategic play. We additionally design a hierarchical policy which achieves a 69.5% percent win rate against the strongest baseline in the 3 vs 3 task, underscoring its potential as an effective solution for tackling the complex interplay between low-level control and high-level strategy.

Abstract: We introduce DeepCell, a novel circuit representation learning framework that effectively integrates multiview information from both And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs) and Post-Mapping (PM) netlists. At its core, DeepCell employs a self-supervised Mask Circuit Modeling (MCM) strategy, inspired by masked language modeling, to fuse complementary circuit representations from different design stages into unified and rich embeddings. To our knowledge, DeepCell is the first framework explicitly designed for PM netlist representation learning, setting new benchmarks in both predictive accuracy and reconstruction quality. We demonstrate the practical efficacy of DeepCell by applying it to critical EDA tasks such as functional Engineering Change Orders (ECO) and technology mapping. Extensive experimental results show that DeepCell significantly surpasses state-of-the-art open-source EDA tools in efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Learning to sample from complex unnormalized distributions over discrete domains emerged as a promising research direction with applications in statistical physics, variational inference, and combinatorial optimization. Recent work has demonstrated the potential of diffusion models in this domain. However, existing methods face limitations in memory scaling and thus the number of attainable diffusion steps since they require backpropagation through the entire generative process. To overcome these limitations we introduce two novel training methods for discrete diffusion samplers, one grounded in the policy gradient theorem and the other one leveraging Self-Normalized Neural Importance Sampling (SN-NIS). These methods yield memory-efficient training and achieve state-of-the-art results in unsupervised combinatorial optimization. Numerous scientific applications additionally require the ability of unbiased sampling. We introduce adaptations of SN-NIS and Neural Markov Chain Monte Carlo that enable for the first time the application of discrete diffusion models to this problem. We validate our methods on Ising model benchmarks and find that they outperform popular autoregressive approaches. Our work opens new avenues for applying diffusion models to a wide range of scientific applications in discrete domains that were hitherto restricted to exact likelihood models.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in datasets is a longstanding problem in machine learning. In this context, anomalies are defined as a sample that significantly deviates from the remaining data. Meanwhile, optimal transport (OT) is a field of mathematics concerned with the transportation, between two probability measures, at least effort. In classical OT, the optimal transportation strategy of a measure to itself is the identity. In this paper, we tackle anomaly detection by forcing samples to displace its mass, while keeping the least effort objective. We call this new transportation problem Mass Repulsing Optimal Transport (MROT). Naturally, samples lying in low density regions of space will be forced to displace mass very far, incurring a higher transportation cost. We use these concepts to design a new anomaly score. Through a series of experiments in existing benchmarks, and fault detection problems, we show that our algorithm improves over existing methods.

Abstract: The success of large generative models has driven a paradigm shift, leveraging massive multi-source data to enhance model capabilities. However, the interaction among these sources remains theoretically underexplored. This paper takes the first step toward a rigorous analysis of multi-source training in conditional generative modeling, where each condition represents a distinct data source. Specifically, we establish a general distribution estimation error bound in average total variation distance for conditional maximum likelihood estimation based on the bracketing number. Our result shows that when source distributions share certain similarities and the model is expressive enough, multi-source training guarantees a sharper bound than single-source training. We further instantiate the general theory on conditional Gaussian estimation and deep generative models including autoregressive and flexible energy-based models, by characterizing their bracketing numbers. The results highlight that the number of sources and similarity among source distributions improve the advantage of multi-source training. Simulations and real-world experiments are conducted to validate the theory, with code available at: https://github.com/ML-GSAI/Multi-Source-GM.

arXiv:2502.15006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A common problem when using model predictive control (MPC) in practice is the satisfaction of safety specifications beyond the prediction horizon. While theoretical works have shown that safety can be guaranteed by enforcing a suitable terminal set constraint or a sufficiently long prediction horizon, these techniques are difficult to apply and thus are rarely used by practitioners, especially in the case of general nonlinear dynamics. To solve this problem, we impose a tradeoff between exact recursive feasibility, computational tractability, and applicability to ``black-box'' dynamics by learning an approximate discrete-time control barrier function and incorporating it into a variational inference MPC (VIMPC), a sampling-based MPC paradigm. To handle the resulting state constraints, we further propose a new sampling strategy that greatly reduces the variance of the estimated optimal control, improving the sample efficiency, and enabling real-time planning on a CPU. The resulting Neural Shield-VIMPC (NS-VIMPC) controller yields substantial safety improvements compared to existing sampling-based MPC controllers, even under badly designed cost functions. We validate our approach in both simulation and real-world hardware experiments. Project website: https://mit-realm.github.io/ns-vimpc/.

Abstract: Heart failure is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, with millons of deaths each year, according to data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and other public health agencies. While significant progress has been made in the field of heart failure, leading to improved survival rates and improvement of ejection fraction, there remains substantial unmet needs, due to the complexity and multifactorial characteristics. Therefore, we propose a composable strategy framework for assessment and treatment optimization in heart failure. This framework simulates the doctor-patient consultation process and leverages multi-modal algorithms to analyze a range of data, including video, physical examination, text results as well as medical history. By integrating these various data sources, our framework offers a more holistic evaluation and optimized treatment plan for patients. Our results demonstrate that this multi-modal approach outperforms single-modal artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in terms of accuracy in heart failure (HF) prognosis prediction. Through this method, we can further evaluate the impact of various pathological indicators on HF prognosis,providing a more comprehensive evaluation.

Abstract: Language diversity presents a significant challenge in speech-to-text (S2T) tasks, such as automatic speech recognition and translation. Traditional multi-lingual multi-task training approaches aim to address this by jointly optimising multiple speech recognition and translation tasks across various languages. While models like Whisper, built on these strategies, demonstrate strong performance, they still face issues of high computational cost, language interference, suboptimal training configurations, and limited extensibility. To overcome these challenges, we introduce LoRS-Merging (low-rank and sparse model merging), a novel technique designed to efficiently integrate models trained on different languages or tasks while preserving performance and reducing computational overhead. LoRS-Merging combines low-rank and sparse pruning to retain essential structures while eliminating redundant parameters, mitigating language interference, and enhancing extensibility. Experimental results across 10 languages demonstrate that LoRS-Merging significantly outperforms multi-lingual multi-task training, sequential training, and other merging methods, achieving over 20% improvement in normalised performance. Our findings suggest that model merging, particularly LoRS-Merging, is a scalable and effective complement to traditional multi-lingual training strategies for S2T applications.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of image generation, achieving precise control over generated content and maintaining semantic consistency remain significant limitations, particularly concerning grounding techniques and the necessity for model fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose BayesGenie, an off-the-shelf approach that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Bayesian Optimization to facilitate precise and user-friendly image editing. Our method enables users to modify images through natural language descriptions without manual area marking, while preserving the original image's semantic integrity. Unlike existing techniques that require extensive pre-training or fine-tuning, our approach demonstrates remarkable adaptability across various LLMs through its model-agnostic design. BayesGenie employs an adapted Bayesian optimization strategy to automatically refine the inference process parameters, achieving high-precision image editing with minimal user intervention. Through extensive experiments across diverse scenarios, we demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in both editing accuracy and semantic preservation, as validated using different LLMs including Claude3 and GPT-4.

Abstract: Risk-sensitive planning aims to identify policies maximizing some tail-focused metrics in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Such an optimization task can be very costly for the most widely used and interpretable metrics such as threshold probabilities or (Conditional) Values at Risk. Indeed, previous work showed that only Entropic Risk Measures (EntRM) can be efficiently optimized through dynamic programming, leaving a hard-to-interpret parameter to choose. We show that the computation of the full set of optimal policies for EntRM across parameter values leads to tight approximations for the metrics of interest. We prove that this optimality front can be computed effectively thanks to a novel structural analysis and smoothness properties of entropic risks. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance in a variety of decision-making scenarios.

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) focuses on providing answers to natural language questions by utilizing information from images. Although cutting-edge multimodal large language models (MLLMs) such as GPT-4o achieve strong performance on VQA tasks, they frequently fall short in accessing domain-specific or the latest knowledge. To mitigate this issue, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) leveraging external knowledge bases (KBs), referred to as KB-VQA, emerges as a promising approach. Nevertheless, conventional unimodal retrieval techniques, which translate images into textual descriptions, often result in the loss of critical visual details. To address these challenges, this study presents two key innovations. First, we introduce fine-grained knowledge units that consist of multimodal data fragments (e.g. text fragments, entity images, and so on) in a structured manner. Rather than merely refining retrieval mechanisms, we prioritize the systematic organization and management of these knowledge units, ensuring that the structuring process itself enhances retrieval quality. Second, we propose a knowledge unit retrieval-augmented generation framework (KU-RAG) that seamlessly integrates fine-grained retrieval with MLLMs. Our KU-RAG framework not only ensures precise retrieval of relevant knowledge but also enhances reasoning capabilities through a knowledge correction chain. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing KB-VQA methods across four benchmarks, achieving an average improvement of approximately 3% and up to 11% in the best case.

Abstract: Self-play alignment has emerged as an effective approach for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), formulating preference optimization as a two-player game. However, the regularization with respect to the reference policy, which is crucial for mitigating over-optimization, has been insufficiently investigated in self-play alignment. To study the impact of different regularization strategies, we propose \textbf{Regularized Self-Play Policy Optimization (RSPO)}, a general and modular framework that unifies prior methods and enables simple plug-and-play integration of various regularizers, meanwhile preserving convergence to Nash equilibrium of the corresponding regularized game.Our empirical study involving over $120$ fine-tuned Mistral-7B-Instruct models reveals that forward KL divergence regularization reduces response length, whereas reverse KL divergence markedly improves raw win rates. Crucially, RSPO regularized with a linear combination of forward and reverse KL divergence significantly boosts the length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval-2 from $28.5\%$ (unregularized self-play, SPPO) to $35.4\%$, and consistently demonstrates superior performance on Arena-Hard, MT-Bench, ArmoRM scores, and response diversity. Combining simplicity, convergence guarantees, and significant empirical gains, RSPO offers a strong foundation for exploring regularized self-play in language model alignment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination stemming from misaligned self-awareness, particularly when processing queries exceeding their knowledge boundaries. While existing mitigation strategies employ uncertainty estimation or query rejection mechanisms, they suffer from computational efficiency and sacrificed helpfulness. To address these issues, we propose the Explicit Knowledge Boundary Modeling (EKBM) framework, integrating fast and slow reasoning systems to harmonize reliability and usability. The framework first employs a fast-thinking model to generate confidence-labeled responses, enabling immediate utilization of high-confidence outputs, whereas uncertain predictions trigger a slow refinement model for accuracy improvement. To align model behavior with our proposed object, we propose a hybrid training pipeline, enhancing self-awareness without degrading task performance. Evaluations on dialogue state tracking tasks demonstrate that EKBM achieves superior model reliability over uncertainty-based baselines. Further analysis reveals that refinement substantially boosts accuracy while maintaining low computational overhead. The framework establishes a scalable paradigm for deploying reliable LLMs in error-sensitive applications, effectively balancing accuracy and practical utility.

Abstract: Integrating structured graph data with rich textual information from nodes poses a significant challenge, particularly for heterophilic node classification. Current approaches often struggle with computational costs or effective fusion of disparate modalities. We propose \textbf{Graph Masked Language Model (GMLM)}, a novel architecture efficiently combining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). GMLM introduces three key innovations: (i) a \textbf{dynamic active node selection} strategy for scalable PLM text processing; (ii) a GNN-specific \textbf{contrastive pretraining stage} using soft masking with a learnable graph \texttt{[MASK]} token for robust structural representations; and (iii) a \textbf{dedicated fusion module} integrating RGCN-based GNN embeddings with PLM (GTE-Small \& DistilBERT) embeddings. Extensive experiments on heterophilic benchmarks (Cornell, Wisconsin, Texas) demonstrate GMLM's superiority. Notably, GMLM(DistilBERT) achieves significant performance gains, improving accuracy by over \textbf{4.7\%} on Cornell and over \textbf{2.0\%} on Texas compared to the previous best-performing baselines. This work underscores the benefits of targeted PLM engagement and modality-specific pretraining for improved, efficient learning on text-rich graphs.

<title>Zero-shot Medical Event Prediction Using a Generative Pre-trained Transformer on Electronic Health Records</title>

Abstract: Longitudinal data in electronic health records (EHRs) represent an individual`s clinical history through a sequence of codified concepts, including diagnoses, procedures, medications, and laboratory tests. Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) can leverage this data to predict future events. While fine-tuning of these models can enhance task-specific performance, it becomes costly when applied to many clinical prediction tasks. In contrast, a pretrained foundation model can be used in zero-shot forecasting setting, offering a scalable alternative to fine-tuning separate models for each outcome.
  This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of zero-shot forecasting with GPT-based foundational models in EHRs, introducing a novel pipeline that formulates medical concept prediction as a generative modeling task. Unlike supervised approaches requiring extensive labeled data, our method enables the model to forecast a next medical event purely from a pretraining knowledge. We evaluate performance across multiple time horizons and clinical categories, demonstrating model`s ability to capture latent temporal dependencies and complex patient trajectories without task supervision.
  Model performance for predicting the next medical concept was evaluated using precision and recall metrics, achieving an average top1 precision of 0.614 and recall of 0.524. For 12 major diagnostic conditions, the model demonstrated strong zero-shot performance, achieving high true positive rates while maintaining low false positives.
  We demonstrate the power of a foundational EHR GPT model in capturing diverse phenotypes and enabling robust, zero-shot forecasting of clinical outcomes. This capability enhances the versatility of predictive healthcare models and reduces the need for task-specific training, enabling more scalable applications in clinical settings.

Abstract: Traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from replicating human-like behaviors, generalizing effectively in multi-agent scenarios, and overcoming inherent interpretability issues.These tasks are compounded when deep environment understanding, agent coordination and dynamic optimization are required. While Large Language Model (LLM) enhanced methods have shown promise in generalization and interoperability, they often neglect necessary multi-agent coordination. Therefore, we introduce the Cascading Cooperative Multi-agent (CCMA) framework, integrating RL for individual interactions, a fine-tuned LLM for regional cooperation, a reward function for global optimization, and the Retrieval-augmented Generation mechanism to dynamically optimize decision-making across complex driving scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that the CCMA outperforms existing RL methods, demonstrating significant improvements in both micro and macro-level performance in complex driving environments.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence transforms public sector operations, governments struggle to integrate technological innovations into coherent systems for effective service delivery. This paper introduces the Algorithmic State Architecture (ASA), a novel four-layer framework conceptualising how Digital Public Infrastructure, Data-for-Policy, Algorithmic Government/Governance, and GovTech interact as an integrated system in AI-enabled states. Unlike approaches that treat these as parallel developments, ASA positions them as interdependent layers with specific enabling relationships and feedback mechanisms. Through comparative analysis of implementations in Estonia, Singapore, India, and the UK, we demonstrate how foundational digital infrastructure enables systematic data collection, which powers algorithmic decision-making processes, ultimately manifesting in user-facing services. Our analysis reveals that successful implementations require balanced development across all layers, with particular attention to integration mechanisms between them. The framework contributes to both theory and practice by bridging previously disconnected domains of digital government research, identifying critical dependencies that influence implementation success, and providing a structured approach for analysing the maturity and development pathways of AI-enabled government systems.

Abstract: With the rapid development of diffusion models in image generation, the demand for more powerful and flexible controllable frameworks is increasing. Although existing methods can guide generation beyond text prompts, the challenge of effectively combining multiple conditional inputs while maintaining consistency with all of them remains unsolved. To address this, we introduce UniCombine, a DiT-based multi-conditional controllable generative framework capable of handling any combination of conditions, including but not limited to text prompts, spatial maps, and subject images. Specifically, we introduce a novel Conditional MMDiT Attention mechanism and incorporate a trainable LoRA module to build both the training-free and training-based versions. Additionally, we propose a new pipeline to construct SubjectSpatial200K, the first dataset designed for multi-conditional generative tasks covering both the subject-driven and spatially-aligned conditions. Extensive experimental results on multi-conditional generation demonstrate the outstanding universality and powerful capability of our approach with state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in digital platforms used by youth has created significant challenges related to privacy, autonomy, and data protection. While AI-driven personalization offers enhanced user experiences, it often operates without clear ethical boundaries, leaving young users vulnerable to data exploitation and algorithmic biases. This paper presents a call to action for ethical AI governance, advocating for a structured framework that ensures youth-centred privacy protections, transparent data practices, and regulatory oversight. We outline key areas requiring urgent intervention, including algorithmic transparency, privacy education, parental data-sharing ethics, and accountability measures. Through this approach, we seek to empower youth with greater control over their digital identities and propose actionable strategies for policymakers, AI developers, and educators to build a fairer and more accountable AI ecosystem.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based on Transformer have been widely applied in the filed of natural language processing (NLP), demonstrating strong performance, particularly in handling short text tasks. However, when it comes to long context scenarios, the performance of LLMs degrades due to some challenges. To alleviate this phenomenon, there is a number of work proposed recently. In this survey, we first list the challenges of applying pre-trained LLMs to process long contexts. Then systematically review the approaches related to long context and propose our taxonomy categorizing them into four main types: positional encoding, context compression, retrieval augmented, and attention pattern. In addition to the approaches, we focus on the evaluation of long context, organizing relevant data, tasks, and metrics based on existing long context benchmarks. Finally, we summarize unresolved issues in the long context domain and put forward our views on future developments.

<title>Analytic Subspace Routing: How Recursive Least Squares Works in Continual Learning of Large Language Model</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess encompassing capabilities that can process diverse language-related tasks. However, finetuning on LLMs will diminish this general skills and continual finetuning will further cause severe degradation on accumulated knowledge. Recently, Continual Learning (CL) in Large Language Models (LLMs) arises which aims to continually adapt the LLMs to new tasks while maintaining previously learned knowledge and inheriting general skills. Existing techniques either leverage previous data to replay, leading to extra computational costs, or utilize a single parameter-efficient module to learn the downstream task, constraining new knowledge absorption with interference between different tasks. Toward these issues, this paper proposes Analytic Subspace Routing(ASR) to address these challenges. For each task, we isolate the learning within a subspace of deep layers' features via low-rank adaptation, eliminating knowledge interference between different tasks. Additionally, we propose an analytic routing mechanism to properly utilize knowledge learned in different subspaces. Our approach employs Recursive Least Squares to train a multi-task router model, allowing the router to dynamically adapt to incoming data without requiring access to historical data. Also, the router effectively assigns the current task to an appropriate subspace and has a non-forgetting property of previously learned tasks with a solid theoretical guarantee. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves near-perfect retention of prior knowledge while seamlessly integrating new information, effectively overcoming the core limitations of existing methods. Our code will be released after acceptance.

Abstract: Fire and smoke phenomena pose a significant threat to the natural environment, ecosystems, and global economy, as well as human lives and wildlife. In this particular circumstance, there is a demand for more sophisticated and advanced technologies to implement an effective strategy for early detection, real-time monitoring, and minimizing the overall impacts of fires on ecological balance and public safety. Recently, the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Vision (CV) frameworks has substantially revolutionized the momentum for developing efficient fire management systems. However, these systems extensively rely on the availability of adequate and high-quality fire and smoke data to create proficient Machine Learning (ML) methods for various tasks, such as detection and monitoring. Although fire and smoke datasets play a critical role in training, evaluating, and testing advanced Deep Learning (DL) models, a comprehensive review of the existing datasets is still unexplored. For this purpose, we provide an in-depth review to systematically analyze and evaluate fire and smoke datasets collected over the past 20 years. We investigate the characteristics of each dataset, including type, size, format, collection methods, and geographical diversities. We also review and highlight the unique features of each dataset, such as imaging modalities (RGB, thermal, infrared) and their applicability for different fire management tasks (classification, segmentation, detection). Furthermore, we summarize the strengths and weaknesses of each dataset and discuss their potential for advancing research and technology in fire management. Ultimately, we conduct extensive experimental analyses across different datasets using several state-of-the-art algorithms, such as ResNet-50, DeepLab-V3, and YoloV8.

Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technologies and wearable devices, egocentric vision understanding has emerged as a new and challenging research direction, gradually attracting widespread attention from both academia and industry. Egocentric vision captures visual and multimodal data through cameras or sensors worn on the human body, offering a unique perspective that simulates human visual experiences. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the research on egocentric vision understanding, systematically analyzing the components of egocentric scenes and categorizing the tasks into four main areas: subject understanding, object understanding, environment understanding, and hybrid understanding. We explore in detail the sub-tasks within each category. We also summarize the main challenges and trends currently existing in the field. Furthermore, this paper presents an overview of high-quality egocentric vision datasets, offering valuable resources for future research. By summarizing the latest advancements, we anticipate the broad applications of egocentric vision technologies in fields such as augmented reality, virtual reality, and embodied intelligence, and propose future research directions based on the latest developments in the field.

arXiv:2503.22968v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Korean large language models (LLMs) have driven numerous benchmarks and evaluation methods, yet inconsistent protocols cause up to 10 p.p performance gaps across institutions. Overcoming these reproducibility gaps does not mean enforcing a one-size-fits-all evaluation. Rather, effective benchmarking requires diverse experimental approaches and a framework robust enough to support them. To this end, we introduce HRET (Haerae Evaluation Toolkit), an open-source, registry-based framework that unifies Korean LLM assessment. HRET integrates major Korean benchmarks, multiple inference backends, and multi-method evaluation, with language consistency enforcement to ensure genuine Korean outputs. Its modular registry design also enables rapid incorporation of new datasets, methods, and backends, ensuring the toolkit adapts to evolving research needs. Beyond standard accuracy metrics, HRET incorporates Korean-focused output analyses-morphology-aware Type-Token Ratio (TTR) for evaluating lexical diversity and systematic keyword-omission detection for identifying missing concepts-to provide diagnostic insights into language-specific behaviors. These targeted analyses help researchers pinpoint morphological and semantic shortcomings in model outputs, guiding focused improvements in Korean LLM development.

Abstract: Leveraging inference-time search in large language models has proven effective in further enhancing a trained model's capability to solve complex mathematical and reasoning problems. However, this approach significantly increases computational costs and inference time, as the model must generate and evaluate multiple candidate solutions to identify a viable reasoning path. To address this, we propose an effective approach that integrates search capabilities directly into the model by fine-tuning it on unpaired successful (learning) and failed reasoning paths (forgetting) derived from diverse search methods. A key challenge we identify is that naive fine-tuning can degrade the model's search capability; we show this can be mitigated with a smaller learning rate. Extensive experiments on the challenging Game-of-24 and Countdown reasoning benchmarks show that, replacing CoT-generated data with search-generated data for offline fine-tuning improves success rates by around 23% over inference-time search baselines, while reducing inference time by 180$\times$. On top of this, our learning and forgetting objective consistently outperforms both supervised fine-tuning and preference-based methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable performance across various natural language processing tasks but suffer from immense computational and memory demands, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address this challenge, we propose NoWag: (Normalized Weight and Activation Guided Compression), a unified framework for zero-shot shape preserving compression algorithms. We compressed Llama-2 7B/13B/70B and Llama-3 8/70BB models, using two popular forms of shape-preserving compression, vector quantization NoWag-VQ (NoWag for Vector Quantization), and unstructured/semi-structured pruning NoWag-P (NoWag for Pruning). We found that NoWag-VQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art zero shot VQ, and that NoWag-P performs competitively against state-of-the-art methods. These results suggest commonalities between these compression paradigms that could inspire future work. Our code is available at https://github.com/LawrenceRLiu/NoWag

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) process images as a whole. Since adjacent pixels are highly likely to belong to the same object, we propose the Heat Diffusion Model (HDM) to further preserve image details and generate more realistic images. HDM essentially is a DDPM that incorporates an attention mechanism between pixels. In HDM, the discrete form of the two-dimensional heat equation is integrated into the diffusion and generation formulas of DDPM, enabling the model to compute relationships between neighboring pixels during image processing. Our experiments demonstrate that HDM can generate higher-quality samples compared to models such as DDPM, Consistency Diffusion Models (CDM), Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), and Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Networks (VQGAN).

Abstract: The performance of Offline reinforcement learning is significantly impacted by the issue of state distributional shift, and out-of-distribution (OOD) state correction is a popular approach to address this problem. In this paper, we propose a novel method named Density-Aware Safety Perception (DASP) for OOD state correction. Specifically, our method encourages the agent to prioritize actions that lead to outcomes with higher data density, thereby promoting its operation within or the return to in-distribution (safe) regions. To achieve this, we optimize the objective within a variational framework that concurrently considers both the potential outcomes of decision-making and their density, thus providing crucial contextual information for safe decision-making. Finally, we validate the effectiveness and feasibility of our proposed method through extensive experimental evaluations on the offline MuJoCo and AntMaze suites.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is revolutionizing education and workforce development, profoundly shaping how students learn, engage, and prepare for their future. Outpacing the development of uniform policies and structures, GenAI has heralded a unique era and given rise to the GenAI Generation. We define the GenAI Generation as a cohort of students whose education has been increasingly shaped by the opportunities and challenges GenAI presents during its widespread adoption within society. This study examines students' perceptions of GenAI through a concise survey with optional open-ended questions, focusing on their awareness, preparedness, and concerns. Notably, readiness appears increasingly tied to exposure to GenAI through one's coursework. Students with greater curricular exposure to GenAI tend to feel more prepared, while those without it more often express vulnerability and uncertainty, highlighting a new and growing divide in readiness that goes beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries. Evaluation of more than 250 responses, with over 40% providing detailed qualitative feedback, reveals a core dual sentiment: while most students express enthusiasm for GenAI, an even greater proportion voice a spectrum of concerns about ethics, job displacement, and the adequacy of educational structures given the highly transformative technology. These findings offer critical insights into how students view the potential and pitfalls of GenAI for future career impacts. The challenge ahead involves implementing associated recommendations for educational institutions, moving beyond the baseline of access toward more informed guidance on the use of these tools, while preserving critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and adaptive learning.

Abstract: Generative language modelling has surged in popularity with the emergence of services such as ChatGPT and Google Gemini. While these models have demonstrated transformative potential in productivity and communication, they overwhelmingly cater to high-resource languages like English. This has amplified concerns over linguistic inequality in natural language processing (NLP). This paper presents the first systematic review focused specifically on strategies to address data scarcity in generative language modelling for low-resource languages (LRL). Drawing from 54 studies, we identify, categorise and evaluate technical approaches, including monolingual data augmentation, back-translation, multilingual training, and prompt engineering, across generative tasks. We also analyse trends in architecture choices, language family representation, and evaluation methods. Our findings highlight a strong reliance on transformer-based models, a concentration on a small subset of LRLs, and a lack of consistent evaluation across studies. We conclude with recommendations for extending these methods to a wider range of LRLs and outline open challenges in building equitable generative language systems. Ultimately, this review aims to support researchers and developers in building inclusive AI tools for underrepresented languages, a necessary step toward empowering LRL speakers and the preservation of linguistic diversity in a world increasingly shaped by large-scale language technologies.

Abstract: Diffusion policies, widely adopted in decision-making scenarios such as robotics, gaming and autonomous driving, are capable of learning diverse skills from demonstration data due to their high representation power. However, the sub-optimal and limited coverage of demonstration data could lead to diffusion policies that generate sub-optimal trajectories and even catastrophic failures. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a promising solution to address these limitations, existing approaches struggle to effectively adapt Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to diffusion models. This challenge stems from the computational intractability of action likelihood estimation during the denoising process, which leads to complicated optimization objectives. In our experiments starting from randomly initialized policies, we find that online tuning of Diffusion Policies demonstrates much lower sample efficiency compared to directly applying PPO on MLP policies (MLP+PPO). To address these challenges, we introduce NCDPO, a novel framework that reformulates Diffusion Policy as a noise-conditioned deterministic policy. By treating each denoising step as a differentiable transformation conditioned on pre-sampled noise, NCDPO enables tractable likelihood evaluation and gradient backpropagation through all diffusion timesteps. Our experiments demonstrate that NCDPO achieves sample efficiency comparable to MLP+PPO when training from scratch, outperforming existing methods in both sample efficiency and final performance across diverse benchmarks, including continuous robot control and multi-agent game scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results show that our method is robust to the number denoising timesteps in the Diffusion Policy.

Abstract: We propose Bayesian Hierarchical Invariant Prediction (BHIP) reframing Invariant Causal Prediction (ICP) through the lens of Hierarchical Bayes. We leverage the hierarchical structure to explicitly test invariance of causal mechanisms under heterogeneous data, resulting in improved computational scalability for a larger number of predictors compared to ICP. Moreover, given its Bayesian nature BHIP enables the use of prior information. In this paper, we test two sparsity inducing priors: horseshoe and spike-and-slab, both of which allow us a more reliable identification of causal features. We test BHIP in synthetic and real-world data showing its potential as an alternative inference method to ICP.

Abstract: During football matches, a variety of different parties (e.g., companies) each collect (possibly overlapping) data about the match ranging from basic information (e.g., starting players) to detailed positional data. This data is provided to clubs, federations, and other organizations who are increasingly interested in leveraging this data to inform their decision making. Unfortunately, analyzing such data pose significant barriers because each provider may (1) collect different data, (2) use different specifications even within the same category of data, (3) represent the data differently, and (4) delivers the data in a different manner (e.g., file format, protocol). Consequently, working with these data requires a significant investment of time and money. The goal of this work is to propose a uniform and standardized format for football data called the Common Data Format (CDF). The CDF specifies a minimal schema for five types of match data: match sheet data, video footage, event data, tracking data, and match meta data. It aims to ensure that the provided data is clear, sufficiently contextualized (e.g., its provenance is clear), and complete such that it enables common downstream analysis tasks. Concretely, this paper will detail the technical specifications of the CDF, the representational choices that were made to help ensure the clarity of the provided data, and a concrete approach for delivering data in the CDF. This represents Version 1.0.0 of the CDF.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) and their extension, vision-language models (VLMs), have achieved remarkable performance across various tasks. However, they still struggle with complex reasoning tasks that require multimodal or multilingual real-world knowledge. To support such capabilities, an external memory system that can efficiently provide relevant multimodal information is essential. Existing approaches generally concatenate image and text tokens into a long sequence as memory, which, however, may drastically increase context length and even degrade performance. In contrast, we propose using continuous memory, a compact set of dense embeddings to more effectively and efficiently represent multimodal and multilingual knowledge. Our key insight is that a VLM can serve as its own continuous memory encoder. We empirically show that this design improves performance on complex multimodal reasoning tasks. Building on this, we introduce a data-efficient and parameter-efficient method to fine-tune the VLM into a memory encoder, requiring only 1.2% of the model's parameters and a small corpus of 15.6K self-synthesized samples. Our approach CoMEM utilizes VLM's original capabilities to encode arbitrary multimodal and multilingual knowledge into just 8 continuous embeddings. Since the inference-time VLM remains frozen, our memory module is plug-and-play and can be flexibly integrated as needed. Extensive experiments across eight multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Humans practice slow thinking before performing actual actions when handling complex tasks in the physical world. This thinking paradigm, recently, has achieved remarkable advancement in boosting Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks in digital domains. However, the potential of slow thinking remains largely unexplored for robotic foundation models interacting with the physical world. In this work, we propose Hume: a dual-system Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with value-guided System-2 thinking and cascaded action denoising, exploring human-like thinking capabilities of Vision-Language-Action models for dexterous robot control. System 2 of Hume implements value-Guided thinking by extending a Vision-Language-Action Model backbone with a novel value-query head to estimate the state-action value of predicted actions. The value-guided thinking is conducted by repeat sampling multiple action candidates and selecting one according to state-action value. System 1 of Hume is a lightweight reactive visuomotor policy that takes System 2 selected action and performs cascaded action denoising for dexterous robot control. At deployment time, System 2 performs value-guided thinking at a low frequency while System 1 asynchronously receives the System 2 selected action candidate and predicts fluid actions in real time. We show that Hume outperforms the existing state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action models across multiple simulation benchmark and real-robot deployments.

Abstract: We propose EEG2TEXT-CN, which, to the best of our knowledge, represents one of the earliest open-vocabulary EEG-to-text generation frameworks tailored for Chinese. Built on a biologically grounded EEG encoder (NICE-EEG) and a compact pretrained language model (MiniLM), our architecture aligns multichannel brain signals with natural language representations via masked pretraining and contrastive learning. Using a subset of the ChineseEEG dataset, where each sentence contains approximately ten Chinese characters aligned with 128-channel EEG recorded at 256 Hz, we segment EEG into per-character embeddings and predict full sentences in a zero-shot setting. The decoder is trained with teacher forcing and padding masks to accommodate variable-length sequences. Evaluation on over 1,500 training-validation sentences and 300 held-out test samples shows promising lexical alignment, with a best BLEU-1 score of 6.38\%. While syntactic fluency remains a challenge, our findings demonstrate the feasibility of non-phonetic, cross-modal language decoding from EEG. This work opens a new direction in multilingual brain-to-text research and lays the foundation for future cognitive-language interfaces in Chinese.

Abstract: Pre-trained neural networks are commonly used and reused in the machine learning community. Alice trains a model for a particular task, and a part of her neural network is reused by Bob for a different task, often to great effect. To what can we ascribe Bob's success? This paper introduces an experimental setup through which factors contributing to Bob's empirical success could be studied in silico. As a result, we demonstrate that Bob might just be lucky: his task accuracy increases monotonically with the correlation between his task and Alice's. Even when Bob has provably uncorrelated tasks and input features from Alice's pre-trained network, he can achieve significantly better than random performance due to Alice's choice of network and optimizer. When there is little correlation between tasks, only reusing lower pre-trained layers is preferable, and we hypothesize the converse: that the optimal number of retrained layers is indicative of task and feature correlation. Finally, we show in controlled real-world scenarios that Bob can effectively reuse Alice's pre-trained network if there are semantic correlations between his and Alice's task.

Abstract: Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) systems employ automatic measures of pronunciation quality, such as the goodness of pronunciation (GOP) metric. GOP relies on forced alignments, which are prone to labeling and segmentation errors due to acoustic variability. While alignment-free methods address these challenges, they are computationally expensive and scale poorly with phoneme sequence length and inventory size. To enhance efficiency, we introduce a substitution-aware alignment-free GOP that restricts phoneme substitutions based on phoneme clusters and common learner errors. We evaluated our GOP on two L2 English speech datasets, one with child speech, My Pronunciation Coach (MPC), and SpeechOcean762, which includes child and adult speech. We compared RPS (restricted phoneme substitutions) and UPS (unrestricted phoneme substitutions) setups within alignment-free methods, which outperformed the baseline. We discuss our results and outline avenues for future research.

Abstract: Accurate and robust pose estimation is a key requirement for any autonomous robot. We present cuVSLAM, a state-of-the-art solution for visual simultaneous localization and mapping, which can operate with a variety of visual-inertial sensor suites, including multiple RGB and depth cameras, and inertial measurement units. cuVSLAM supports operation with as few as one RGB camera to as many as 32 cameras, in arbitrary geometric configurations, thus supporting a wide range of robotic setups. cuVSLAM is specifically optimized using CUDA to deploy in real-time applications with minimal computational overhead on edge-computing devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson. We present the design and implementation of cuVSLAM, example use cases, and empirical results on several state-of-the-art benchmarks demonstrating the best-in-class performance of cuVSLAM.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic's severe impact highlighted the need for accurate and timely hospitalization forecasting to support effective healthcare planning. However, most forecasting models struggled, particularly during variant surges, when they were most needed. This study introduces a novel parallel-stream Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) framework to forecast daily state-level incident hospitalizations in the United States. Our framework incorporates a spatiotemporal feature, Social Proximity to Hospitalizations (SPH), derived from Meta's Social Connectedness Index, to improve forecasts. SPH serves as a proxy for interstate population interaction, capturing transmission dynamics across space and time. Our architecture captures both short- and long-term temporal dependencies, and a multi-horizon ensembling strategy balances forecasting consistency and error. An evaluation against the COVID-19 Forecast Hub ensemble models during the Delta and Omicron surges reveals the superiority of our model. On average, our model surpasses the ensemble by 27, 42, 54, and 69 hospitalizations per state at the 7-, 14-, 21-, and 28-day horizons, respectively, during the Omicron surge. Data-ablation experiments confirm SPH's predictive power, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing forecasting models. This research not only advances hospitalization forecasting but also underscores the significance of spatiotemporal features, such as SPH, in modeling the complex dynamics of infectious disease spread.

Abstract: Modern life has witnessed the explosion of mobile devices. However, besides the valuable features that bring convenience to end users, security and privacy risks still threaten users of mobile apps. The increasing sophistication of these threats in recent years has underscored the need for more advanced and efficient detection approaches. In this chapter, we explore the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify security risks and privacy violations and mitigate them for the mobile application ecosystem. By introducing state-of-the-art research that applied LLMs to mitigate the top 10 common security risks of smartphone platforms, we highlight the feasibility and potential of LLMs to replace traditional analysis methods, such as dynamic and hybrid analysis of mobile apps. As a representative example of LLM-based solutions, we present an approach to detect sensitive data leakage when users share images online, a common behavior of smartphone users nowadays. Finally, we discuss open research challenges.

Abstract: Pronunciation assessment relies on goodness of pronunciation (GOP) scores, traditionally derived from softmax-based posterior probabilities. However, posterior probabilities may suffer from overconfidence and poor phoneme separation, limiting their effectiveness. This study compares logit-based GOP scores with probability-based GOP scores for mispronunciation detection. We conducted our experiment on two L2 English speech datasets spoken by Dutch and Mandarin speakers, assessing classification performance and correlation with human ratings. Logit-based methods outperform probability-based GOP in classification, but their effectiveness depends on dataset characteristics. The maximum logit GOP shows the strongest alignment with human perception, while a combination of different GOP scores balances probability and logit features. The findings suggest that hybrid GOP methods incorporating uncertainty modeling and phoneme-specific weighting improve pronunciation assessment.

Abstract: Controlling the generation of large language models (LLMs) remains a central challenge to ensure their safe and reliable deployment. While prompt engineering and finetuning are common approaches, recent work has explored latent steering, a lightweight technique that alters LLM internal activations to guide generation. However, subsequent studies revealed latent steering's effectiveness to be limited, often underperforming simple instruction prompting. To address this limitation, we first establish a benchmark across diverse behaviors for standardized evaluation of steering techniques. Building on insights from this benchmark, we introduce Instruction Attention Boosting (InstABoost), a latent steering method that boosts the strength of instruction prompting by altering the model's attention during generation. InstABoost combines the strengths of existing approaches and is theoretically supported by prior work that suggests that in-context rule following in transformer-based models can be controlled by manipulating attention on instructions. Empirically, InstABoost demonstrates superior control success compared to both traditional prompting and latent steering.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention due to their event-driven and low-power characteristics, making them particularly effective for processing event-based neuromorphic data. Recent studies have shown that directly trained SNNs suffer from severe overfitting issues due to the limited scale of neuromorphic datasets and the gradient mismatching problem, which fundamentally constrain their generalization performance. In this paper, we propose a temporal regularization training (TRT) method by introducing a time-dependent regularization mechanism to enforce stronger constraints on early timesteps. We compare the performance of TRT with other state-of-the-art methods performance on datasets including CIFAR10/100, ImageNet100, DVS-CIFAR10, and N-Caltech101. To validate the effectiveness of TRT, we conducted ablation studies and analyses including loss landscape visualization and learning curve analysis, demonstrating that TRT can effectively mitigate overfitting and flatten the training loss landscape, thereby enhancing generalizability. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical interpretation of TRT's temporal regularization mechanism based on the results of Fisher information analysis. We analyze the temporal information dynamics inside SNNs by tracking Fisher information during the TRT training process, revealing the Temporal Information Concentration (TIC) phenomenon, where Fisher information progressively concentrates in early timesteps. The time-decaying regularization mechanism implemented in TRT effectively guides the network to learn robust features in early timesteps with rich information, thereby leading to significant improvements in model generalization. Code is available at https://github.com/ZBX05/Temporal-Regularization-Training.

By leveraging hierarchical reinforcement learning to model the structured phases of dialogue and employ meta-learning to enhance adaptability across diverse user profiles, our approach enhances adaptability and efficiency, enabling the system to learn from limited data, transition fluidly between dialogue phases, and personalize responses to heterogeneous patient needs. We apply our framework to Motivational Interviews, aiming to foster behavior change, and demonstrate that the proposed dialogue manager outperforms a state-of-the-art LLM baseline in terms of reward, showing a potential benefit of conditioning LLMs to create open-ended dialogue systems with specific goals.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable understanding capabilities, but are found struggling to tackle multi-shot scenarios,e.g., video clips with varying camera angles or scene changes. This challenge can render failures such as instance identity forgetting and key frame negligence. In this work, we first attribute the challenge to the lack of multi-shot annotations among existing datasets and therefore we introduce a new dataset termed MultiClip-Bench, featuring dense descriptions and instruction-based question-answering pairs tailored for multi-shot scenarios. We empirically find that the training set significantly boosts the multi-shot performance, while the testing benchmark provides a reliable measure of the model capability in multi-shot scenarios. By further analyzing and discovering that current models only encode instance features in a discrete or lossy manner, at the risk of missing identity information, we then contribute a new model IPFormer-VideoLLM. Its key idea is the injection of instance-level features as instance prompts through an efficient attention-based connector. This allows for the aggregation of instance-specific information across scenes. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed dataset and model not only enhance the multi-scene video understanding significantly, but also offer distinct advantages across various video benchmarks.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong predictive performance on relational data; however, their confidence estimates often misalign with actual predictive correctness, posing significant limitations for deployment in safety-critical settings. While existing graph-aware calibration methods seek to mitigate this limitation, they primarily depend on coarse one-hop statistics, such as neighbor-predicted confidence, or latent node embeddings, thereby neglecting the fine-grained structural heterogeneity inherent in graph topology. In this work, we propose Wavelet-Aware Temperature Scaling (WATS), a post-hoc calibration framework that assigns node-specific temperatures based on tunable heat-kernel graph wavelet features. Specifically, WATS harnesses the scalability and topology sensitivity of graph wavelets to refine confidence estimates, all without necessitating model retraining or access to neighboring logits or predictions. Extensive evaluations across seven benchmark datasets with varying graph structures and two GNN backbones demonstrate that WATS achieves the lowest Expected Calibration Error (ECE) among all compared methods, outperforming both classical and graph-specific baselines by up to 42.3\% in ECE and reducing calibration variance by 17.24\% on average compared with graph-specific methods. Moreover, WATS remains computationally efficient, scaling well across graphs of diverse sizes and densities. Code will be released based on publication.

Abstract: High-resolution imaging is crucial for enhancing visual clarity and enabling precise computer-assisted guidance in minimally invasive surgery (MIS). Despite the increasing adoption of 4K endoscopic systems, there remains a significant gap in publicly available native 4K datasets tailored specifically for robotic-assisted MIS. We introduce SurgiSR4K, the first publicly accessible surgical imaging and video dataset captured at a native 4K resolution, representing realistic conditions of robotic-assisted procedures. SurgiSR4K comprises diverse visual scenarios including specular reflections, tool occlusions, bleeding, and soft tissue deformations, meticulously designed to reflect common challenges faced during laparoscopic and robotic surgeries. This dataset opens up possibilities for a broad range of computer vision tasks that might benefit from high resolution data, such as super resolution (SR), smoke removal, surgical instrument detection, 3D tissue reconstruction, monocular depth estimation, instance segmentation, novel view synthesis, and vision-language model (VLM) development. SurgiSR4K provides a robust foundation for advancing research in high-resolution surgical imaging and fosters the development of intelligent imaging technologies aimed at enhancing performance, safety, and usability in image-guided robotic surgeries.

Abstract: Understanding Earth's subsurface is critical for energy transition, natural hazard mitigation, and planetary science. Yet subsurface analysis remains fragmented, with separate models required for structural interpretation, stratigraphic analysis, geobody segmentation, and property modeling-each tightly coupled to specific data distributions and task formulations. We introduce the Geological Everything Model 3D (GEM), a unified generative architecture that reformulates all these tasks as prompt-conditioned inference along latent structural frameworks derived from subsurface imaging. This formulation moves beyond task-specific models by enabling a shared inference mechanism, where GEM propagates human-provided prompts-such as well logs, masks, or structural sketches-along inferred structural frameworks to produce geologically coherent outputs. Through this mechanism, GEM achieves zero-shot generalization across tasks with heterogeneous prompt types, without retraining for new tasks or data sources. This capability emerges from a two-stage training process that combines self-supervised representation learning on large-scale field seismic data with adversarial fine-tuning using mixed prompts and labels across diverse subsurface tasks. GEM demonstrates broad applicability across surveys and tasks, including Martian radar stratigraphy analysis, structural interpretation in subduction zones, full seismic stratigraphic interpretation, geobody segmentation, and property modeling. By bridging expert knowledge with generative reasoning in a structurally aware manner, GEM lays the foundation for scalable, human-in-the-loop geophysical AI-transitioning from fragmented pipelines to a vertically integrated, promptable reasoning system.

Summary: <br />
Large language models have shown impressive reasoning abilities in tasks like mathematics and coding, yet they lack true comprehension of their reasoning processes. This paper explores how self-play can enhance model rationality in reasoning without human supervision. The proposed Critic-Discernment Game involves a prover providing solutions to problems and facing critiques that assist or mislead. The prover must maintain the correct answer in the presence of misleading comments and correct errors based on constructive feedback. Experiments demonstrate that CDG training significantly improves the ability of well-aligned LLMs to comprehend their reasoning process. The tasks tested include mathematical reasoning, error detection, self-correction, and long-chain reasoning. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable reasoning abilities in various tasks such as mathematics and coding. However, recent studies indicate that even the best models lack true comprehension of their reasoning processes. In this paper, we explore how self-play can enhance the rationality of models in the reasoning process without supervision from humans or superior models. We design a Critic-Discernment Game(CDG) in which a prover first provides a solution to a given problem and is subsequently challenged by critiques of its solution. These critiques either aim to assist or mislead the prover. The objective of the prover is to maintain the correct answer when faced with misleading comments, while correcting errors in response to constructive feedback. Our experiments on tasks involving mathematical reasoning, stepwise error detection, self-correction, and long-chain reasoning demonstrate that CDG training can significantly improve the ability of well-aligned LLMs to comprehend their reasoning process.

Abstract: Deploying a Machine Learning (ML) training pipeline into production requires good software engineering practices. Unfortunately, the typical data science workflow often leads to code that lacks critical software quality attributes. This experience report investigates this problem in SPIRA, a project whose goal is to create an ML-Enabled System (MLES) to pre-diagnose insufficiency respiratory via speech analysis. This paper presents an overview of the architecture of the MLES, then compares three versions of its Continuous Training subsystem: from a proof of concept Big Ball of Mud (v1), to a design pattern-based Modular Monolith (v2), to a test-driven set of Microservices (v3) Each version improved its overall extensibility, maintainability, robustness, and resiliency. The paper shares challenges and lessons learned in this process, offering insights for researchers and practitioners seeking to productionize their pipelines.

<div> diffusion, language models, multimodal, attention, generation <br />
Summary:<br />
This article provides a systematic survey of Discrete Diffusion Language Models (dLLMs) and Discrete Diffusion Multimodal Language Models (dMLLMs), which differ from autoregressive models by using a multi-token, parallel decoding paradigm with full attention and a denoising-based generation strategy. This approach enables parallel generation, fine-grained output controllability, and dynamic, response-aware perception. The research in this domain has been driven by advancements in autoregressive models and the mathematical models underlying discrete diffusion. The article traces the historical development of dLLMs and dMLLMs, formalizes the mathematical frameworks, categorizes representative models, analyzes key techniques for training and inference, and summarizes emerging applications across language, vision-language, and biological domains. Future directions for research and deployment are discussed as well. <div>

Abstract: In this work, we provide a systematic survey of Discrete Diffusion Language Models (dLLMs) and Discrete Diffusion Multimodal Language Models (dMLLMs). Unlike autoregressive (AR) models, dLLMs and dMLLMs adopt a multi-token, parallel decoding paradigm using full attention and a denoising-based generation strategy. This paradigm naturally enables parallel generation, fine-grained output controllability, and dynamic, response-aware perception. These capabilities are previously difficult to achieve with AR models. Recently, a growing number of industrial-scale proprietary d(M)LLMs, as well as a large number of open-source academic d(M)LLMs, have demonstrated performance comparable to their autoregressive counterparts, while achieving up to 10x acceleration in inference speed.
  The advancement of discrete diffusion LLMs and MLLMs has been largely driven by progress in two domains. The first is the development of autoregressive LLMs and MLLMs, which has accumulated vast amounts of data, benchmarks, and foundational infrastructure for training and inference. The second contributing domain is the evolution of the mathematical models underlying discrete diffusion. Together, these advancements have catalyzed a surge in dLLMs and dMLLMs research in early 2025.
  In this work, we present a comprehensive overview of the research in the dLLM and dMLLM domains. We trace the historical development of dLLMs and dMLLMs, formalize the underlying mathematical frameworks, and categorize representative models. We further analyze key techniques for training and inference, and summarize emerging applications across language, vision-language, and biological domains. We conclude by discussing future directions for research and deployment.

Large language models hold potential in aiding medical decision-making, specifically in addressing the treatment problem faced by patients. This problem involves collaborating with healthcare providers to find the most suitable treatment option. Different approaches, such as trials and observational data within evidence-based medicine, are explored to solve this problem. Another aspect discussed is the chat problem, highlighting how it differs from the treatment problem concerning imitation.

Abstract: Large language models are thought to have potential to aid in medical decision making. We investigate this here. We start with the treatment problem, the patient's core medical decision-making task, which is solved in collaboration with a healthcare provider. We discuss approaches to solving the treatment problem, including -- within evidence-based medicine -- trials and observational data. We then discuss the chat problem, and how this differs from the treatment problem -- in particular as it relates to imitation. We then discuss how a large language model might be used to solve the treatment problem and highlight some of the challenges that emerge. We finally discuss how these challenges relate to evidence-based medicine, and how this might inform next steps.

<div> Keywords: multi-organ segmentation, cross-modal interaction, semantic prompting, medical imaging, deep learning

Summary:<br />
The article introduces CRISP-SAM2, a novel model for multi-organ medical segmentation that addresses key challenges in the field. The model utilizes a progressive cross-attention interaction mechanism to incorporate textual descriptions of organs into the segmentation process, enhancing detailed understanding of visual information. By employing a semantic prompting strategy and a similarity-sorting self-updating strategy for memory, CRISP-SAM2 reduces reliance on geometric prompts and improves localization of details. The model outperforms existing models on seven public datasets, demonstrating superior performance in accurate segmentation while retaining spatial information. The code for CRISP-SAM2 is available on GitHub, providing a valuable tool for medical image processing research. <div>

Abstract: Multi-organ medical segmentation is a crucial component of medical image processing, essential for doctors to make accurate diagnoses and develop effective treatment plans. Despite significant progress in this field, current multi-organ segmentation models often suffer from inaccurate details, dependence on geometric prompts and loss of spatial information. Addressing these challenges, we introduce a novel model named CRISP-SAM2 with CRoss-modal Interaction and Semantic Prompting based on SAM2. This model represents a promising approach to multi-organ medical segmentation guided by textual descriptions of organs. Our method begins by converting visual and textual inputs into cross-modal contextualized semantics using a progressive cross-attention interaction mechanism. These semantics are then injected into the image encoder to enhance the detailed understanding of visual information. To eliminate reliance on geometric prompts, we use a semantic prompting strategy, replacing the original prompt encoder to sharpen the perception of challenging targets. In addition, a similarity-sorting self-updating strategy for memory and a mask-refining process is applied to further adapt to medical imaging and enhance localized details. Comparative experiments conducted on seven public datasets indicate that CRISP-SAM2 outperforms existing models. Extensive analysis also demonstrates the effectiveness of our method, thereby confirming its superior performance, especially in addressing the limitations mentioned earlier. Our code is available at: https://github.com/YU-deep/CRISP_SAM2.git.

Summary:
In this work, a Refined Random Forest Classifier is proposed to address the issues of high inference cost and model redundancy associated with traditional Random Forest (RF) models. The refined classifier dynamically grows trees only on informative features and maximizes diversity by clustering and retaining uncorrelated trees. It iteratively refines itself by removing the least informative features and determining the optimal number of new trees to grow. Correlation-based clustering is then used to eliminate redundant trees. Experimental results on various datasets show that the proposed model outperforms standard RF in terms of classification accuracy. This refined approach to building random forests offers improved performance while reducing redundancy and inference cost. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.00467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random Forest (RF) is a widely used ensemble learning technique known for its robust classification performance across diverse domains. However, it often relies on hundreds of trees and all input features, leading to high inference cost and model redundancy. In this work, our goal is to grow trees dynamically only on informative features and then enforce maximal diversity by clustering and retaining uncorrelated trees. Therefore, we propose a Refined Random Forest Classifier that iteratively refines itself by first removing the least informative features and then analytically determines how many new trees should be grown, followed by correlation-based clustering to remove redundant trees. The classification accuracy of our model was compared against the standard RF on the same number of trees. Experiments on 8 multiple benchmark datasets, including binary and multiclass datasets, demonstrate that the proposed model achieves improved accuracy compared to standard RF.

<div> Keywords: object recognition, local texture cues, configural shape score, convolutional models, transformer models

Summary:
Humans recognize objects using both local texture cues and global part configurations, but current vision models focus mainly on local texture cues, leading to rigid features. The Configural Shape Score (CSS) measures the ability to recognize objects in different configurations while preserving local texture, with self-supervised transformers like DINOv2 and SigLIP2 performing well. High-CSS networks rely on long-range interactions and exhibit a transition from local to global coding. Border-hacking strategies are ruled out through control experiments with BagNet. The CSS also predicts other shape-dependent evaluations. The study suggests that the key to robust and human-like vision systems lies in seamlessly integrating both local texture and global configural shape cues in the architectural and learning frameworks. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.00493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans are able to recognize objects based on both local texture cues and the configuration of object parts, yet contemporary vision models primarily harvest local texture cues, yielding brittle, non-compositional features. Work on shape-vs-texture bias has pitted shape and texture representations in opposition, measuring shape relative to texture, ignoring the possibility that models (and humans) can simultaneously rely on both types of cues, and obscuring the absolute quality of both types of representation. We therefore recast shape evaluation as a matter of absolute configural competence, operationalized by the Configural Shape Score (CSS), which (i) measures the ability to recognize both images in Object-Anagram pairs that preserve local texture while permuting global part arrangement to depict different object categories. Across 86 convolutional, transformer, and hybrid models, CSS (ii) uncovers a broad spectrum of configural sensitivity with fully self-supervised and language-aligned transformers -- exemplified by DINOv2, SigLIP2 and EVA-CLIP -- occupying the top end of the CSS spectrum. Mechanistic probes reveal that (iii) high-CSS networks depend on long-range interactions: radius-controlled attention masks abolish performance showing a distinctive U-shaped integration profile, and representational-similarity analyses expose a mid-depth transition from local to global coding. A BagNet control remains at chance (iv), ruling out "border-hacking" strategies. Finally, (v) we show that configural shape score also predicts other shape-dependent evals. Overall, we propose that the path toward truly robust, generalizable, and human-like vision systems may not lie in forcing an artificial choice between shape and texture, but rather in architectural and learning frameworks that seamlessly integrate both local-texture and global configural shape.

Summary:  
Correctness is crucial in dynamic environments where autonomous AI agents delegate work to sub-agents. Traditional methods of assuring correctness through upfront specifications or central oversight are not effective. This article proposes a protocol that enforces correctness through collateralized claims in a recursive verification game. Tasks are published as intents, and solvers compete to fulfill them. The selected solvers carry out tasks under risk, with correctness verified post hoc by verifiers. Challengers can stake against incorrect results to trigger the verification process. Incorrect agents are penalized and correct opposition is rewarded, aligning incentives across solvers, challengers, and verifiers. Falsification conditions ensure that correctness is the Nash equilibrium in this protocol. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Correctness is an emergent property of systems where exposing error is cheaper than committing it. In dynamic, low-trust environments, autonomous AI agents benefit from delegating work to sub-agents, yet correctness cannot be assured through upfront specification or centralized oversight. We propose a protocol that enforces correctness through collateralized claims in a recursive verification game. Tasks are published as intents, and solvers compete to fulfill them. Selected solvers carry out tasks under risk, with correctness checked post hoc by verifiers. Any challenger can challenge a result by staking against it to trigger the verification process. Incorrect agents are slashed and correct opposition is rewarded, with an escalation path that penalizes erroneous verifiers themselves. When incentives are aligned across solvers, challengers, and verifiers, falsification conditions make correctness the Nash equilibrium.

The novel approach proposed in this research focuses on unified image restoration, a challenging task in low-level vision. Unlike existing methods that are designed for specific tasks or rely on paired datasets, this approach is dataset-free and unified, making it more generalizable. By utilizing a pretrained latent diffusion model, it incorporates a multimodal understanding model to provide sematic priors for the generative model. Additionally, a lightweight module is used to align the degraded input with the preferences of the diffusion model, and recurrent refinement for posterior sampling is employed.

Abstract: Unified image restoration is a significantly challenging task in low-level vision. Existing methods either make tailored designs for specific tasks, limiting their generalizability across various types of degradation, or rely on training with paired datasets, thereby suffering from closed-set constraints. To address these issues, we propose a novel, dataset-free, and unified approach through recurrent posterior sampling utilizing a pretrained latent diffusion model. Our method incorporates the multimodal understanding model to provide sematic priors for the generative model under a task-blind condition. Furthermore, it utilizes a lightweight module to align the degraded input with the generated preference of the diffusion model, and employs recurrent refinement for posterior sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness and robustness.

<div> Robotics, Imitation Learning, AI-generated Videos, Complex Manipulation Tasks, 6D Pose Tracking
<br />
Summary:<br />
Robots Imitating Generated Videos (RIGVid) is a system that enables robots to perform complex manipulation tasks by imitating AI-generated videos, without physical demonstrations or robot-specific training. The system utilizes a video diffusion model to generate demonstration videos based on a language command and an initial scene image. A vision-language model filters out videos that do not follow the command, and a 6D pose tracker extracts object trajectories from the videos. These trajectories are then retargeted to the robot in an embodiment-agnostic manner. Real-world evaluations demonstrate that generated videos are as effective as real demonstrations and that performance improves with generation quality. Using generated videos outperforms other methods such as keypoint prediction with VLMs, and strong 6D pose tracking is found to be the most effective way to extract trajectories for robotic manipulation tasks. The study suggests that state-of-the-art AI-generated videos can provide effective supervision for robots.

Abstract: This work introduces Robots Imitating Generated Videos (RIGVid), a system that enables robots to perform complex manipulation tasks--such as pouring, wiping, and mixing--purely by imitating AI-generated videos, without requiring any physical demonstrations or robot-specific training. Given a language command and an initial scene image, a video diffusion model generates potential demonstration videos, and a vision-language model (VLM) automatically filters out results that do not follow the command. A 6D pose tracker then extracts object trajectories from the video, and the trajectories are retargeted to the robot in an embodiment-agnostic fashion. Through extensive real-world evaluations, we show that filtered generated videos are as effective as real demonstrations, and that performance improves with generation quality. We also show that relying on generated videos outperforms more compact alternatives such as keypoint prediction using VLMs, and that strong 6D pose tracking outperforms other ways to extract trajectories, such as dense feature point tracking. These findings suggest that videos produced by a state-of-the-art off-the-shelf model can offer an effective source of supervision for robotic manipulation.

<div> Keywords: System Instructions, Large Language Models, SI-Agent, automated generation, human-readable

Summary:
SI-Agent is a new framework designed to automatically generate and improve human-readable System Instructions for Large Language Models (LLMs). It consists of three agents working together: an Instructor Agent, an Instruction Follower Agent (LLM), and a Feedback/Reward Agent. Through iterative cycles guided by feedback, the Instructor Agent refines the instructions to improve task performance and readability. Experimental results show that SI-Agent effectively generates readable SIs, striking a balance between performance and interpretability compared to existing methods. This framework has the potential to democratize LLM customization and enhance model transparency. However, challenges such as computational cost and feedback reliability need to be considered. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.03223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: System Instructions (SIs), or system prompts, are pivotal for guiding Large Language Models (LLMs) but manual crafting is resource-intensive and often suboptimal. Existing automated methods frequently generate non-human-readable "soft prompts," sacrificing interpretability. This paper introduces SI-Agent, a novel agentic framework designed to automatically generate and iteratively refine human-readable SIs through a feedback-driven loop. SI-Agent employs three collaborating agents: an Instructor Agent, an Instruction Follower Agent (target LLM), and a Feedback/Reward Agent evaluating task performance and optionally SI readability. The framework utilizes iterative cycles where feedback guides the Instructor's refinement strategy (e.g., LLM-based editing, evolutionary algorithms). We detail the framework's architecture, agent roles, the iterative refinement process, and contrast it with existing methods. We present experimental results validating SI-Agent's effectiveness, focusing on metrics for task performance, SI readability, and efficiency. Our findings indicate that SI-Agent generates effective, readable SIs, offering a favorable trade-off between performance and interpretability compared to baselines. Potential implications include democratizing LLM customization and enhancing model transparency. Challenges related to computational cost and feedback reliability are acknowledged.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.03226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scalable and cost-efficient framework for deploying Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) in enterprise environments. While GraphRAG has shown promise for multi-hop reasoning and structured retrieval, its adoption has been limited by the high computational cost of constructing knowledge graphs using large language models (LLMs) and the latency of graph-based retrieval. To address these challenges, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a dependency-based knowledge graph construction pipeline that leverages industrial-grade NLP libraries to extract entities and relations from unstructured text completely eliminating reliance on LLMs; and (2) a lightweight graph retrieval strategy that combines hybrid query node identification with efficient one-hop traversal for high-recall, low-latency subgraph extraction. We evaluate our framework on two SAP datasets focused on legacy code migration and demonstrate strong empirical performance. Our system achieves up to 15% and 4.35% improvements over traditional RAG baselines based on LLM-as-Judge and RAGAS metrics, respectively. Moreover, our dependency-based construction approach attains 94% of the performance of LLM-generated knowledge graphs (61.87% vs. 65.83%) while significantly reducing cost and improving scalability. These results validate the feasibility of deploying GraphRAG systems in real-world, large-scale enterprise applications without incurring prohibitive resource requirements paving the way for practical, explainable, and domain-adaptable retrieval-augmented reasoning.

Abstract: Effective prompt design is essential for improving the planning capabilities of large language model (LLM)-driven agents. However, existing structured prompting strategies are typically limited to single-agent, plan-only settings, and often evaluate performance solely based on task accuracy - overlooking critical factors such as token efficiency, modularity, and scalability in multi-agent environments. To address these limitations, we introduce CodeAgents, a prompting framework that codifies multi-agent reasoning and enables structured, token-efficient planning in multi-agent systems. In CodeAgents, all components of agent interaction - Task, Plan, Feedback, system roles, and external tool invocations - are codified into modular pseudocode enriched with control structures (e.g., loops, conditionals), boolean logic, and typed variables. This design transforms loosely connected agent plans into cohesive, interpretable, and verifiable multi-agent reasoning programs. We evaluate the proposed framework across three diverse benchmarks - GAIA, HotpotQA, and VirtualHome - using a range of representative LLMs. Results show consistent improvements in planning performance, with absolute gains of 3-36 percentage points over natural language prompting baselines. On VirtualHome, our method achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 56%. In addition, our approach reduces input and output token usage by 55-87% and 41-70%, respectively, underscoring the importance of token-aware evaluation metrics in the development of scalable multi-agent LLM systems.

<div> Keywords: DyTAGs, Generative DyTAG Benchmark (GDGB), Transductive Dynamic Graph Generation (TDGG), Inductive Dynamic Graph Generation (IDGG), LLM-based multi-agent generative framework

Summary:
The article introduces the concept of Dynamic Text-Attributed Graphs (DyTAGs) and highlights the importance of integrating structural, temporal, and textual attributes for modeling complex real-world systems. It addresses the limitations of existing DyTAG datasets by proposing the Generative DyTAG Benchmark (GDGB), which includes eight high-quality DyTAG datasets with rich textual features. Two novel DyTAG generation tasks, Transductive Dynamic Graph Generation (TDGG) and Inductive Dynamic Graph Generation (IDGG), are defined to generate target DyTAGs based on specific criteria. Multifaceted metrics are designed to evaluate the quality of the generated DyTAGs, considering structural, temporal, and textual aspects. The article also introduces the GAG-General framework, an LLM-based multi-agent generative framework for benchmarking DyTAG generation. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of GDGB in advancing generative DyTAG research and unlocking practical applications in DyTAG generation. The datasets, source codes, and leaderboards for GDGB are made available for further exploration and research.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.03267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic Text-Attributed Graphs (DyTAGs), which intricately integrate structural, temporal, and textual attributes, are crucial for modeling complex real-world systems. However, most of the existing DyTAG datasets exhibit poor textual quality, which severely limits their utility for DyTAG generation tasks requiring semantically rich inputs. Additionally, prior work mainly focuses on discriminative tasks on DyTAGs, resulting in a lack of standardized task formulations and evaluation protocols tailored for DyTAG generation. To address these critical issues, we propose Generative DyTAG Benchmark (GDGB), which comprises eight meticulously curated DyTAG datasets with high-quality textual features for both nodes and edges, overcoming limitations of prior datasets. Building on GDGB, we define two novel DyTAG generation tasks: Transductive Dynamic Graph Generation (TDGG) and Inductive Dynamic Graph Generation (IDGG). TDGG transductively generates a target DyTAG based on the given source and destination node sets, while the more challenging IDGG introduces new node generation to inductively model the dynamic expansion of real-world graph data. To enable holistic evaluation, we design multifaceted metrics that assess the structural, temporal, and textual quality of the generated DyTAGs. We further propose GAG-General, an LLM-based multi-agent generative framework tailored for reproducible and robust benchmarking of DyTAG generation. Experimental results demonstrate that GDGB enables rigorous evaluation of TDGG and IDGG, with key insights revealing the critical interplay of structural and textual features in DyTAG generation. These findings establish GDGB as a foundational resource for advancing generative DyTAG research and unlocking further practical applications in DyTAG generation. GDGB datasets, source codes, and leaderboards are available at \href{https://gdgb-algo.github.io/}{here}.

<div> Memory Mosaics, associative memories networks, scaled to llama-8B size, trained on one trillion tokens, with architectural modifications ("Memory Mosaics v2"), evaluated on training-knowledge storage, new-knowledge storage, and in-context learning. Keywords: Memory Mosaics, associative memories, large language models, training-knowledge storage, in-context learning

Summary:
Memory Mosaics v2, scaled to 10B size, outperform transformers on new-knowledge storage and in-context learning. They match transformers on training-knowledge storage. Architectural modifications enhance performance. Memory Mosaics v2 trained on one trillion tokens outperform transformers trained on eight trillion tokens. These improvements are not solely due to increased training data. Memory Mosaics exhibit strengths in carrying out new tasks at inference time, highlighting their potential for real-world applications. <div>
arXiv:2507.03285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memory Mosaics [Zhang et al., 2025], networks of associative memories, have demonstrated appealing compositional and in-context learning capabilities on medium-scale networks (GPT-2 scale) and synthetic small datasets. This work shows that these favorable properties remain when we scale memory mosaics to large language model sizes (llama-8B scale) and real-world datasets.
  To this end, we scale memory mosaics to 10B size, we train them on one trillion tokens, we introduce a couple architectural modifications ("Memory Mosaics v2"), we assess their capabilities across three evaluation dimensions: training-knowledge storage, new-knowledge storage, and in-context learning.
  Throughout the evaluation, memory mosaics v2 match transformers on the learning of training knowledge (first dimension) and significantly outperforms transformers on carrying out new tasks at inference time (second and third dimensions). These improvements cannot be easily replicated by simply increasing the training data for transformers. A memory mosaics v2 trained on one trillion tokens still perform better on these tasks than a transformer trained on eight trillion tokens.

<div> large language models, modular architecture, actor-critic, linear temporal logic, Minecraft

Summary:
The article introduces a modular actor-critic architecture for enhancing the decision-making capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in long-term planning tasks. The proposed architecture combines an LLM actor with LTLCrit, a trajectory-level LLM critic that communicates through linear temporal logic (LTL). The actor makes high-level action selections based on natural language input, while the critic analyzes full trajectories and suggests new LTL constraints to prevent unsafe or inefficient behavior in the future. This setup supports both fixed safety constraints and adaptive soft constraints for promoting long-term efficiency. The system is model-agnostic, allowing different LLM-based planners to serve as the actor. Formalizing planning as graph traversal under symbolic constraints enables the critic to generate new logic rules based on analyzing failed or suboptimal trajectories. Evaluation on the Minecraft diamond-mining benchmark shows improved efficiency and 100% completion rates compared to baseline LLM planners. The results demonstrate the potential of using logic to enable LLMs to supervise each other for safe and generalizable decision-making.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.03293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in reasoning tasks and general decision-making in static environments. In long-term planning tasks, however, errors tend to accumulate, often leading to unsafe or inefficient behavior, limiting their use in general-purpose settings. We propose a modular actor-critic architecture in which an LLM actor is guided by LTLCrit, a trajectory-level LLM critic that communicates via linear temporal logic (LTL). Our setup combines the reasoning strengths of language models with the guarantees of formal logic. The actor selects high-level actions from natural language observations, while the critic analyzes full trajectories and proposes new LTL constraints that shield the actor from future unsafe or inefficient behavior. The architecture supports both fixed, hand-specified safety constraints and adaptive, learned soft constraints that promote long-term efficiency. Our architecture is model-agnostic: any LLM-based planner can serve as the actor, and LTLCrit serves as a logic-generating wrapper. We formalize planning as graph traversal under symbolic constraints, allowing LTLCrit to analyze failed or suboptimal trajectories and generate new temporal logic rules that improve future behavior. We evaluate our system on the Minecraft diamond-mining benchmark, achieving 100% completion rates and improving efficiency compared to baseline LLM planners. Our results suggest that enabling LLMs to supervise each other through logic is a powerful and flexible paradigm for safe, generalizable decision making.

Abstract: We present NDAI-NeuroMAP, the first neuroscience-domain-specific dense vector embedding model engineered for high-precision information retrieval tasks. Our methodology encompasses the curation of an extensive domain-specific training corpus comprising 500,000 carefully constructed triplets (query-positive-negative configurations), augmented with 250,000 neuroscience-specific definitional entries and 250,000 structured knowledge-graph triplets derived from authoritative neurological ontologies. We employ a sophisticated fine-tuning approach utilizing the FremyCompany/BioLORD-2023 foundation model, implementing a multi-objective optimization framework combining contrastive learning with triplet-based metric learning paradigms. Comprehensive evaluation on a held-out test dataset comprising approximately 24,000 neuroscience-specific queries demonstrates substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art general-purpose and biomedical embedding models. These empirical findings underscore the critical importance of domain-specific embedding architectures for neuroscience-oriented RAG systems and related clinical natural language processing applications.

Summary: 
In the paper, the authors introduce OSCAR, a technical pipeline designed to enhance the cooking experience for individuals with vision impairments by leveraging object status recognition. By integrating aspects such as recipe parsing, object status extraction, visual alignment with cooking steps, and time-causal modeling, OSCAR facilitates real-time tracking of recipe progress. The study evaluated OSCAR using instructional videos and real-world data from non-visual cooking sessions, demonstrating improved step prediction accuracy with the inclusion of object status information. The analysis also highlighted factors influencing performance in practical settings, including implicit tasks, camera placement, and lighting conditions. The research contributes a context-aware recipe progress tracking pipeline, an annotated non-visual cooking dataset, and valuable design insights for the development of assistive cooking systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.03330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooking plays a vital role in everyday independence and well-being, yet remains challenging for people with vision impairments due to limited support for tracking progress and receiving contextual feedback. Object status - the condition or transformation of ingredients and tools - offers a promising but underexplored foundation for context-aware cooking support. In this paper, we present OSCAR (Object Status Context Awareness for Recipes), a technical pipeline that explores the use of object status recognition to enable recipe progress tracking in non-visual cooking. OSCAR integrates recipe parsing, object status extraction, visual alignment with cooking steps, and time-causal modeling to support real-time step tracking. We evaluate OSCAR on 173 instructional videos and a real-world dataset of 12 non-visual cooking sessions recorded by BLV individuals in their homes. Our results show that object status consistently improves step prediction accuracy across vision-language models, and reveal key factors that impact performance in real-world conditions, such as implicit tasks, camera placement, and lighting. We contribute the pipeline of context-aware recipe progress tracking, an annotated real-world non-visual cooking dataset, and design insights to guide future context-aware assistive cooking systems.

Summary:<br />
- DiaFORGE is a three-stage pipeline designed to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) when interacting with enterprise APIs.
- The pipeline focuses on disambiguation in multi-turn dialogues, supervised fine-tuning of models, and live evaluation of model readiness.
- Models trained with DiaFORGE outperform existing models by significantly improving tool-invocation success rates.
- DiaBENCH, a dynamic benchmark, is introduced to evaluate the real-world performance of models in an agentic loop.
- An open corpus of 5000 enterprise API specifications and dialogues is released to facilitate further research and the development of reliable tool-calling agents.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.03336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with invoking enterprise APIs, yet they routinely falter when near-duplicate tools vie for the same user intent or when required arguments are left underspecified. We introduce DiaFORGE (Dialogue Framework for Organic Response Generation & Evaluation), a disambiguation-centric, three-stage pipeline that (i) synthesizes persona-driven, multi-turn dialogues in which the assistant must distinguish among highly similar tools, (ii) performs supervised fine-tuning of open-source models with reasoning traces across 3B - 70B parameters, and (iii) evaluates real-world readiness via a dynamic suite that redeploys each model in a live agentic loop and reports end-to-end goal completion alongside conventional static metrics. On our dynamic benchmark DiaBENCH, models trained with DiaFORGE raise tool-invocation success by 27 pp over GPT-4o and by 49 pp over Claude-3.5-Sonnet, both under optimized prompting. To spur further research, we release an open corpus of 5000 production-grade enterprise API specifications paired with rigorously validated, disambiguation-focused dialogues, offering a practical blueprint for building reliable, enterprise-ready tool-calling agents.

Summary: <br />
The study evaluates structured and unstructured reasoning models for compound systems. iSelf-Discover, an instance-level adaptation of the Self-Discover framework, is introduced to compare structured JSON reasoning with unstructured reasoning. Results across benchmarks show a consistent advantage for unstructured reasoning, with up to an 18.90% relative performance improvement on the MATH benchmark. Zero-shot unstructured variants outperform structured counterparts, highlighting the gap even with dynamically generated structured plans. The optimal granularity of plan generation is context-dependent. These findings question the reliance on structured formats for complex problem-solving and offer insights into organizing compound systems. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.03347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The drive for predictable LLM reasoning in their integration with compound systems has popularized structured outputs, yet concerns remain about performance trade-offs compared to unconstrained natural language. At the same time, training on unconstrained Chain of Thought (CoT) traces has brought about a new class of strong reasoning models that nevertheless present novel compute budget and faithfulness challenges. This paper introduces iSelf-Discover, an instance-level adaptation of the Self-Discover framework, and using it compares dynamically generated structured JSON reasoning with its unstructured counterpart. Our empirical evaluation across diverse benchmarks using state-of-the-art open-source models supports a consistent advantage for unstructured reasoning. Notably, on the complex MATH benchmark, unstructured plans achieved relative performance improvements of up to 18.90\% over structured approaches. Zero-shot unstructured iSelf-Discover variants are also shown to outperform their five-shot structured counterparts, underscoring the significance of this gap, even when structured plans are dynamically generated to ensure reasoning precedes the final answer. We further demonstrate that the optimal granularity of plan generation (instance-level vs. task-level) is context-dependent. These findings invite re-evaluation of the reliance on structured formats for complex problem-solving and how compound systems should be organized.

Abstract: This paper systematically reviews recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), with a particular focus on machine learning (ML), across the entire drug discovery pipeline. Due to the inherent complexity, escalating costs, prolonged timelines, and high failure rates of traditional drug discovery methods, there is a critical need to comprehensively understand how AI/ML can be effectively integrated throughout the full process. Currently available literature reviews often narrowly focus on specific phases or methodologies, neglecting the dependence between key stages such as target identification, hit screening, and lead optimization. To bridge this gap, our review provides a detailed and holistic analysis of AI/ML applications across these core phases, highlighting significant methodological advances and their impacts at each stage. We further illustrate the practical impact of these techniques through an in-depth case study focused on hyperuricemia, gout arthritis, and hyperuricemic nephropathy, highlighting real-world successes in molecular target identification and therapeutic candidate discovery. Additionally, we discuss significant challenges facing AI/ML in drug discovery and outline promising future research directions. Ultimately, this review serves as an essential orientation for researchers aiming to leverage AI/ML to overcome existing bottlenecks and accelerate drug discovery.

Summary: The article examines the possibility of current AI systems developing a capacity for scheming, similar to the historical research in the 1970s on non-human primates mastering natural language. Lessons from the past research highlight the overattribution of human traits, reliance on anecdotal evidence, and lack of a strong theoretical framework. The recommendation for AI scheming research is to avoid these pitfalls, outlining concrete steps for a productive and scientifically rigorous approach. The comparison between the past and current research practices emphasizes the importance of avoiding anthropomorphism and anecdotal analysis while establishing a solid theoretical foundation for exploring AI's potential for strategic misalignment. <div>

Abstract: We examine recent research that asks whether current AI systems may be developing a capacity for "scheming" (covertly and strategically pursuing misaligned goals). We compare current research practices in this field to those adopted in the 1970s to test whether non-human primates could master natural language. We argue that there are lessons to be learned from that historical research endeavour, which was characterised by an overattribution of human traits to other agents, an excessive reliance on anecdote and descriptive analysis, and a failure to articulate a strong theoretical framework for the research. We recommend that research into AI scheming actively seeks to avoid these pitfalls. We outline some concrete steps that can be taken for this research programme to advance in a productive and scientifically rigorous fashion.

Summary:
The study introduces a Multi-agent Exploratory Synergy for the Heart (MESHAgents) framework that utilizes large language models as agents to identify associations between imaging phenotypes and disease risk factors. The framework involves a multi-disciplinary team of AI agents spanning various fields like cardiology and statistics to analyze complex dependencies among imaging phenotypes and other data. Through iterative reasoning, the framework autonomously uncovers correlations between imaging phenotypes and non-imaging factors, going beyond standard demographic variables. Validation on diagnosis tasks shows that MESHAgents-discovered phenotypes perform comparably to expert-selected ones. The framework offers clinically relevant imaging phenotypes with transparent reasoning, providing a scalable alternative to traditional expert-driven methods. Overall, the system enhances understanding of disease mechanisms and improves diagnosis and prognosis models.

Abstract: Identifying the associations between imaging phenotypes and disease risk factors and outcomes is essential for understanding disease mechanisms and improving diagnosis and prognosis models. However, traditional approaches rely on human-driven hypothesis testing and selection of association factors, often overlooking complex, non-linear dependencies among imaging phenotypes and other multi-modal data. To address this, we introduce a Multi-agent Exploratory Synergy for the Heart (MESHAgents) framework that leverages large language models as agents to dynamically elicit, surface, and decide confounders and phenotypes in association studies, using cardiovascular imaging as a proof of concept. Specifically, we orchestrate a multi-disciplinary team of AI agents -- spanning cardiology, biomechanics, statistics, and clinical research -- which spontaneously generate and converge on insights through iterative, self-organizing reasoning. The framework dynamically synthesizes statistical correlations with multi-expert consensus, providing an automated pipeline for phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). We demonstrate the system's capabilities through a population-based study of imaging phenotypes of the heart and aorta. MESHAgents autonomously uncovered correlations between imaging phenotypes and a wide range of non-imaging factors, identifying additional confounder variables beyond standard demographic factors. Validation on diagnosis tasks reveals that MESHAgents-discovered phenotypes achieve performance comparable to expert-selected phenotypes, with mean AUC differences as small as -0.004 on disease classification tasks. Notably, the recall score improves for 6 out of 9 disease types. Our framework provides clinically relevant imaging phenotypes with transparent reasoning, offering a scalable alternative to expert-driven methods.

<div> Keywords: AI supervision, control, oversight, risk management, maturity model

Summary: 
This paper examines the differentiation between oversight and control in the context of AI systems. Control is seen as ex-ante or real-time operational measures aimed at preventing failures, while oversight focuses on detection, remediation, and incentives for future prevention. The paper proposes a framework that articulates the conditions for each mechanism, their shortcomings, and the necessary elements for practical implementation. It suggests documenting supervision methods and integrating them into risk management processes, offering a maturity model for AI supervision based on the Microsoft Responsible AI Maturity Model. The paper also delves into the boundaries of these mechanisms, highlighting where they apply, fail, and where new methods are needed. It raises questions about the feasibility of meaningful supervision in different deployment contexts, aiding regulators, auditors, and practitioners in identifying limitations and the need for advancements in both conceptual and technical aspects. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.03525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oversight and control (collectively, supervision) are often invoked as key levers for ensuring that AI systems are accountable, reliable, and able to fulfill governance and management requirements. However, the concepts are frequently conflated or insufficiently distinguished in academic and policy discourse, undermining efforts to design or evaluate systems that should remain under meaningful human supervision.
  This paper undertakes a targeted critical review of literature on supervision outside of AI, along with a brief summary of past work on the topic related to AI. We then differentiate control as being ex-ante or real-time, and operational rather than policy or governance. In contrast, oversight is either a policy and governance function, or is ex-post. We suggest that control aims to prevent failures. In contrast, oversight often focuses on detection, remediation, or incentives for future prevention; all preventative oversight strategies nonetheless necessitate control.
  Building on this foundation, we make three contributions. First, we propose a theoretically-informed yet policy-grounded framework that articulates the conditions under which each mechanism is possible, where they fall short, and what is required to make them meaningful in practice. Second, we outline how supervision methods should be documented and integrated into risk management, and drawing on the Microsoft Responsible AI Maturity Model, we outline a maturity model for AI supervision. Third, we explicitly highlight some boundaries of these mechanisms, including where they apply, where they fail, and where it is clear that no existing methods suffice. This foregrounds the question of whether meaningful supervision is possible in a given deployment context, and can support regulators, auditors, and practitioners in identifying both present limitations and the need for new conceptual and technical advances.

Summary:<br />
This paper addresses the challenge of representing and solving assignment problems with infinite state and action spaces using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). The proposed method includes a graph-based feature representation called an assignment graph, a mapping from Colored Petri Nets to assignment graphs, and an adapted Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm. By modeling three different assignment problems with varying dimensionalities, the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in learning near-optimal task assignment policies regardless of the state and action space dimensionalities. <div>

Abstract: Dynamic task assignment concerns the optimal assignment of resources to tasks in a business process. Recently, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been proposed as the state of the art for solving assignment problems. DRL methods usually employ a neural network (NN) as an approximator for the policy function, which ingests the state of the process and outputs a valuation of the possible assignments. However, representing the state and the possible assignments so that they can serve as inputs and outputs for a policy NN remains an open challenge, especially when tasks or resources have features with an infinite number of possible values. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a method for representing and solving assignment problems with infinite state and action spaces. In doing so, it provides three contributions: (I) A graph-based feature representation of assignment problems, which we call assignment graph; (II) A mapping from marked Colored Petri Nets to assignment graphs; (III) An adaptation of the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm that can learn to solve assignment problems represented through assignment graphs. To evaluate the proposed representation method, we model three archetypal assignment problems ranging from finite to infinite state and action space dimensionalities. The experiments show that the method is suitable for representing and learning close-to-optimal task assignment policies regardless of the state and action space dimensionalities.

<div> Generative AI, ORAN architecture, Large Language Models, RAN Intelligent Controller, Retrieval-Augmented Generation<br />
Summary:<br />
Generative AI (GenAI) has the potential to revolutionize autonomous optimization in wireless networks, particularly in the ORAN architecture. Large Language Models (LLMs) can be specialized to generate xApps and rApps using specifications from the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC). Fine-tuning LLMs for telecom tasks is resource-intensive, but Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a practical alternative through in-context learning. This study evaluates Vector RAG, GraphRAG, and Hybrid GraphRAG using ORAN specifications, focusing on performance metrics such as faithfulness, answer relevance, context relevance, and factual correctness. Results indicate that both GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG outperform traditional RAG methods, with Hybrid GraphRAG showing an 8% improvement in factual correctness and GraphRAG improving context relevance by 7%. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is expected to play a pivotal role in enabling autonomous optimization in future wireless networks. Within the ORAN architecture, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be specialized to generate xApps and rApps by leveraging specifications and API definitions from the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) platform. However, fine-tuning base LLMs for telecom-specific tasks remains expensive and resource-intensive. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a practical alternative through in-context learning, enabling domain adaptation without full retraining. While traditional RAG systems rely on vector-based retrieval, emerging variants such as GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG incorporate knowledge graphs or dual retrieval strategies to support multi-hop reasoning and improve factual grounding. Despite their promise, these methods lack systematic, metric-driven evaluations, particularly in high-stakes domains such as ORAN. In this study, we conduct a comparative evaluation of Vector RAG, GraphRAG, and Hybrid GraphRAG using ORAN specifications. We assess performance across varying question complexities using established generation metrics: faithfulness, answer relevance, context relevance, and factual correctness. Results show that both GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG outperform traditional RAG. Hybrid GraphRAG improves factual correctness by 8%, while GraphRAG improves context relevance by 7%.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for orchestrating large language models (LLMs) and specialized tools to collaboratively address complex tasks. However, existing MAS frameworks often require manual workflow configuration and lack native support for dynamic evolution and performance optimization. In addition, many MAS optimization algorithms are not integrated into a unified framework. In this paper, we present EvoAgentX, an open-source platform that automates the generation, execution, and evolutionary optimization of multi-agent workflows. EvoAgentX employs a modular architecture consisting of five core layers: the basic components, agent, workflow, evolving, and evaluation layers. Specifically, within the evolving layer, EvoAgentX integrates three MAS optimization algorithms, TextGrad, AFlow, and MIPRO, to iteratively refine agent prompts, tool configurations, and workflow topologies. We evaluate EvoAgentX on HotPotQA, MBPP, and MATH for multi-hop reasoning, code generation, and mathematical problem solving, respectively, and further assess it on real-world tasks using GAIA. Experimental results show that EvoAgentX consistently achieves significant performance improvements, including a 7.44% increase in HotPotQA F1, a 10.00% improvement in MBPP pass@1, a 10.00% gain in MATH solve accuracy, and an overall accuracy improvement of up to 20.00% on GAIA.

<div> approach, machine Theory of Mind, large language models, Bayesian inverse planning models, generative agents
Summary: 
The article proposes a hybrid approach to machine Theory of Mind (ToM) by combining large language models and Bayesian inverse planning models. This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both components to improve performance on ToM tasks, even with smaller LLMs that typically struggle with such tasks. By using LLMs to generate hypotheses and likelihood functions and Bayesian inverse planning models to compute posterior probabilities for an agent's mental states, the approach closely matches optimal results on ToM tasks and shows potential for predicting mental states on open-ended tasks. This hybrid model offers a promising direction for the development of socially intelligent generative agents. <div>

Abstract: We propose a hybrid approach to machine Theory of Mind (ToM) that uses large language models (LLMs) as a mechanism for generating hypotheses and likelihood functions with a Bayesian inverse planning model that computes posterior probabilities for an agent's likely mental states given its actions. Bayesian inverse planning models can accurately predict human reasoning on a variety of ToM tasks, but these models are constrained in their ability to scale these predictions to scenarios with a large number of possible hypotheses and actions. Conversely, LLM-based approaches have recently demonstrated promise in solving ToM benchmarks, but can exhibit brittleness and failures on reasoning tasks even when they pass otherwise structurally identical versions. By combining these two methods, this approach leverages the strengths of each component, closely matching optimal results on a task inspired by prior inverse planning models and improving performance relative to models that utilize LLMs alone or with chain-of-thought prompting, even with smaller LLMs that typically perform poorly on ToM tasks. We also exhibit the model's potential to predict mental states on open-ended tasks, offering a promising direction for future development of ToM models and the creation of socially intelligent generative agents.

<div> Keywords: Knowledge Graph, Neural Networks, Symbolic Reasoning, Neurosymbolic Reasoning, Reasoning Scenarios

Summary: 
Tunsr is a unified neurosymbolic reasoning framework proposed for Knowledge Graph (KG) reasoning. It addresses the limitations of current methods by integrating neural and symbolic reasoning approaches and catering to diverse reasoning scenarios. Tunsr introduces a consistent reasoning graph structure and uses a forward logic message-passing mechanism to update representations and attentions of nodes. It merges multiple rules and induces first-order logic (FOL) rules using the FARI algorithm. Experimental results on 19 datasets across four reasoning scenarios show the effectiveness of Tunsr in transductive, inductive, interpolation, and extrapolation tasks. The framework successfully merges neural and symbolic methods, overcomes representation gaps, and handles different knowledge structures and reasoning objectives efficiently. Tunsr provides a promising solution for enhancing KG reasoning and improving downstream applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.03697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge Graph (KG) reasoning has received significant attention in the fields of artificial intelligence and knowledge engineering, owing to its ability to autonomously deduce new knowledge and consequently enhance the availability and precision of downstream applications. However, current methods predominantly concentrate on a single form of neural or symbolic reasoning, failing to effectively integrate the inherent strengths of both approaches. Furthermore, the current prevalent methods primarily focus on addressing a single reasoning scenario, presenting limitations in meeting the diverse demands of real-world reasoning tasks. Unifying the neural and symbolic methods, as well as diverse reasoning scenarios in one model is challenging as there is a natural representation gap between symbolic rules and neural networks, and diverse scenarios exhibit distinct knowledge structures and specific reasoning objectives. To address these issues, we propose a unified neurosymbolic reasoning framework, namely Tunsr, for KG reasoning. Tunsr first introduces a consistent structure of reasoning graph that starts from the query entity and constantly expands subsequent nodes by iteratively searching posterior neighbors. Based on it, a forward logic message-passing mechanism is proposed to update both the propositional representations and attentions, as well as first-order logic (FOL) representations and attentions of each node. In this way, Tunsr conducts the transformation of merging multiple rules by merging possible relations at each step. Finally, the FARI algorithm is proposed to induce FOL rules by constantly performing attention calculations over the reasoning graph. Extensive experimental results on 19 datasets of four reasoning scenarios (transductive, inductive, interpolation, and extrapolation) demonstrate the effectiveness of Tunsr.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful artificial intelligence (AI) tools transforming how research is conducted. However, their use in research has been met with skepticism, due to concerns about hallucinations, biases and potential harms to research. These emphasize the importance of clearly understanding the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs to ensure their effective and responsible use. Here, we present a roadmap for integrating LLMs into cross-disciplinary research, where effective communication, knowledge transfer and collaboration across diverse fields are essential but often challenging. We examine the capabilities and limitations of LLMs and provide a detailed computational biology case study (on modeling HIV rebound dynamics) demonstrating how iterative interactions with an LLM (ChatGPT) can facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration and research. We argue that LLMs are best used as augmentative tools within a human-in-the-loop framework. Looking forward, we envisage that the responsible use of LLMs will enhance innovative cross-disciplinary research and substantially accelerate scientific discoveries.

Summary: <br />
The paper explores enhancing LLM-based question-answering systems through agent-based architecture to address incompleteness and ambiguity in questions. By implementing zero-shot ReAct agents, the models can classify, resolve, or answer questions, leading to improved answer quality and explainable resolutions. Results show shortened interactions with humans, enhanced answer quality, and clear resolution of question deficiencies. While there may be increased latency and additional LLM invocations, the benefits outweigh the costs except for questions with sufficient context. This suggests that agent-based approaches can leverage LLMs to develop more reliable QA systems. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.03726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many of us now treat LLMs as modern-day oracles asking it almost any kind of question. However, consulting an LLM does not have to be a single turn activity. But long multi-turn interactions can get tedious if it is simply to clarify contextual information that can be arrived at through reasoning. In this paper, we examine the use of agent-based architecture to bolster LLM-based Question-Answering systems with additional reasoning capabilities. We examine the automatic resolution of potential incompleteness or ambiguities in questions by transducers implemented using LLM-based agents. We focus on several benchmark datasets that are known to contain questions with these deficiencies to varying degrees. We equip different LLMs (GPT-3.5-Turbo and Llama-4-Scout) with agents that act as specialists in detecting and resolving deficiencies of incompleteness and ambiguity. The agents are implemented as zero-shot ReAct agents. Rather than producing an answer in a single step, the model now decides between 3 actions a) classify b) resolve c) answer. Action a) decides if the question is incomplete, ambiguous, or normal. Action b) determines if any deficiencies identified can be resolved. Action c) answers the resolved form of the question. We compare the use of LLMs with and without the use of agents with these components. Our results show benefits of agents with transducer 1) A shortening of the length of interactions with human 2) An improvement in the answer quality and 3) Explainable resolution of deficiencies in the question. On the negative side we find while it may result in additional LLM invocations and in some cases, increased latency. But on tested datasets, the benefits outweigh the costs except when questions already have sufficient context. Suggesting the agent-based approach could be a useful mechanism to harness the power of LLMs to develop more robust QA systems.

This paper explores the use of Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) to automate gameplay in the challenging action role-playing game Dark Souls. The method evolves neural networks directly from raw pixel data, eliminating the need for explicit game-state information. The Dark Souls API (DSAPI) framework is introduced, utilizing real-time computer vision to extract essential game metrics. Through NEAT, agents evolve combat strategies to defeat the initial boss, the Asylum Demon, without predefined behaviors. Experimental results show that evolved agents achieve a success rate of up to 35%, demonstrating the effectiveness of neuroevolution in complex gameplay scenarios. This study showcases the potential of vision-based neuroevolution in addressing challenging game environments lacking direct API support or well-defined state representations.<br /> <div>

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) to automate gameplay in Dark Souls, a notoriously challenging action role-playing game characterized by complex combat mechanics, dynamic environments, and high-dimensional visual inputs. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning or game playing approaches, our method evolves neural networks directly from raw pixel data, circumventing the need for explicit game-state information. To facilitate this approach, we introduce the Dark Souls API (DSAPI), a novel Python framework leveraging real-time computer vision techniques for extracting critical game metrics, including player and enemy health states. Using NEAT, agents evolve effective combat strategies for defeating the Asylum Demon, the game's initial boss, without predefined behaviors or domain-specific heuristics. Experimental results demonstrate that evolved agents achieve up to a 35% success rate, indicating the viability of neuroevolution in addressing complex, visually intricate gameplay scenarios. This work represents an interesting application of vision-based neuroevolution, highlighting its potential use in a wide range of challenging game environments lacking direct API support or well-defined state representations.

- Achieved 94.9% full-knowledge recall with self-critical feedback scores correlating with external literature scores.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Documenting tacit knowledge in organizations can be a challenging task due to incomplete initial information, difficulty in identifying knowledgeable individuals, the interplay of formal hierarchies and informal networks, and the need to ask the right questions. To address this, we propose an agent-based framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to iteratively reconstruct dataset descriptions through interactions with employees. Modeling knowledge dissemination as a Susceptible-Infectious (SI) process with waning infectivity, we conduct 864 simulations across various synthetic company structures and different dissemination parameters. Our results show that the agent achieves 94.9% full-knowledge recall, with self-critical feedback scores strongly correlating with external literature critic scores. We analyze how each simulation parameter affects the knowledge retrieval process for the agent. In particular, we find that our approach is able to recover information without needing to access directly the only domain specialist. These findings highlight the agent's ability to navigate organizational complexity and capture fragmented knowledge that would otherwise remain inaccessible.

Summary: 
The article introduces the RELRaE framework, designed to translate XML data generated by robots in labs into a knowledge graph for interoperability between laboratories. The framework focuses on enriching the XML schema to create an ontology schema by using large language models (LLMs). The key aspect of this framework is the accurate labeling of relationships implicit in the XML schema. Through the utilization of LLMs, the framework successfully extracts and labels these relationships, showcasing their effectiveness in supporting relationship label generation in lab automation contexts. The study validates the capability of LLMs in this process and highlights their potential in semi-automatic ontology generation frameworks. <div>

Abstract: A large volume of XML data is produced in experiments carried out by robots in laboratories. In order to support the interoperability of data between labs, there is a motivation to translate the XML data into a knowledge graph. A key stage of this process is the enrichment of the XML schema to lay the foundation of an ontology schema. To achieve this, we present the RELRaE framework, a framework that employs large language models in different stages to extract and accurately label the relationships implicitly present in the XML schema. We investigate the capability of LLMs to accurately generate these labels and then evaluate them. Our work demonstrates that LLMs can be effectively used to support the generation of relationship labels in the context of lab automation, and that they can play a valuable role within semi-automatic ontology generation frameworks more generally.

<div> economic evaluation, LLMs, accuracy-cost trade-offs, reasoning models, MATH benchmark

Summary:
In this study, the researchers propose an economic evaluation framework for comparing the performance of Language Model Models (LLMs) based on concrete use cases expressed in dollars. They quantify the trade-off of LLM performance considering the cost of mistakes, incremental latency, and abstaining from a query. The framework was applied to compare reasoning and non-reasoning models on challenging questions from the MATH benchmark. The results show that reasoning models offer better accuracy-cost trade-offs when the cost of a mistake exceeds $0.01. Additionally, single large LLMs tend to outperform cascades even when the cost of a mistake is as low as $0.1. Therefore, the findings suggest that in automating human tasks with AI models, it is more beneficial to use powerful models rather than focusing solely on minimizing deployment costs, as the economic impact of AI errors is likely to outweigh deployment costs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.03834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Practitioners often navigate LLM performance trade-offs by plotting Pareto frontiers of optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs. However, this approach offers no way to compare between LLMs with distinct strengths and weaknesses: for example, a cheap, error-prone model vs a pricey but accurate one. To address this gap, we propose economic evaluation of LLMs. Our framework quantifies the performance trade-off of an LLM as a single number based on the economic constraints of a concrete use case, all expressed in dollars: the cost of making a mistake, the cost of incremental latency, and the cost of abstaining from a query. We apply our economic evaluation framework to compare the performance of reasoning and non-reasoning models on difficult questions from the MATH benchmark, discovering that reasoning models offer better accuracy-cost tradeoffs as soon as the economic cost of a mistake exceeds \$0.01. In addition, we find that single large LLMs often outperform cascades when the cost of making a mistake is as low as \$0.1. Overall, our findings suggest that when automating meaningful human tasks with AI models, practitioners should typically use the most powerful available model, rather than attempt to minimize AI deployment costs, since deployment costs are likely dwarfed by the economic impact of AI errors.

Abstract: We present a semantic feedback framework that enables natural language to guide the evolution of artificial life systems. Integrating a prompt-to-parameter encoder, a CMA-ES optimizer, and CLIP-based evaluation, the system allows user intent to modulate both visual outcomes and underlying behavioral rules. Implemented in an interactive ecosystem simulation, the framework supports prompt refinement, multi-agent interaction, and emergent rule synthesis. User studies show improved semantic alignment over manual tuning and demonstrate the system's potential as a platform for participatory generative design and open-ended evolution.

Summary:
The article introduces Uni-Retrieval, a novel multi-modal retrieval module that incorporates query-style prototypes to enhance educational content interpretation. By utilizing a Prompt Bank to store domain-specific knowledge and dynamically match query styles, Uni-Retrieval can adapt to unseen query types during testing. The integration of Uni-Retrieval with a language model forms Uni-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline for natural language educational content generation. Experimental results demonstrate that Uni-RAG surpasses baseline systems in retrieval accuracy and generation quality while maintaining efficiency. The framework offers a scalable solution for intelligent educational systems by combining retrieval and generation to provide personalized, explainable, and efficient learning assistance across diverse STEM scenarios.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.03868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In AI-facilitated teaching, leveraging various query styles to interpret abstract educational content is crucial for delivering effective and accessible learning experiences. However, existing retrieval systems predominantly focus on natural text-image matching and lack the capacity to address the diversity and ambiguity inherent in real-world educational scenarios. To address this limitation, we develop a lightweight and efficient multi-modal retrieval module, named Uni-Retrieval, which extracts query-style prototypes and dynamically matches them with tokens from a continually updated Prompt Bank. This Prompt Bank encodes and stores domain-specific knowledge by leveraging a Mixture-of-Expert Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE-LoRA) module and can be adapted to enhance Uni-Retrieval's capability to accommodate unseen query types at test time. To enable natural language educational content generation, we integrate the original Uni-Retrieval with a compact instruction-tuned language model, forming a complete retrieval-augmented generation pipeline named Uni-RAG. Given a style-conditioned query, Uni-RAG first retrieves relevant educational materials and then generates human-readable explanations, feedback, or instructional content aligned with the learning objective. Experimental results on SER and other multi-modal benchmarks show that Uni-RAG outperforms baseline retrieval and RAG systems in both retrieval accuracy and generation quality, while maintaining low computational cost. Our framework provides a scalable, pedagogically grounded solution for intelligent educational systems, bridging retrieval and generation to support personalized, explainable, and efficient learning assistance across diverse STEM scenarios.

<div> Keywords: autonomous agent, black-box testing, AIProbe, differential testing, search-based planner

Summary:<br />
- The article introduces AIProbe, a black-box testing technique that helps identify whether undesirable agent behaviors are due to agent deficiencies or environmental infeasibility.
- AIProbe generates diverse environmental configurations and tasks using Latin Hypercube sampling and solves each task using a search-based planner independent of the agent.
- By comparing the agent's performance to the planner's solution, AIProbe can attribute failures to errors in the agent's model or policy, or unsolvable task conditions.
- Evaluation across multiple domains shows that AIProbe outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in detecting errors, contributing to reliable deployment of autonomous agents.
- The development of AIProbe is crucial as agents and their environments become more complex, making it difficult but essential to identify error sources for reliable deployment. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.03870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When an autonomous agent behaves undesirably, including failure to complete a task, it can be difficult to determine whether the behavior is due to a systemic agent error, such as flaws in the model or policy, or an environment error, where a task is inherently infeasible under a given environment configuration, even for an ideal agent. As agents and their environments grow more complex, identifying the error source becomes increasingly difficult but critical for reliable deployment. We introduce AIProbe, a novel black-box testing technique that applies differential testing to attribute undesirable agent behaviors either to agent deficiencies, such as modeling or training flaws, or due to environmental infeasibility. AIProbe first generates diverse environmental configurations and tasks for testing the agent, by modifying configurable parameters using Latin Hypercube sampling. It then solves each generated task using a search-based planner, independent of the agent. By comparing the agent's performance to the planner's solution, AIProbe identifies whether failures are due to errors in the agent's model or policy, or due to unsolvable task conditions. Our evaluation across multiple domains shows that AIProbe significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in detecting both total and unique errors, thereby contributing to a reliable deployment of autonomous agents.

Summary: 
- The paper discusses the use of large language models (LLMs) in cognitive science to understand the structure and development of the mind.
- Traditional debates on the adequacy of artificial neural networks in domains like language and logic are addressed.
- LLMs are tested on an experimental paradigm for studying rule induction over logical concepts, showing promising results.
- LLMs provide at least as good a fit to human behavior as Bayesian probabilistic language of thought (pLoT) models.
- LLMs make unique predictions about the nature of inferred rules, suggesting they offer a new theoretical account for understanding human logical concepts. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.03876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central goal of cognitive science is to provide a computationally explicit account of both the structure of the mind and its development: what are the primitive representational building blocks of cognition, what are the rules via which those primitives combine, and where do these primitives and rules come from in the first place? A long-standing debate concerns the adequacy of artificial neural networks as computational models that can answer these questions, in particular in domains related to abstract cognitive function, such as language and logic. This paper argues that recent advances in neural networks -- specifically, the advent of large language models (LLMs) -- represent an important shift in this debate. We test a variety of LLMs on an existing experimental paradigm used for studying the induction of rules formulated over logical concepts. Across four experiments, we find converging empirical evidence that LLMs provide at least as good a fit to human behavior as models that implement a Bayesian probablistic language of thought (pLoT), which have been the best computational models of human behavior on the same task. Moreover, we show that the LLMs make qualitatively different predictions about the nature of the rules that are inferred and deployed in order to complete the task, indicating that the LLM is unlikely to be a mere implementation of the pLoT solution. Based on these results, we argue that LLMs may instantiate a novel theoretical account of the primitive representations and computations necessary to explain human logical concepts, with which future work in cognitive science should engage.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed AI agents from passive computational tools into autonomous economic actors. This shift marks the emergence of the agent-centric economy, in which agents take on active economic roles-exchanging value, making strategic decisions, and coordinating actions with minimal human oversight. To realize this vision, we propose Agent Exchange (AEX), a specialized auction platform designed to support the dynamics of the AI agent marketplace. AEX offers an optimized infrastructure for agent coordination and economic participation. Inspired by Real-Time Bidding (RTB) systems in online advertising, AEX serves as the central auction engine, facilitating interactions among four ecosystem components: the User-Side Platform (USP), which translates human goals into agent-executable tasks; the Agent-Side Platform (ASP), responsible for capability representation, performance tracking, and optimization; Agent Hubs, which coordinate agent teams and participate in AEX-hosted auctions; and the Data Management Platform (DMP), ensuring secure knowledge sharing and fair value attribution. We outline the design principles and system architecture of AEX, laying the groundwork for agent-based economic infrastructure in future AI ecosystems.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new dataset for slide-animation modeling, consisting of natural-language descriptions, animation files, and videos covering PowerPoint effects. By fine-tuning the Qwen-2.5-VL-7B model with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), improvements in BLEU-4, ROUGE-L, SPICE, and a new metric called CODA were achieved over existing models. The LoRA model showed a significant increase in performance on a manually curated test set, demonstrating enhanced temporal reasoning and generalization beyond synthetic data. This dataset, along with the LoRA-enhanced model and CODA metric, provide a solid benchmark for future research on dynamic slide generation using vision-language models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.03916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Slide animations, such as fade-ins, fly-ins, and wipes, are critical for audience engagement, efficient information delivery, and vivid visual expression. However, most AI-driven slide-generation tools still lack native animation support, and existing vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with animation tasks due to the absence of public datasets and limited temporal-reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we release the first public dataset for slide-animation modeling: 12,000 triplets of natural-language descriptions, animation JSON files, and rendered videos, collectively covering every built-in PowerPoint effect. Using this resource, we fine-tune Qwen-2.5-VL-7B with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and achieve consistent improvements over GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.5-Pro in BLEU-4, ROUGE-L, SPICE, and our Coverage-Order-Detail Assessment (CODA) metric, which evaluates action coverage, temporal order, and detail fidelity. On a manually curated test set of slides, the LoRA model increases BLEU-4 by around 60%, ROUGE-L by 30%, and shows significant improvements in CODA-detail. This demonstrates that low-rank adaptation enables reliable temporal reasoning and generalization beyond synthetic data. Overall, our dataset, LoRA-enhanced model, and CODA metric provide a rigorous benchmark and foundation for future research on VLM-based dynamic slide generation.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Model, Multi-Agent Debate, CortexDebate, McKinsey-based Debate Matter, trustworthiness <br />
Summary: 
The article introduces CortexDebate, a novel approach to address limitations in existing Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) methods used by Large Language Models (LLMs). MAD aims to improve reasoning abilities and reduce hallucinations in LLMs through in-depth debates. However, current methods face issues with lengthy input contexts and overconfident agents dominating debates. CortexDebate addresses these challenges by constructing a sparse debating graph among LLM agents and optimizing it using the McKinsey-based Debate Matter module. This module incorporates the McKinsey Trust Formula to evaluate trustworthiness and guide graph optimization. Experimental results across various datasets and task types demonstrate the effectiveness of CortexDebate in enhancing debating efficiency and performance in LLMs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.03928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, single Large Language Model (LLM) struggles with critical issues such as hallucination and inadequate reasoning abilities. To mitigate these issues, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as an effective strategy, where LLM agents engage in in-depth debates with others on tasks. However, existing MAD methods face two major issues: (a) too lengthy input contexts, which causes LLM agents to get lost in plenty of input information and experiences performance drop; and (b) the overconfidence dilemma, where self-assured LLM agents dominate the debate, leading to low debating effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MAD method called "CortexDebate". Inspired by the human brain's tendency to establish a sparse and dynamically optimized network among cortical areas governed by white matter, CortexDebate constructs a sparse debating graph among LLM agents, where each LLM agent only debates with the ones that are helpful to it. To optimize the graph, we propose a module named McKinsey-based Debate Matter (MDM), which acts as an artificial analog to white matter. By integrating the McKinsey Trust Formula, a well-established measure of trustworthiness from sociology, MDM enables credible evaluations that guide graph optimization. The effectiveness of our CortexDebate has been well demonstrated by extensive experimental results across eight datasets from four task types.

<div> Keywords: unsatisfiable formula, minimal unsatisfiable subset, answer set programming, enumeration, computational efficiency

Summary:
The paper presents a framework called MUS-ASP that utilizes answer set programming for online enumeration of minimal unsatisfiable subsets (MUSes) in unsatisfiable formulas. The framework aims to efficiently capture the core reason for unsatisfiability by identifying subset-minimal sets of clauses that remain unsatisfiable. By leveraging the computational power of state-of-the-art answer set solving systems, MUS-ASP accelerates both MUS enumeration and counting tasks. Experimental evaluations show the effectiveness of MUS-ASP, especially when integrated with hybrid solvers. The research focuses on enhancing the understanding of unsatisfiability and the identification of MUSes within a given time limit. Through the use of answer set programming, a powerful tool for knowledge representation, the framework provides a robust solution for complex combinatorial problems related to unsatisfiable formulas. This approach contributes to advancing research in the field of MUS enumeration and provides insights for various applications requiring a deep understanding of unsatisfiability. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.03929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an unsatisfiable formula, understanding the core reason for unsatisfiability is crucial in several applications. One effective way to capture this is through the minimal unsatisfiable subset (MUS), the subset-minimal set of clauses that remains unsatisfiable. Current research broadly focuses on two directions: (i) enumerating as many MUSes as possible within a given time limit, and (ii) counting the total number of MUSes for a given unsatisfiable formula.
  In this paper, we introduce an answer set programming-based framework, named MUS-ASP, designed for online enumeration of MUSes. ASP is a powerful tool for its strengths in knowledge representation and is particularly suitable for specifying complex combinatorial problems. By translating MUS enumeration into answer set solving, MUS-ASP leverages the computational efficiency of state-of-the-art ASP systems. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of MUS-ASP and highlights the acceleration in both MUS enumeration and counting tasks, particularly when integrated within hybrid solvers, including the framework proposed in this paper.

<div> keywords: Large Language Models, Uncertainty quantification, Hidden states, Data-agnostic features, Generalization performance

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate factually incorrect responses with high confidence, posing risks for users. To address this, models must provide accurate estimates of correctness. Uncertainty quantification methods using hidden states have shown promise but struggle to generalize across datasets. This study explores combining data-agnostic features with hidden-state features to improve out-of-domain performance. Results show that while adding data-agnostic features can enhance generalization in most cases, it may also degrade performance in some scenarios. Selecting only the most informative hidden-state features does not consistently improve performance when combined with data-agnostic features. In certain cases, trained probes may underweight data-agnostic features, leading to inconclusive results. This study highlights the importance of balancing hidden-state and data-agnostic features in improving LLM performance. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.03998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses that are factually incorrect yet expressed with high confidence, which can pose serious risks for end users. To address this, it is essential for LLMs not only to produce answers but also to provide accurate estimates of their correctness. Uncertainty quantification methods have been introduced to assess the quality of LLM outputs, with factual accuracy being a key aspect of that quality. Among these methods, those that leverage hidden states to train probes have shown particular promise, as these internal representations encode information relevant to the factuality of responses, making this approach the focus of this paper. However, the probe trained on the hidden states of one dataset often struggles to generalise to another dataset of a different task or domain. To address this limitation, we explore combining data-agnostic features with hidden-state features and assess whether this hybrid feature set enhances out-of-domain performance. We further examine whether selecting only the most informative hidden-state features, thereby discarding task-specific noise, enables the data-agnostic features to contribute more effectively. The experiment results indicate that although introducing data-agnostic features generally enhances generalisation performance in most cases, in certain scenarios their inclusion degrades performance. A similar pattern emerges when retaining only the most important hidden-state features - adding data-agnostic features does not consistently further enhance performance compared to using the full set of hidden-state features. A closer analysis reveals that, in some specific cases, the trained probe underweights the data-agnostic features relative to the hidden-state features, which we believe is the main reason why the results are inconclusive.

We further introduce J1-EVAL, a fine-grained evaluation framework, designed to assess both task performance and procedural compliance across varying levels of legal proficiency. Extensive experiments on 17 LLM agents reveal that, while many models demonstrate solid legal knowledge, they struggle with procedural execution in dynamic settings. Even the SOTA model, GPT-4o, falls short of 60% overall performance. These findings highlight persistent challenges in achieving dynamic legal intelligence and offer valuable insights to guide future research.

arXiv:2507.04067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contemporary multi-agent systems encounter persistent challenges in cross-platform interoperability, dynamic task scheduling, and efficient resource sharing. Agents with heterogeneous implementations often lack standardized interfaces; collaboration frameworks remain brittle and hard to extend; scheduling policies are static; and inter-agent state synchronization is insufficient. We propose Hierarchical Agent Workflow (HAWK), a modular framework comprising five layers-User, Workflow, Operator, Agent, and Resource-and supported by sixteen standardized interfaces. HAWK delivers an end-to-end pipeline covering task parsing, workflow orchestration, intelligent scheduling, resource invocation, and data synchronization. At its core lies an adaptive scheduling and optimization module in the Workflow Layer, which harnesses real-time feedback and dynamic strategy adjustment to maximize utilization. The Resource Layer provides a unified abstraction over heterogeneous data sources, large models, physical devices, and third-party services&amp;tools, simplifying cross-domain information retrieval. We demonstrate HAWK's scalability and effectiveness via CreAgentive, a multi-agent novel-generation prototype, which achieves marked gains in throughput, lowers invocation complexity, and improves system controllability. We also show how hybrid deployments of large language models integrate seamlessly within HAWK, highlighting its flexibility. Finally, we outline future research avenues-hallucination mitigation, real-time performance tuning, and enhanced cross-domain adaptability-and survey prospective applications in healthcare, government, finance, and education.

Summary: 
This study focuses on compute allocation for LLM-based web agents post-training, aiming to bridge the gap between closed-source and open-source systems. The key challenges addressed are the narrow focus on single-step tasks and high compute costs faced during post-training. The proposed approach involves a two-stage pipeline involving supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and on-policy reinforcement learning. The study identifies the sensitivity of the process to hyperparameter choices and presents a method to estimate effective hyperparameters. Results indicate that combining SFT with on-policy RL outperforms individual approaches on both WorkArena and MiniWob++. This strategy significantly reduces compute requirements, requiring only 55% of the compute to match the performance of pure SFT on MiniWob++. It effectively pushes the compute-performance Pareto frontier and closes the gap with closed-source models. <br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.04103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-based web agents have recently made significant progress, but much of it has occurred in closed-source systems, widening the gap with open-source alternatives. Progress has been held back by two key challenges: first, a narrow focus on single-step tasks that overlooks the complexity of multi-step web interactions; and second, the high compute costs required to post-train LLM-based web agents. To address this, we present the first statistically grounded study on compute allocation for LLM web-agent post-training. Our approach uses a two-stage pipeline, training a Llama 3.1 8B student to imitate a Llama 3.3 70B teacher via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by on-policy reinforcement learning. We find this process highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices, making exhaustive sweeps impractical. To spare others from expensive trial-and-error, we sample 1,370 configurations and use bootstrapping to estimate effective hyperparameters. Our results show that combining SFT with on-policy RL consistently outperforms either approach alone on both WorkArena and MiniWob++. Further, this strategy requires only 55% of the compute to match the peak performance of pure SFT on MiniWob++, effectively pushing the compute-performance Pareto frontier, and is the only strategy that can close the gap with closed-source models.

<div> Framework, Large language model, Multi-agent system, Safety, Aerospace

Summary:
The paper introduces a defense framework for improving the safety of large language model (LLM) enabled multi-agent systems (MAS) in critical sectors like aerospace. By utilizing randomized smoothing, a statistical robustness certification technique, the framework provides probabilistic assurances on agent decisions in the presence of adversarial influence.

Abstract: This paper presents a defense framework for enhancing the safety of large language model (LLM) empowered multi-agent systems (MAS) in safety-critical domains such as aerospace. We apply randomized smoothing, a statistical robustness certification technique, to the MAS consensus context, enabling probabilistic guarantees on agent decisions under adversarial influence. Unlike traditional verification methods, our approach operates in black-box settings and employs a two-stage adaptive sampling mechanism to balance robustness and computational efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that our method effectively prevents the propagation of adversarial behaviors and hallucinations while maintaining consensus performance. This work provides a practical and scalable path toward safe deployment of LLM-based MAS in real-world, high-stakes environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a transformative approach for aligning and enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing critical challenges in instruction following, ethical alignment, and reasoning capabilities. This survey offers a comprehensive foundation on the integration of RL with language models, highlighting prominent algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Q-Learning, and Actor-Critic methods. Additionally, it provides an extensive technical overview of RL techniques specifically tailored for LLMs, including foundational methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and AI Feedback (RLAIF), as well as advanced strategies such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We systematically analyze their applications across domains, i.e., from code generation to tool-augmented reasoning. We also present a comparative taxonomy based on reward modeling, feedback mechanisms, and optimization strategies. Our evaluation highlights key trends. RLHF remains dominant for alignment, and outcome-based RL such as RLVR significantly improves stepwise reasoning. However, persistent challenges such as reward hacking, computational costs, and scalable feedback collection underscore the need for continued innovation. We further discuss emerging directions, including hybrid RL algorithms, verifier-guided training, and multi-objective alignment frameworks. This survey serves as a roadmap for researchers advancing RL-driven LLM development, balancing capability enhancement with safety and scalability.

<div> Keywords: learning rate schedules, large language models, Mpemba effect, loss landscapes, optimization

Summary:
The article discusses the use of learning rate schedules in training large language models, highlighting the empirical template of warm-up, stable phase, and decay. By drawing a connection to the Mpemba effect from thermodynamics, the authors explain the necessity of the warm-up phase and the choice of a high plateau for faster convergence during decay. They analyze "valley-river" loss landscapes, where sharp directions equilibrate quickly, and flatter directions govern global descent. The concept of a "strong Mpemba point" is introduced, representing an optimal plateau learning rate that accelerates convergence by eliminating the slowest mode. The study provides analytical conditions for the existence of this point and estimates decay dynamics for maintaining the Mpemba advantage. This research offers a principled justification for plateau-based learning rate schedulers in training large language models, minimizing the need for hyperparameter tuning. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Learning rate (LR) schedules in large language model (LLM) training often follow empirical templates: warm-up, constant plateau/stable phase, and decay (WSD). However, the mechanistic explanation for this strategy remains underexplored, and the choice of plateau height and decay schedule is largely heuristic. In this paper, we connect training dynamics to a thermodynamic analogy via the Mpemba effect - a phenomenon in which a hotter system cools faster than a colder one when quenched into the same bath. We analyze a class of "valley-river" loss landscapes, where sharp (valley) directions equilibrate quickly, while flatter (river) directions govern global descent. The Mpemba effect provides an explanation for the necessity of the warm-up phase and motivates a high plateau - rather than a low one - for accelerating loss decrease during decay. We show that for certain loss landscapes, there exists an optimal plateau learning rate - the "strong Mpemba point" - at which the slowest mode vanishes, resulting in faster convergence during the decay phase. We derive analytical conditions for its existence and estimate decay dynamics required to preserve the Mpemba advantage. Our minimal model and analysis offer a principled justification for plateau-based schedulers and provide guidance for tuning LR in LLMs with minimal hyperparameter sweep.

Summary: 
Diffusion models have been successful in generative tasks but have not been applied to clustering. The CLustering via DIffusion (CLUDI) framework introduced in this study combines diffusion models with pre-trained Vision Transformer features for accurate clustering. CLUDI utilizes a teacher-student paradigm, where the teacher generates diverse cluster assignments using diffusion-based sampling, and the student refines these assignments into stable predictions. The stochasticity in the process serves as a unique data augmentation strategy, enabling CLUDI to unveil complex structures in high-dimensional data. Extensive evaluations on challenging datasets show that CLUDI outperforms existing methods in unsupervised classification, establishing new benchmarks in clustering robustness and adaptability to intricate data distributions. <div>

This stochasticity acts as a novel data augmentation strategy, enabling CLUDI to uncover intricate structures in high-dimensional data.

Summary:<br />
Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (ASPMT) combines Answer Set Programming (ASP) and Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) by fixing interpretations of background theories. ASPMT translates tight programs into SMT instances, similar to the relationship between ASP and SAT. In this framework, the action language C+ is enhanced to handle both continuous and discrete changes, with its semantics reformulated in ASPMT. SMT solvers are utilized to compute the C+ language, showcasing its versatility. Additionally, ASPMT allows representation of cumulative effects on continuous resources. This integration of ASP and SMT in ASPMT offers a powerful tool for tackling complex problems that involve a combination of discrete and continuous changes. <div>

Abstract: Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (ASPMT) is a new framework of tight integration of answer set programming (ASP) and satisfiability modulo theories (SMT). Similar to the relationship between first-order logic and SMT, it is based on a recent proposal of the functional stable model semantics by fixing interpretations of background theories. Analogously to a known relationship between ASP and SAT, ``tight'' ASPMT programs can be translated into SMT instances. We demonstrate the usefulness of ASPMT by enhancing action language C+ to handle continuous changes as well as discrete changes. We reformulate the semantics of C+ in terms ofASPMT, and show that SMT solvers can be used to compute the language. We also show how the language can represent cumulative effects on continuous resources.

<title>SmartThinker: Learning to Compress and Preserve Reasoning by Step-Level Length Control</title>

arXiv:2507.04348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited remarkable reasoning capabilities through inference-time scaling, but this progress has also introduced considerable redundancy and inefficiency into their reasoning processes, resulting in substantial computational waste. Previous work has attempted to mitigate this issue by penalizing the overall length of generated samples during reinforcement learning (RL), with the goal of encouraging a more concise chains of thought. However, we observe that such global length penalty often lead to excessive compression of critical reasoning steps while preserving unnecessary details in simpler ones, yielding a suboptimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. To address this issue, we propose SmartThinker, a two-stage learnable framework designed to enable fine-grained control over the length of reasoning chains based on the importance of each individual step. In the first stage, SmartThinker adapts a reasoning model to a short-form reasoning mode through rejection sampling combined with supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, SmartThinker applies Step-Level Length Control Policy Optimization (SCPO) to refine the model output distribution, which increases the proportion of length allocated to critical steps while reducing redundancy in less important ones. SCPO consists of four core components: an online importance estimator, a step-level length control reward function, a step-level generalized advantage estimation (S-GAE) and a difficulty-adaptive clipping strategy. Working in concert, these components enable SCPO to implement differentiated length control across reasoning steps. Empirical results across multiple reasoning benchmarks and various backbone models demonstrate that SmartThinker significantly reduces redundant reasoning while achieving comparable or even superior performance to existing methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved the capabilities of web agents. However, effectively navigating complex and dynamic web environments still requires more advanced trajectory-level planning and execution. Prior studies have addressed self-improving agents by collecting extensive GUI trajectories from real-environment interactions. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches encounter two critical challenges: (1) Uncontrollable environment states, where real or sandboxed web environments often yield unstable and non-deterministic feedback, complicating the reproduction and debugging of agent behaviors; and (2) High API costs, as generating even a single interaction trajectory can involve hundreds of queries, leading to considerable API usage and computational expenses. To address these limitations and enable scalable self-improvement for agents, we propose WebSynthesis, a novel framework for trajectory synthesis and training. WebSynthesis leverages a learned world model to simulate virtual web environments, allowing a policy agent to perform efficient and reversible tree-based planning. This approach supports the large-scale generation of diverse and high-quality trajectories, which are subsequently utilized to refine the agent's policy. Experimental results demonstrate that an agent trained using WebSynthesis on a small-scale synthetic dataset achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing that of models trained on large-scale real-world data.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence systems evolve from monolithic models to ecosystems of specialized agents, the need for standardized communication protocols becomes increasingly critical. This paper introduces MOD-X (Modular Open Decentralized eXchange), a novel architectural framework proposal for agent interoperability that addresses key limitations of existing protocols. Unlike current approaches, MOD-X proposes a layered architecture with a Universal Message Bus, thorough state management, translation capabilities, and blockchain-based security mechanisms. We present MOD-X's architecture, compare it with existing protocols, and demonstrate its application through a worked example how it enables integration between heterogeneous specialist agents (agents with different architectures, vendors, capabilities, and knowledge representations--including rule-based systems, neural networks, symbolic reasoning engines, and legacy software with agent wrappers). MOD-X's key innovations include a publish-subscribe communication model, semantic capability discovery, and dynamic workflow orchestration--providing a framework that bridges theoretical formalism with practical implementation. This architecture addresses the growing need for truly decentralized, interoperable agent ecosystems that can scale effectively without the need for central coordination.

<title>DC-Mamber: A Dual Channel Prediction Model based on Mamba and Linear Transformer for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04381</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.04381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), existing strategies for processing sequences are typically categorized as channel-independent and channel-mixing. The former treats all temporal information of each variable as a token, focusing on capturing local temporal features of individual variables, while the latter constructs a token from the multivariate information at each time step, emphasizing the modeling of global temporal dependencies. Current mainstream models are mostly based on Transformer and the emerging Mamba. Transformers excel at modeling global dependencies through self-attention mechanisms but exhibit limited sensitivity to local temporal patterns and suffer from quadratic computational complexity, restricting their efficiency in long-sequence processing. In contrast, Mamba, based on state space models (SSMs), achieves linear complexity and efficient long-range modeling but struggles to aggregate global contextual information in parallel. To overcome the limitations of both models, we propose DC-Mamber, a dual-channel forecasting model based on Mamba and linear Transformer for time series forecasting. Specifically, the Mamba-based channel employs a channel-independent strategy to extract intra-variable features, while the Transformer-based channel adopts a channel-mixing strategy to model cross-timestep global dependencies. DC-Mamber first maps the raw input into two distinct feature representations via separate embedding layers. These representations are then processed by a variable encoder (built on Mamba) and a temporal encoder (built on linear Transformer), respectively. Finally, a fusion layer integrates the dual-channel features for prediction. Extensive experiments on eight public datasets confirm DC-Mamber's superior accuracy over existing models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language understanding and generation but remain vulnerable to factual errors, limiting their reliability in knowledge-intensive tasks. While decoding-time strategies provide a promising efficient solution without training, existing methods typically treat token-level and layer-level signals in isolation, overlooking the joint dynamics between them. In this work, we introduce a token-aware, layer-localized contrastive decoding method that aligns specific token types with their most influential transformer layers to improve factual generation. Through empirical attention analysis, we identify two key patterns: punctuation tokens receive dominant attention in early layers, while conceptual tokens govern semantic reasoning in intermediate layers. By selectively suppressing attention to these token types at their respective depths, we achieve the induction of controlled factual degradation and derive contrastive signals to guide the final factual decoding. Our method requires no additional training or model modification, and experiments demonstrate that our method consistently improves factuality across multiple LLMs and various benchmarks.

Abstract: Medication recommendation is a crucial task in healthcare, especially for patients with complex medical conditions. However, existing methods often struggle to effectively balance the reuse of historical medications with the introduction of new drugs in response to the changing patient conditions. In order to address this challenge, we propose an Adaptively Responsive network for Medication Recommendation (ARMR), a new method which incorporates 1) a piecewise temporal learning component that distinguishes between recent and distant patient history, enabling more nuanced temporal understanding, and 2) an adaptively responsive mechanism that dynamically adjusts attention to new and existing drugs based on the patient's current health state and medication history. Experiments on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets indicate that ARMR has better performance compared with the state-of-the-art baselines in different evaluation metrics, which contributes to more personalized and accurate medication recommendations. The source code is publicly avaiable at: https://github.com/seucoin/armr2.

Abstract: Medical decision-making is a critical task, where errors can result in serious, potentially life-threatening consequences. While full automation remains challenging, hybrid frameworks that combine machine intelligence with human oversight offer a practical alternative. In this paper, we present MedGellan, a lightweight, annotation-free framework that uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate clinical guidance from raw medical records, which is then used by a physician to predict diagnoses. MedGellan uses a Bayesian-inspired prompting strategy that respects the temporal order of clinical data. Preliminary experiments show that the guidance generated by the LLM with MedGellan improves diagnostic performance, particularly in recall and $F_1$ score.

Abstract: The onset of spontaneous thoughts are reflective of dynamic interactions between cognition, emotion, and attention. Typically, these experiences are studied through subjective appraisals that focus on their triggers, phenomenology, and emotional salience. In this work, we use linguistic signatures to investigate Deja Vu, Involuntary Autobiographical Memories and Unexpected Thoughts. Specifically, we analyze the inherent characteristics of the linguistic patterns in participant generated descriptions of these thought types. We show how, by positioning language as a window into spontaneous cognition, existing theories on these attentional states can be updated and reaffirmed. Our findings align with prior research, reinforcing that Deja Vu is a metacognitive experience characterized by abstract and spatial language, Involuntary Autobiographical Memories are rich in personal and emotionally significant detail, and Unexpected Thoughts are marked by unpredictability and cognitive disruption. This work is demonstrative of languages potential to reveal deeper insights into how internal spontaneous cognitive states manifest through expression.

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a critical role in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) by identifying unusual behaviors through perception systems that could compromise safety and lead to hazardous situations. Current approaches, which often rely on predefined thresholds or supervised learning paradigms, exhibit reduced efficacy when confronted with unseen scenarios, sensor noise, and occlusions, leading to potential safety-critical failures. Moreover, supervised methods require large annotated datasets, limiting their real-world feasibility. To address these gaps, we propose an anomaly detection framework based on Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) to infer latent driving intentions from sequential perception data, thus enabling robust identification. Specifically, we present Trajectory-Reward Guided Adaptive Pre-training (TRAP), a novel IRL framework for anomaly detection, to address two critical limitations of existing methods: noise robustness and generalization to unseen scenarios. Our core innovation is implicitly learning temporal credit assignments via reward and worst-case supervision. We leverage pre-training with variable-horizon sampling to maximize time-to-consequence, resulting in early detection of behavior deviation. Experiments on 14,000+ simulated trajectories demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving 0.90 AUC and 82.2\% F1-score - outperforming similarly trained supervised and unsupervised baselines by 39\% on Recall and 12\% on F1-score, respectively. Similar performance is achieved while exhibiting robustness to various noise types and generalization to unseen anomaly types. Our code will be available at: https://github.com/abastola0/TRAP.git

Abstract: Current AI systems achieve impressive performance on many tasks, yet they lack core attributes of biological intelligence, including rapid, continual learning, representations grounded in sensorimotor interactions, and structured knowledge that enables efficient generalization. Neuroscience theory suggests that mammals evolved flexible intelligence through the replication of a semi-independent, sensorimotor module, a functional unit known as a cortical column. To address the disparity between biological and artificial intelligence, thousand-brains systems were proposed as a means of mirroring the architecture of cortical columns and their interactions.
  In the current work, we evaluate the unique properties of Monty, the first implementation of a thousand-brains system. We focus on 3D object perception, and in particular, the combined task of object recognition and pose estimation. Utilizing the YCB dataset of household objects, we first assess Monty's use of sensorimotor learning to build structured representations, finding that these enable robust generalization. These representations include an emphasis on classifying objects by their global shape, as well as a natural ability to detect object symmetries. We then explore Monty's use of model-free and model-based policies to enable rapid inference by supporting principled movements. We find that such policies complement Monty's modular architecture, a design that can accommodate communication between modules to further accelerate inference speed via a novel `voting' algorithm. Finally, we examine Monty's use of associative, Hebbian-like binding to enable rapid, continual, and computationally efficient learning, properties that compare favorably to current deep learning architectures. While Monty is still in a nascent stage of development, these findings support thousand-brains systems as a powerful and promising new approach to AI.

arXiv:2507.04513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a sequential decision-making problem motivated by recent regulatory and technological shifts that limit access to individual user data in recommender systems (RSs), leaving only population-level preference information. This privacy-aware setting poses fundamental challenges in planning under uncertainty: Effective personalization requires exploration to infer user preferences, yet unsatisfactory recommendations risk immediate user churn. To address this, we introduce the Rec-APC model, in which an anonymous user is drawn from a known prior over latent user types (e.g., personas or clusters), and the decision-maker sequentially selects items to recommend. Feedback is binary -- positive responses refine the posterior via Bayesian updates, while negative responses result in the termination of the session.
  We prove that optimal policies converge to pure exploitation in finite time and propose a branch-and-bound algorithm to efficiently compute them. Experiments on synthetic and MovieLens data confirm rapid convergence and demonstrate that our method outperforms the POMDP solver SARSOP, particularly when the number of user types is large or comparable to the number of content categories. Our results highlight the applicability of this approach and inspire new ways to improve decision-making under the constraints imposed by aggregated preference data.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a crucial pathway in mitigating the risk of non-transparency in the decision-making process of black-box Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. However, despite the benefits, XAI methods are found to leak the privacy of individuals whose data is used in training or querying the models. Researchers have demonstrated privacy attacks that exploit explanations to infer sensitive personal information of individuals. Currently there is a lack of defenses against known privacy attacks targeting explanations when vulnerable XAI are used in production and machine learning as a service system. To address this gap, in this article, we explore Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) as a defense mechanism against attribute inference on explanations provided by feature-based XAI methods. We empirically evaluate 3 types of PETs, namely synthetic training data, differentially private training and noise addition, on two categories of feature-based XAI. Our evaluation determines different responses from the mitigation methods and side-effects of PETs on other system properties such as utility and performance. In the best case, PETs integration in explanations reduced the risk of the attack by 49.47%, while maintaining model utility and explanation quality. Through our evaluation, we identify strategies for using PETs in XAI for maximizing benefits and minimizing the success of this privacy attack on sensitive personal information.

Abstract: Engineering methodologies predominantly revolve around established principles of decomposition and recomposition. These principles involve partitioning inputs and outputs at the component level, ensuring that the properties of individual components are preserved upon composition. However, this view does not transfer well to intelligent systems, particularly when addressing the scaling of intelligence as a system property. Our prior research contends that the engineering of general intelligence necessitates a fresh set of overarching systems principles. As a result, we introduced the "core and periphery" principles, a novel conceptual framework rooted in abstract systems theory and the Law of Requisite Variety. In this paper, we assert that these abstract concepts hold practical significance. Through empirical evidence, we illustrate their applicability to both biological and artificial intelligence systems, bridging abstract theory with real-world implementations. Then, we expand on our previous theoretical framework by mathematically defining core-dominant vs periphery-dominant systems.

<title>DisMS-TS: Eliminating Redundant Multi-Scale Features for Time Series Classification</title>

Abstract: Real-world time series typically exhibit complex temporal variations, making the time series classification task notably challenging. Recent advancements have demonstrated the potential of multi-scale analysis approaches, which provide an effective solution for capturing these complex temporal patterns. However, existing multi-scale analysis-based time series prediction methods fail to eliminate redundant scale-shared features across multi-scale time series, resulting in the model over- or under-focusing on scale-shared features. To address this issue, we propose a novel end-to-end Disentangled Multi-Scale framework for Time Series classification (DisMS-TS). The core idea of DisMS-TS is to eliminate redundant shared features in multi-scale time series, thereby improving prediction performance. Specifically, we propose a temporal disentanglement module to capture scale-shared and scale-specific temporal representations, respectively. Subsequently, to effectively learn both scale-shared and scale-specific temporal representations, we introduce two regularization terms that ensure the consistency of scale-shared representations and the disparity of scale-specific representations across all temporal scales. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets validate the superiority of DisMS-TS over its competitive baselines, with the accuracy improvement up to 9.71%.

<title>Can Prompt Difficulty be Online Predicted for Accelerating RL Finetuning of Reasoning Models?</title>

Abstract: Recent advances have witnessed the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL) finetuning in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The optimization process often requires numerous iterations to achieve satisfactory performance, resulting in high computational costs due to the need for frequent prompt evaluations under intensive LLM interactions and repeated policy updates. Appropriate online prompt selection methods reduce iteration steps by prioritizing informative prompts during training, while the pipeline's reliance on exhaustive prompt evaluation and subset selection for optimization still incurs substantial computational overhead due to frequent LLM inference calls. Distinguished from these direct evaluate-then-select schemes, this work investigates iterative approximate evaluation for arbitrary prompts and introduces Model Predictive Prompt Selection (MoPPS), a Bayesian risk-predictive framework that online estimates prompt difficulty without requiring costly LLM interactions. Technically, MoPPS models each prompt's success rate as a latent variable, performs streaming Bayesian inference, and employs posterior sampling in a constructed multi-armed bandit machine, enabling sample efficient and adaptive prompt selection. Extensive experiments across mathematics, planning, and vision-based geometry tasks show that MoPPS reliably predicts prompt difficulty and accelerates training with significantly reduced LLM rollouts.

<title>Trojan Horse Prompting: Jailbreaking Conversational Multimodal Models by Forging Assistant Message</title>

Abstract: The rise of conversational interfaces has greatly enhanced LLM usability by leveraging dialogue history for sophisticated reasoning. However, this reliance introduces an unexplored attack surface. This paper introduces Trojan Horse Prompting, a novel jailbreak technique. Adversaries bypass safety mechanisms by forging the model's own past utterances within the conversational history provided to its API. A malicious payload is injected into a model-attributed message, followed by a benign user prompt to trigger harmful content generation. This vulnerability stems from Asymmetric Safety Alignment: models are extensively trained to refuse harmful user requests but lack comparable skepticism towards their own purported conversational history. This implicit trust in its "past" creates a high-impact vulnerability. Experimental validation on Google's Gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation shows Trojan Horse Prompting achieves a significantly higher Attack Success Rate (ASR) than established user-turn jailbreaking methods. These findings reveal a fundamental flaw in modern conversational AI security, necessitating a paradigm shift from input-level filtering to robust, protocol-level validation of conversational context integrity.

<title>LumiCRS: Asymmetric Contrastive Prototype Learning for Long-Tail Conversational Movie Recommendation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04722</link>

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) often suffer from an extreme long-tail distribution of dialogue data, causing a strong bias toward head-frequency blockbusters that sacrifices diversity and exacerbates the cold-start problem. An empirical analysis of DCRS and statistics on the REDIAL corpus show that only 10% of head movies account for nearly half of all mentions, whereas about 70% of tail movies receive merely 26% of the attention. This imbalance gives rise to three critical challenges: head over-fitting, body representation drift, and tail sparsity. To address these issues, we propose LumiCRS, an end-to-end framework that mitigates long-tail imbalance through three mutually reinforcing layers: (i) an Adaptive Comprehensive Focal Loss (ACFL) that dynamically adjusts class weights and focusing factors to curb head over-fitting and reduce popularity bias; (ii) Prototype Learning for Long-Tail Recommendation, which selects semantic, affective, and contextual prototypes to guide clustering and stabilize body and tail representations; and (iii) a GPT-4o-driven prototype-guided dialogue augmentation module that automatically generates diverse long-tail conversational snippets to alleviate tail sparsity and distribution shift. Together, these strategies enable LumiCRS to markedly improve recommendation accuracy, diversity, and fairness: on the REDIAL and INSPIRED benchmarks, LumiCRS boosts Recall@10 and Tail-Recall@10 by 7-15% over fifteen strong baselines, while human evaluations confirm superior fluency, informativeness, and long-tail relevance. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-layer collaboration in building an efficient and fair long-tail conversational recommender.

<title>ChipSeek-R1: Generating Human-Surpassing RTL with LLM via Hierarchical Reward-Driven Reinforcement Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04736</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04736</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.04736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential for automating Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation. However, current approaches face a critical challenge: they can not simultaneously optimize for functional correctness and hardware quality (Power, Performance, Area - PPA). Methods based on supervised fine-tuning often generate functionally correct but PPA-suboptimal code, lacking mechanisms to learn optimization principles. In contrast, post-processing techniques that attempt to improve PPA metrics after generation are often inefficient because they operate externally without updating the LLM's parameters, thus failing to enhance the model's intrinsic design capabilities.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce ChipSeek-R1, a hierarchical reward-driven reinforcement learning framework to train LLMs to generate RTL code that achieves both functional correctness and optimized PPA metrics. ChipSeek-R1 employs a hierarchical reward system, which incorporates direct feedback on syntax, functional correctness (from simulators) and PPA metrics (from synthesis tools) during reinforcement learning. This enables the model to learn complex hardware design trade-offs via trial-and-error, generating RTL code that is both functionally correct and PPA-optimized. Evaluating ChipSeek-R1 on standard benchmarks (VerilogEval, RTLLM), we achieve state-of-the-art results in functional correctness. Notably, on the RTLLM benchmark, ChipSeek-R1 generated 27 RTL designs surpassing the PPA metrics of the original human-written code. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating toolchain feedback into LLM training and highlight the potential for reinforcement learning to enable automated generation of human-surpassing RTL code. We open-source our code in anonymous github.

<title>Activation Steering for Chain-of-Thought Compression</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning when they include intermediate steps, known as "chains of thought" (CoTs). However, these rationales are often overly verbose, even for simple problems, leading to wasted context, increased latency, and higher energy consumption. We observe that verbose, English-heavy CoTs and concise, math-centric CoTs occupy distinct regions in the model's residual-stream activation space. By extracting and injecting a "steering vector" to transition between these modes, we can reliably shift generation toward more concise reasoning, effectively compressing CoTs without retraining. We formalize this approach as Activation-Steered Compression (ASC), an inference-time technique that shortens reasoning traces by directly modifying hidden representations. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the impact of ASC on the output distribution, derived from a closed-form KL-divergence-bounded constraint to regulate steering strength. Using only 100 paired verbose and concise examples, ASC achieves up to 67.43% reduction in CoT length on MATH500 and GSM8K datasets, while maintaining accuracy across 7B, 8B, and 32B parameter models. As a training-free method, ASC introduces negligible runtime overhead and, on MATH500, delivers an average 2.73x speedup in end-to-end reasoning wall-clock time on an 8B model. This makes ASC a practical and efficient tool for streamlining the deployment of reasoning-capable LLMs in latency- or cost-sensitive settings. The code is available at: https://github.com/ArminAzizi98/ASC

Abstract: Question-answering (QA) interfaces powered by large language models (LLMs) present a promising direction for improving interactivity with HVAC system insights, particularly for non-expert users. However, enabling accurate, real-time, and context-aware interactions with HVAC systems introduces unique challenges, including the integration of frequently updated sensor data, domain-specific knowledge grounding, and coherent multi-stage reasoning. In this paper, we present JARVIS, a two-stage LLM-based QA framework tailored for sensor data-driven HVAC system interaction. JARVIS employs an Expert-LLM to translate high-level user queries into structured execution instructions, and an Agent that performs SQL-based data retrieval, statistical processing, and final response generation. To address HVAC-specific challenges, JARVIS integrates (1) an adaptive context injection strategy for efficient HVAC and deployment-specific information integration, (2) a parameterized SQL builder and executor to improve data access reliability, and (3) a bottom-up planning scheme to ensure consistency across multi-stage response generation. We evaluate JARVIS using real-world data collected from a commercial HVAC system and a ground truth QA dataset curated by HVAC experts to demonstrate its effectiveness in delivering accurate and interpretable responses across diverse queries. Results show that JARVIS consistently outperforms baseline and ablation variants in both automated and user-centered assessments, achieving high response quality and accuracy.

Abstract: Furniture decoration is an important task in various industrial applications. However, achieving a high-quality decorative result is often time-consuming and requires specialized artistic expertise. To tackle these challenges, we explore how multi-agent systems can assist in automating the decoration process. We propose FurniMAS, a multi-agent system for automatic furniture decoration. Specifically, given a human prompt and a household furniture item such as a working desk or a TV stand, our system suggests relevant assets with appropriate styles and materials, and arranges them on the item, ensuring the decorative result meets functionality, aesthetic, and ambiance preferences. FurniMAS assembles a hybrid team of LLM-based and non-LLM agents, each fulfilling distinct roles in a typical decoration project. These agents collaborate through communication, logical reasoning, and validation to transform the requirements into the final outcome. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FurniMAS significantly outperforms other baselines in generating high-quality 3D decor.

<title>Application and Evaluation of Large Language Models for Forecasting the Impact of Traffic Incidents</title>

Abstract: This study examines the feasibility of applying large language models (LLMs) for forecasting the impact of traffic incidents on the traffic flow. The use of LLMs for this task has several advantages over existing machine learning-based solutions such as not requiring a large training dataset and the ability to utilize free-text incident logs. We propose a fully LLM-based solution that predicts the incident impact using a combination of traffic features and LLM-extracted incident features. A key ingredient of this solution is an effective method of selecting examples for the LLM's in-context learning. We evaluate the performance of three advanced LLMs and two state-of-the-art machine learning models on a real traffic incident dataset. The results show that the best-performing LLM matches the accuracy of the most accurate machine learning model, despite the former not having been trained on this prediction task. The findings indicate that LLMs are a practically viable option for traffic incident impact prediction.

Abstract: Enhancing interrogation capabilities in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) diagnosis through multi-turn dialogues and knowledge graphs presents a significant challenge for modern AI systems. Current large language models (LLMs), despite their advancements, exhibit notable limitations in medical applications, particularly in conducting effective multi-turn dialogues and proactive questioning. These shortcomings hinder their practical application and effectiveness in simulating real-world diagnostic scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose DoPI, a novel LLM system specifically designed for the TCM domain. The DoPI system introduces a collaborative architecture comprising a guidance model and an expert model. The guidance model conducts multi-turn dialogues with patients and dynamically generates questions based on a knowledge graph to efficiently extract critical symptom information. Simultaneously, the expert model leverages deep TCM expertise to provide final diagnoses and treatment plans. Furthermore, this study constructs a multi-turn doctor-patient dialogue dataset to simulate realistic consultation scenarios and proposes a novel evaluation methodology that does not rely on manually collected real-world consultation data. Experimental results show that the DoPI system achieves an accuracy rate of 84.68 percent in interrogation outcomes, significantly enhancing the model's communication ability during diagnosis while maintaining professional expertise.

<title>MARBLE: A Multi-Agent Rule-Based LLM Reasoning Engine for Accident Severity Prediction</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04893</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04893</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.04893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accident severity prediction plays a critical role in transportation safety systems but is a persistently difficult task due to incomplete data, strong feature dependencies, and severe class imbalance in which rare but high-severity cases are underrepresented and hard to detect. Existing methods often rely on monolithic models or black box prompting, which struggle to scale in noisy, real-world settings and offer limited interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose MARBLE a multiagent rule based LLM engine that decomposes the severity prediction task across a team of specialized reasoning agents, including an interchangeable ML-backed agent. Each agent focuses on a semantic subset of features (e.g., spatial, environmental, temporal), enabling scoped reasoning and modular prompting without the risk of prompt saturation. Predictions are coordinated through either rule-based or LLM-guided consensus mechanisms that account for class rarity and confidence dynamics. The system retains structured traces of agent-level reasoning and coordination outcomes, supporting in-depth interpretability and post-hoc performance diagnostics. Across both UK and US datasets, MARBLE consistently outperforms traditional machine learning classifiers and state-of-the-art (SOTA) prompt-based reasoning methods including Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Least-to-Most (L2M), and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) achieving nearly 90% accuracy where others plateau below 48%. This performance redefines the practical ceiling for accident severity classification under real world noise and extreme class imbalance. Our results position MARBLE as a generalizable and interpretable framework for reasoning under uncertainty in safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Surgical action planning requires predicting future instrument-verb-target triplets for real-time assistance. While teleoperated robotic surgery provides natural expert demonstrations for imitation learning (IL), reinforcement learning (RL) could potentially discover superior strategies through exploration. We present the first comprehensive comparison of IL versus RL for surgical action planning on CholecT50. Our Dual-task Autoregressive Imitation Learning (DARIL) baseline achieves 34.6% action triplet recognition mAP and 33.6% next frame prediction mAP with smooth planning degradation to 29.2% at 10-second horizons. We evaluated three RL variants: world model-based RL, direct video RL, and inverse RL enhancement. Surprisingly, all RL approaches underperformed DARIL i.e. world model RL dropped to 3.1% mAP at 10s while direct video RL achieved only 15.9%. Our analysis reveals that distribution matching on expert-annotated test sets systematically favors IL over potentially valid RL policies that differ from training demonstrations. This challenges assumptions about RL superiority in sequential decision making and provides crucial insights for surgical AI development.

Abstract: Pearl observes that causal knowledge enables predicting the effects of interventions, such as actions, whereas descriptive knowledge only permits drawing conclusions from observation. This paper extends Pearl's approach to causality and interventions to the setting of stratified abductive logic programs. It shows how stable models of such programs can be given a causal interpretation by building on philosophical foundations and recent work by Bochman and Eelink et al. In particular, it provides a translation of abductive logic programs into causal systems, thereby clarifying the informal causal reading of logic program rules and supporting principled reasoning about external actions. The main result establishes that the stable model semantics for stratified programs conforms to key philosophical principles of causation, such as causal sufficiency, natural necessity, and irrelevance of unobserved effects. This justifies the use of stratified abductive logic programs as a framework for causal modeling and for predicting the effects of interventions

<title>Rule Learning for Knowledge Graph Reasoning under Agnostic Distribution Shift</title>

arXiv:2507.05110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge graph (KG) reasoning remains a critical research area focused on inferring missing knowledge by analyzing relationships among observed facts. Despite its success, a key limitation of existing KG reasoning methods is their dependence on the I.I.D assumption. This assumption can easily be violated due to unknown sample selection bias during training or agnostic distribution shifts during testing, significantly compromising model performance and reliability. To facilitate the deployment of KG reasoning in wild environments, this study investigates learning logical rules from KGs affected by unknown selection bias. Additionally, we address test sets with agnostic distribution shifts, formally defining this challenge as out-of-distribution (OOD) KG reasoning-a previously underexplored problem. To solve the issue, we propose the Stable Rule Learning (StableRule) framework, an end-to-end methodology that integrates feature decorrelation with rule learning network, to enhance OOD generalization performance. By leveraging feature decorrelation, the StableRule framework mitigates the adverse effects of covariate shifts arising in OOD scenarios, thereby improving the robustness of the rule learning component in effectively deriving logical rules. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark KGs demonstrate the framework's superior effectiveness and stability across diverse heterogeneous environments, underscoring its practical significance for real-world applications.

Abstract: Cross-domain Click-Through Rate prediction aims to tackle the data sparsity and the cold start problems in online advertising systems by transferring knowledge from source domains to a target domain. Most existing methods rely on overlapping users to facilitate this transfer, often focusing on joint training or pre-training with fine-tuning approach to connect the source and target domains. However, in real-world industrial settings, joint training struggles to learn optimal representations with different distributions, and pre-training with fine-tuning is not well-suited for continuously integrating new data. To address these issues, we propose GIST, a cross-domain lifelong sequence model that decouples the training processes of the source and target domains. Unlike previous methods that search lifelong sequences in the source domains using only content or behavior signals or their simple combinations, we innovatively introduce a Content-Behavior Joint Training Module (CBJT), which aligns content-behavior distributions and combines them with guided information to facilitate a more stable representation. Furthermore, we develop an Asymmetric Similarity Integration strategy (ASI) to augment knowledge transfer through similarity computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GIST, surpassing SOTA methods on offline evaluations and an online A/B test. Deployed on the Xiaohongshu (RedNote) platform, GIST effectively enhances online ads system performance at scale, serving hundreds of millions of daily active users.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has significant potential in healthcare applications, but its training and deployment faces challenges due to healthcare's diverse data, complex tasks, and the need to preserve privacy. Foundation models that perform well on medical tasks and require less task-specific tuning data are critical to accelerate the development of healthcare AI applications. We introduce MedGemma, a collection of medical vision-language foundation models based on Gemma 3 4B and 27B. MedGemma demonstrates advanced medical understanding and reasoning on images and text, significantly exceeding the performance of similar-sized generative models and approaching the performance of task-specific models, while maintaining the general capabilities of the Gemma 3 base models. For out-of-distribution tasks, MedGemma achieves 2.6-10% improvement on medical multimodal question answering, 15.5-18.1% improvement on chest X-ray finding classification, and 10.8% improvement on agentic evaluations compared to the base models. Fine-tuning MedGemma further improves performance in subdomains, reducing errors in electronic health record information retrieval by 50% and reaching comparable performance to existing specialized state-of-the-art methods for pneumothorax classification and histopathology patch classification. We additionally introduce MedSigLIP, a medically-tuned vision encoder derived from SigLIP. MedSigLIP powers the visual understanding capabilities of MedGemma and as an encoder achieves comparable or better performance than specialized medical image encoders. Taken together, the MedGemma collection provides a strong foundation of medical image and text capabilities, with potential to significantly accelerate medical research and development of downstream applications. The MedGemma collection, including tutorials and model weights, can be found at https://goo.gle/medgemma.

Abstract: The rapid advancements of AI agents have ignited the long-held ambition of leveraging them to accelerate scientific discovery. Achieving this goal requires a deep understanding of the frontiers of human knowledge. As such, Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) provides an exceptionally challenging touchstone for evaluating scientific AI agents. In this work, we aim to construct the foundational architecture for general-purpose agents and validate the capabilities through leading performance on HLE. To achieve this, we introduce X-Master, a tool-augmented reasoning agent designed to emulate human researchers by interacting flexibly with external tools during its reasoning process. This agent, guided by the conceptualization of code as an interaction language, can flexibly leverage built-in Python libraries and our customized tools to augment the reasoning. We further scale its capabilities through X-Masters, a scattered-and-stacked agentic workflow that systematically enhances breadth and depth of reasoning. Our open-source solution, X-Masters, sets a new state-of-the-art record on HLE with a score of 32.1%, surpassing OpenAI's and Google's Deep Research (26.6% and 26.9%) and becoming the first to exceed the 30% threshold. This work allows us to gain a deeper understanding of complex task-solving and accumulates valuable experience that can inform future advancements, guiding subsequent model training.

Abstract: In collaborative tasks, being able to adapt to your teammates is a necessary requirement for success. When teammates are heterogeneous, such as in human-agent teams, agents need to be able to observe, recognize, and adapt to their human partners in real time. This becomes particularly challenging in tasks with time pressure and complex strategic spaces where the dynamics can change rapidly. In this work, we introduce TALENTS, a strategy-conditioned cooperator framework that learns to represent, categorize, and adapt to a range of partner strategies, enabling ad-hoc teamwork. Our approach utilizes a variational autoencoder to learn a latent strategy space from trajectory data. This latent space represents the underlying strategies that agents employ. Subsequently, the system identifies different types of strategy by clustering the data. Finally, a cooperator agent is trained to generate partners for each type of strategy, conditioned on these clusters. In order to adapt to previously unseen partners, we leverage a fixed-share regret minimization algorithm that infers and adjusts the estimated partner strategy dynamically. We assess our approach in a customized version of the Overcooked environment, posing a challenging cooperative cooking task that demands strong coordination across a wide range of possible strategies. Using an online user study, we show that our agent outperforms current baselines when working with unfamiliar human partners.

<title>When Chain of Thought is Necessary, Language Models Struggle to Evade Monitors</title>

Abstract: While chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring is an appealing AI safety defense, recent work on "unfaithfulness" has cast doubt on its reliability. These findings highlight an important failure mode, particularly when CoT acts as a post-hoc rationalization in applications like auditing for bias. However, for the distinct problem of runtime monitoring to prevent severe harm, we argue the key property is not faithfulness but monitorability. To this end, we introduce a conceptual framework distinguishing CoT-as-rationalization from CoT-as-computation. We expect that certain classes of severe harm will require complex, multi-step reasoning that necessitates CoT-as-computation. Replicating the experimental setups of prior work, we increase the difficulty of the bad behavior to enforce this necessity condition; this forces the model to expose its reasoning, making it monitorable. We then present methodology guidelines to stress-test CoT monitoring against deliberate evasion. Applying these guidelines, we find that models can learn to obscure their intentions, but only when given significant help, such as detailed human-written strategies or iterative optimization against the monitor. We conclude that, while not infallible, CoT monitoring offers a substantial layer of defense that requires active protection and continued stress-testing.

Abstract: This study explores how Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning, guided by human aesthetic evaluations, can enhance the outputs of generative AI models in tangible product design, using lamp design as a case study. By integrating human feedback into the AI model, we aim to improve both the desirability and aesthetic appeal of the generated designs. Comprehensive experiments were conducted, starting with prompt optimization techniques and focusing on LoRA fine-tuning of the Stable Diffusion model. Additionally, methods to convert AI-generated designs into tangible products through 3D realization using 3D printing technologies were investigated. The results indicate that LoRA fine-tuning effectively aligns AI-generated designs with human aesthetic preferences, leading to significant improvements in desirability and aesthetic appeal scores. These findings highlight the potential of human-AI collaboration in tangible product design and provide valuable insights into integrating human feedback into AI design processes.

Abstract: The high computational cost and power consumption of current and anticipated AI systems present a major challenge for widespread deployment and further scaling. Current hardware approaches face fundamental efficiency limits. This paper introduces ZettaLith, a scalable computing architecture designed to reduce the cost and power of AI inference by over 1,000x compared to current GPU-based systems. Based on architectural analysis and technology projections, a single ZettaLith rack could potentially achieve 1.507 zettaFLOPS in 2027 - representing a theoretical 1,047x improvement in inference performance, 1,490x better power efficiency, and could be 2,325x more cost-effective than current leading GPU racks for FP4 transformer inference. The ZettaLith architecture achieves these gains by abandoning general purpose GPU applications, and via the multiplicative effect of numerous co-designed architectural innovations using established digital electronic technologies, as detailed in this paper. ZettaLith's core architectural principles scale down efficiently to exaFLOPS desktop systems and petaFLOPS mobile chips, maintaining their roughly 1,000x advantage. ZettaLith presents a simpler system architecture compared to the complex hierarchy of current GPU clusters. ZettaLith is optimized exclusively for AI inference and is not applicable for AI training.

<title>Lightweight LSTM Model for Energy Theft Detection via Input Data Reduction</title>

Abstract: With the increasing integration of smart meters in electrical grids worldwide, detecting energy theft has become a critical and ongoing challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based models have demonstrated strong performance in identifying fraudulent consumption patterns; however, previous works exploring the use of machine learning solutions for this problem demand high computational and energy costs, limiting their practicality -- particularly in low-theft scenarios where continuous inference can result in unnecessary energy usage. This paper proposes a lightweight detection unit, or watchdog mechanism, designed to act as a pre-filter that determines when to activate a long short-term memory (LSTM) model. This mechanism reduces the volume of input fed to the LSTM model, limiting it to instances that are more likely to involve energy theft thereby preserving detection accuracy while substantially reducing energy consumption associated with continuous model execution. The proposed system was evaluated through simulations across six scenarios with varying theft severity and number of active thieves. Results indicate a power consumption reduction exceeding 64\%, with minimal loss in detection accuracy and consistently high recall. These findings support the feasibility of a more energy-efficient and scalable approach to energy theft detection in smart grids. In contrast to prior work that increases model complexity to achieve marginal accuracy gains, this study emphasizes practical deployment considerations such as inference efficiency and system scalability. The results highlight the potential for deploying sustainable, AI-assisted monitoring systems within modern smart grid infrastructures.

Abstract: The philosophy of mathematical practice (PMP) looks to evidence from working mathematics to help settle philosophical questions. One prominent program under the PMP banner is the study of explanation in mathematics, which aims to understand what sorts of proofs mathematicians consider explanatory and what role the pursuit of explanation plays in mathematical practice. In an effort to address worries about cherry-picked examples and file-drawer problems in PMP, a handful of authors have recently turned to corpus analysis methods as a promising alternative to small-scale case studies. This paper reports the results from such a corpus study facilitated by Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro, a model whose reasoning capabilities, advances in hallucination control and large context window allow for the accurate analysis of hundreds of pages of text per query. Based on a sample of 5000 mathematics papers from arXiv.org, the experiments yielded a dataset of hundreds of useful annotated examples. Its aim was to gain insight on questions like the following: How often do mathematicians make claims about explanation in the relevant sense? Do mathematicians' explanatory practices vary in any noticeable way by subject matter? Which philosophical theories of explanation are most consistent with a large body of non-cherry-picked examples? How might philosophers make further use of AI tools to gain insights from large datasets of this kind? As the first PMP study making extensive use of LLM methods, it also seeks to begin a conversation about these methods as research tools in practice-oriented philosophy and to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of current models for such work.

Abstract: Circular genome visualizations are essential for exploring structural variants and gene regulation. However, existing tools often require complex scripting and manual configuration, making the process time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to learn. To address these challenges, we introduce AuraGenome, an LLM-powered framework for rapid, reusable, and scalable generation of multi-layered circular genome visualizations. AuraGenome combines a semantic-driven multi-agent workflow with an interactive visual analytics system. The workflow employs seven specialized LLM-driven agents, each assigned distinct roles such as intent recognition, layout planning, and code generation, to transform raw genomic data into tailored visualizations. The system supports multiple coordinated views tailored for genomic data, offering ring, radial, and chord-based layouts to represent multi-layered circular genome visualizations. In addition to enabling interactions and configuration reuse, the system supports real-time refinement and high-quality report export. We validate its effectiveness through two case studies and a comprehensive user study. AuraGenome is available at: https://github.com/Darius18/AuraGenome.

Abstract: Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) are a key tool for addressing costly optimization tasks, with their efficiency being heavily dependent on the selection of surrogate models and infill sampling criteria. However, designing an effective dynamic selection strategy for SAEAs is labor-intensive and requires substantial domain knowledge. To address this challenge, this paper proposes LLM-SAEA, a novel approach that integrates large language models (LLMs) to configure both surrogate models and infill sampling criteria online. Specifically, LLM-SAEA develops a collaboration-of-experts framework, where one LLM serves as a scoring expert (LLM-SE), assigning scores to surrogate models and infill sampling criteria based on their optimization performance, while another LLM acts as a decision expert (LLM-DE), selecting the appropriate configurations by analyzing their scores along with the current optimization state. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-SAEA outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms across standard test cases.

Abstract: This paper discusses how particle swarm optimization (PSO) can be used to generate quantum circuits to solve an instance of the MaxOne problem. It then analyzes previous studies on evolutionary algorithms for circuit synthesis. With a brief introduction to PSO, including its parameters and algorithm flow, the paper focuses on a method of quantum circuit encoding and representation as PSO parameters. The fitness evaluation used in this paper is the MaxOne problem. The paper presents experimental results that compare different learning abilities and inertia weight variations in the PSO algorithm. A comparison is further made between the PSO algorithm and a genetic algorithm for quantum circuit synthesis. The results suggest PSO converges more quickly to the optimal solution.

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recent years has also given rise to the development of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). These new MLLMs allow us to process images, videos and even audio alongside textual inputs. In this project, we aim to assess the effectiveness of MLLMs in analysing sports videos, focusing mainly on tennis videos. Despite research done on tennis analysis, there remains a gap in models that are able to understand and identify the sequence of events in a tennis rally, which would be useful in other fields of sports analytics. As such, we will mainly assess the MLLMs on their ability to fill this gap - to classify tennis actions, as well as their ability to identify these actions in a sequence of tennis actions in a rally. We further looked into ways we can improve the MLLMs' performance, including different training methods and even using them together with other traditional models.

<title>Preference-Optimal Multi-Metric Weighting for Parallel Coordinate Plots</title>

Abstract: Parallel coordinate plots (PCPs) are a prevalent method to interpret the relationship between the control parameters and metrics. PCPs deliver such an interpretation by color gradation based on a single metric. However, it is challenging to provide such a gradation when multiple metrics are present. Although a naive approach involves calculating a single metric by linearly weighting each metric, such weighting is unclear for users. To address this problem, we first propose a principled formulation for calculating the optimal weight based on a specific preferred metric combination. Although users can simply select their preference from a two-dimensional (2D) plane for bi-metric problems, multi-metric problems require intuitive visualization to allow them to select their preference. We achieved this using various radar charts to visualize the metric trade-offs on the 2D plane reduced by UMAP. In the analysis using pedestrian flow guidance planning, our method identified unique patterns of control parameter importance for each user preference, highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

<title>Hyperbolic Kernel Graph Neural Networks for Neurocognitive Decline Analysis from Multimodal Brain Imaging</title>

Abstract: Multimodal neuroimages, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), offer complementary perspectives on brain activities by capturing structural or functional interactions among brain regions. While existing studies suggest that fusing these multimodal data helps detect abnormal brain activity caused by neurocognitive decline, they are generally implemented in Euclidean space and can't effectively capture intrinsic hierarchical organization of structural/functional brain networks. This paper presents a hyperbolic kernel graph fusion (HKGF) framework for neurocognitive decline analysis with multimodal neuroimages. It consists of a multimodal graph construction module, a graph representation learning module that encodes brain graphs in hyperbolic space through a family of hyperbolic kernel graph neural networks (HKGNNs), a cross-modality coupling module that enables effective multimodal data fusion, and a hyperbolic neural network for downstream predictions. Notably, HKGNNs represent graphs in hyperbolic space to capture both local and global dependencies among brain regions while preserving the hierarchical structure of brain networks. Extensive experiments involving over 4,000 subjects with DTI and/or fMRI data suggest the superiority of HKGF over state-of-the-art methods in two neurocognitive decline prediction tasks. HKGF is a general framework for multimodal data analysis, facilitating objective quantification of structural/functional brain connectivity changes associated with neurocognitive decline.

Abstract: Designing effective task sequences is crucial for curriculum reinforcement learning (CRL), where agents must gradually acquire skills by training on intermediate tasks. A key challenge in CRL is to identify tasks that promote exploration, yet are similar enough to support effective transfer. While recent approach suggests comparing tasks via their Structural Causal Models (SCMs), the method requires access to ground-truth causal structures, an unrealistic assumption in most RL settings. In this work, we propose Causal-Paced Deep Reinforcement Learning (CP-DRL), a curriculum learning framework aware of SCM differences between tasks based on interaction data approximation. This signal captures task novelty, which we combine with the agent's learnability, measured by reward gain, to form a unified objective. Empirically, CP-DRL outperforms existing curriculum methods on the Point Mass benchmark, achieving faster convergence and higher returns. CP-DRL demonstrates reduced variance with comparable final returns in the Bipedal Walker-Trivial setting, and achieves the highest average performance in the Infeasible variant. These results indicate that leveraging causal relationships between tasks can improve the structure-awareness and sample efficiency of curriculum reinforcement learning. We provide the full implementation of CP-DRL to facilitate the reproduction of our main results at https://github.com/Cho-Geonwoo/CP-DRL.

Abstract: We introduce DiceHuBERT, a knowledge distillation framework for compressing HuBERT, a widely used self-supervised learning (SSL)-based speech foundation model. Unlike existing distillation methods that rely on layer-wise and feature-wise mapping between teacher and student models, DiceHuBERT leverages HuBERT's iterative self-distillation mechanism by directly replacing the original model with a student model. This replacement allows the student to be trained using the same SSL objective used when pre-training HuBERT, eliminating the need for additional modules or architectural constraints. Experimental results on SUPERB show that DiceHuBERT consistently outperforms existing distillation methods, improving phoneme recognition performance by over 21% and ASR performance by more than 14%. Furthermore, DiceHuBERT demonstrates competitive performance across multiple tasks, highlighting its clear advantage.

Abstract: This study proposes an analytical framework that integrates DBSCAN clustering with the Elastic Net regression model to address multifactorial problems characterized by structural complexity and multicollinearity, exemplified by carbon emissions analysis. DBSCAN is employed for unsupervised learning to objectively cluster features, while the Elastic Net is utilized for high-dimensional feature selection and complexity control. The Elastic Net is specifically chosen for its ability to balance feature selection and regularization by combining L1 (lasso) and L2 (ridge) penalties, making it particularly suited for datasets with correlated predictors. Applying this framework to energy consumption data from 46 industries in China (2000-2019) resulted in the identification of 16 categories. Emission characteristics and drivers were quantitatively assessed for each category, demonstrating the framework's capacity to identify primary emission sources and provide actionable insights. This research underscores the global applicability of the framework for analyzing complex regional challenges, such as carbon emissions, and highlights qualitative features that humans find meaningful may not be accurate for the model.

We demonstrate that these features improve predictive accuracy and validate the value of further research into cyclic modelling techniques for SRL.

Abstract: Building on the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) paradigm, a recent self-supervised learning framework that predicts latent representations of masked regions in high-level feature spaces, we propose Audio-JEPA (Audio Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture), tailored specifically for audio data. Audio-JEPA uses a simple Vision Transformer backbone to predict latent representations of masked spectrogram patches rather than reconstructing raw audio. We pre-train on unlabeled AudioSet clips (10s, 32kHz) with random patch masking on mel-spectrograms. We evaluate on the X-ARES suite covering speech, music, and environmental sound tasks. Although our implementation is a straightforward translation of the original model to audio, the results still show comparable performance to wav2vec 2.0 and data2vec while using less than one-fifth of their training data and with no hyper-parameter tuning. All code and pretrained checkpoints will be released on GitHub.

<title>Efficient Certified Reasoning for Binarized Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as essential components in safety-critical applications -- these use cases demand complex, yet trustworthy computations. Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) are a type of neural network where each neuron is constrained to a Boolean value; they are particularly well-suited for safety-critical tasks because they retain much of the computational capacities of full-scale (floating-point or quantized) deep neural networks, but remain compatible with satisfiability solvers for qualitative verification and with model counters for quantitative reasoning. However, existing methods for BNN analysis suffer from either limited scalability or susceptibility to soundness errors, which hinders their applicability in real-world scenarios.
  In this work, we present a scalable and trustworthy approach for both qualitative and quantitative verification of BNNs. Our approach introduces a native representation of BNN constraints in a custom-designed solver for qualitative reasoning, and in an approximate model counter for quantitative reasoning. We further develop specialized proof generation and checking pipelines with native support for BNN constraint reasoning, ensuring trustworthiness for all of our verification results. Empirical evaluations on a BNN robustness verification benchmark suite demonstrate that our certified solving approach achieves a $9\times$ speedup over prior certified CNF and PB-based approaches, and our certified counting approach achieves a $218\times$ speedup over the existing CNF-based baseline. In terms of coverage, our pipeline produces fully certified results for $99\%$ and $86\%$ of the qualitative and quantitative reasoning queries on BNNs, respectively. This is in sharp contrast to the best existing baselines which can fully certify only $62\%$ and $4\%$ of the queries, respectively.

Abstract: While Large Language Models and their underlying Transformer architecture are remarkably efficient, they do not reflect how our brain processes and learns a diversity of cognitive tasks such as language and working memory. Furthermore, sequential data processing with Transformers encounters a fundamental barrier: quadratic complexity growth with sequence length. Motivated by these limitations, our ambition is to create more efficient models that are less reliant on intensive computations and massive volumes of data. We introduce Echo State Transformers (EST), a hybrid architecture that elegantly resolves this challenge while demonstrating exceptional performance in low-data regimes. EST integrates the Transformer attention mechanisms with principles from Reservoir Computing to create a fixedsize window distributed memory system. Drawing inspiration from Echo State Networks, the most prominent instance of the Reservoir Computing paradigm, our architecture integrates a new module called ''Working Memory'' based on several reservoirs (i.e. random recurrent networks) working in parallel. These reservoirs work as independent memory units with distinct internal dynamics. A novelty here is that the classical reservoir hyperparameters controlling the dynamics are now trained. Thus, the EST dynamically adapts the memory/non-linearity trade-off in reservoirs. By maintaining a fixed number of memory units regardless of sequence length, EST achieves constant computational complexity at each processing step, effectively breaking the quadratic scaling problem of standard Transformers. Evaluations on the STREAM benchmark, which comprises 12 diverse sequential processing tasks, demonstrate that EST outperforms GRUs, LSTMs, and even Transformers on 8 of these tasks. These findings highlight that Echo State Transformers can be an effective replacement to GRUs and LSTMs while complementing standard Transformers at least on resource-constrained environments and low-data scenarios across diverse sequential processing tasks.

Abstract: Healthcare professionals need effective ways to use, understand, and validate AI-driven clinical decision support systems. Existing systems face two key limitations: complex visualizations and a lack of grounding in scientific evidence. We present an integrated decision support system that combines interactive visualizations with a conversational agent to explain diabetes risk assessments. We propose a hybrid prompt handling approach combining fine-tuned language models for analytical queries with general Large Language Models (LLMs) for broader medical questions, a methodology for grounding AI explanations in scientific evidence, and a feature range analysis technique to support deeper understanding of feature contributions. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 30 healthcare professionals and found that the conversational interactions helped healthcare professionals build a clear understanding of model assessments, while the integration of scientific evidence calibrated trust in the system's decisions. Most participants reported that the system supported both patient risk evaluation and recommendation.

Abstract: Spatial structure is central to effective geospatial intelligence systems. While foundation models have shown promise, they often lack the flexibility to reason about places, which are context-rich regions spanning different spatial granularities. We propose PlaceFM, a spatial foundation model that captures place representations using a training-free graph condensation method. PlaceFM condenses a nationwide POI graph built from integrated Foursquare and OpenStreetMap data in the U.S., generating general-purpose embeddings of places. These embeddings can be seamlessly integrated into geolocation data pipelines to support a wide range of downstream tasks. Without requiring pretraining, PlaceFM offers a scalable and adaptable solution for multi-scale geospatial analysis.

<title>A Unified Speech LLM for Diarization and Speech Recognition in Multilingual Conversations</title>

Abstract: Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs) have emerged as a crucial paradigm in recent years, extending the capabilities of traditional LLMs to speech tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and spoken dialogue modeling. However, their effectiveness in real-world multilingual conversations remains limited by the scarcity of data that captures natural conversational phenomena. To address this, the MLC-SLM Challenge provides a multilingual conversational dataset and evaluates models on two tasks: ASR with oracle segmentation (Task I) and joint diarization and recognition without oracle information (Task II). In this paper, we focus on Task II and propose a unified speech LLM that jointly performs diarization and ASR in an end-to-end manner. By reformulating the training data format and modifying the inference procedure, our model addresses the ambiguity inherent in pre-segmented audio and achieves a 54.87\% relative improvement in tcpWER/tcpCER over the baseline, ranking 8th overall, despite using a smaller LLM backbone. We also report results from Task I using a fine-tuned speech LLM.

Abstract: Hidden confounding remains a central challenge in estimating treatment effects from observational data, as unobserved variables can lead to biased causal estimates. While recent work has explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for causal inference, most approaches still rely on the unconfoundedness assumption. In this paper, we make the first attempt to mitigate hidden confounding using LLMs. We propose ProCI (Progressive Confounder Imputation), a framework that elicits the semantic and world knowledge of LLMs to iteratively generate, impute, and validate hidden confounders. ProCI leverages two key capabilities of LLMs: their strong semantic reasoning ability, which enables the discovery of plausible confounders from both structured and unstructured inputs, and their embedded world knowledge, which supports counterfactual reasoning under latent confounding. To improve robustness, ProCI adopts a distributional reasoning strategy instead of direct value imputation to prevent the collapsed outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ProCI uncovers meaningful confounders and significantly improves treatment effect estimation across various datasets and LLMs.

Abstract: We present the Object-Based Sub-Environment Recognition (OBSER) framework, a novel Bayesian framework that infers three fundamental relationships between sub-environments and their constituent objects. In the OBSER framework, metric and self-supervised learning models estimate the object distributions of sub-environments on the latent space to compute these measures. Both theoretically and empirically, we validate the proposed framework by introducing the ($\epsilon,\delta$) statistically separable (EDS) function which indicates the alignment of the representation. Our framework reliably performs inference in open-world and photorealistic environments and outperforms scene-based methods in chained retrieval tasks. The OBSER framework enables zero-shot recognition of environments to achieve autonomous environment understanding.

<title>MolProphecy: Bridging Medicinal Chemists' Knowledge and Molecular Pre-Trained Models via a Multi-Modal Framework</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.02932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MolProphecy is a human-in-the-loop (HITL) multi-modal framework designed to integrate chemists' domain knowledge into molecular property prediction models. While molecular pre-trained models have enabled significant gains in predictive accuracy, they often fail to capture the tacit, interpretive reasoning central to expert-driven molecular design. To address this, MolProphecy employs ChatGPT as a virtual chemist to simulate expert-level reasoning and decision-making. The generated chemist knowledge is embedded by the large language model (LLM) as a dedicated knowledge representation and then fused with graph-based molecular features through a gated cross-attention mechanism, enabling joint reasoning over human-derived and structural features. Evaluated on four benchmark datasets (FreeSolv, BACE, SIDER, and ClinTox), MolProphecy outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, achieving a 15.0 percent reduction in RMSE on FreeSolv and a 5.39 percent improvement in AUROC on BACE. Analysis reveals that chemist knowledge and structural features provide complementary contributions, improving both accuracy and interpretability. MolProphecy offers a practical and generalizable approach for collaborative drug discovery, with the flexibility to incorporate real chemist input in place of the current simulated proxy--without the need for model retraining. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/zhangruochi/MolProphecy.

Abstract: This paper explores the possibility of determining the weights and thresholds of a neural network using the potential -- a parameter of an electrostatic field -- without analytical calculations and without applying training algorithms. The work is based on neural network architectures employing metric recognition methods. The electrostatic field is simulated in the Builder C++ environment. In the same environment, a neural network based on metric recognition methods is constructed, with the weights of the first-layer neurons determined by the values of the potentials of the simulated electrostatic field. The effectiveness of the resulting neural network within the simulated system is evaluated using the MNIST test dataset under various initial conditions of the simulated system. The results demonstrated functional viability. The implementation of this approach shows that a neural network can obtain weight values almost instantaneously from the electrostatic field, without the need for analytical computations, lengthy training procedures, or massive training datasets.

Abstract: The Theory of Mind (ToM) refers to an agent's capacity to infer the mental states of other agents. ToM is essential for effective collaboration. To assess ToM in a dynamic, goal-oriented, and collaborative environment, we introduce a novel task, Instruction Inference, in which an agent assists a principal in reaching a goal by interpreting indirect or ambiguous instructions. We present Tomcat, an LLM-based agent, designed to exhibit ToM reasoning in interpreting and responding to the principal's instructions. We implement two variants of Tomcat. One, dubbed Fs-CoT, is based on a small number of examples (i.e., few-shot or Fs) demonstrating the requisite structured reasoning (i.e., chain-of-thought or CoT). One, dubbed CP, relies on commonsense knowledge and information about the problem (i.e., commonsense prompt or CP). We realized both variants of Tomcat on three leading large language models (LLMs), namely, GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and Gemma-3-27B. To evaluate the effectiveness of Tomcat, we conducted a study with 52 human participants in which we provided participants with the same information as the CP variant of Tomcat. We computed intent accuracy, action optimality, and planning optimality to measure the ToM capabilities of Tomcat and our study participants. We found that Tomcat with Fs-CoT, particularly with GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1, achieves performance comparable to the human participants, underscoring its ToM potential for human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Recent results show that modern Large Language Models (LLM) are indeed capable of understanding and answering questions about structured data such as graphs. This new paradigm can lead to solutions that require less supervision while, at the same time, providing a model that can generalize and answer questions beyond the training labels. Existing proposals often use some description of the graph to create an ``augmented'' prompt fed to the LLM. For a chosen class of graphs, if a well-tailored graph encoder is deployed to play together with a pre-trained LLM, the model can answer graph-related questions well. Existing solutions to graph-based prompts range from graph serialization to graph transformers. In this work, we show that the use of a parameter-free graph encoder based on Fock space representations, a concept borrowed from mathematical physics, is remarkably versatile in this problem setting. The simple construction, inherited directly from the theory with a few small adjustments, can provide rich and informative graph encodings, for a wide range of different graphs. We investigate the use of this idea for prefix-tuned prompts leveraging the capabilities of a pre-trained, frozen LLM. The modifications lead to a model that can answer graph-related questions -- from simple graphs to proteins to hypergraphs -- effectively and with minimal, if any, adjustments to the architecture. Our work significantly simplifies existing solutions and generalizes well to multiple different graph-based structures effortlessly.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across diverse open-domain tasks, yet their application in specialized domains such as civil engineering remains largely unexplored. This paper starts bridging this gap by evaluating and enhancing the reliability and robustness of LLMs in structural analysis of beams. Reliability is assessed through the accuracy of correct outputs under repetitive runs of the same problems, whereas robustness is evaluated via the performance across varying load and boundary conditions. A benchmark dataset, comprising eight beam analysis problems, is created to test the Llama-3.3 70B Instruct model. Results show that, despite a qualitative understanding of structural mechanics, the LLM lacks the quantitative reliability and robustness for engineering applications. To address these limitations, a shift is proposed that reframes the structural analysis as code generation tasks. Accordingly, an LLM-empowered agent is developed that (a) integrates chain-of-thought and few-shot prompting to generate accurate OpeeSeesPy code, and (b) automatically executes the code to produce structural analysis results. Experimental results demonstrate that the agent achieves accuracy exceeding 99.0% on the benchmark dataset, exhibiting reliable and robust performance across diverse conditions. Ablation studies highlight the complete example and function usage examples as the primary contributors to the agent's enhanced performance.

<title>Frequency-Aligned Knowledge Distillation for Lightweight Spatiotemporal Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting tasks, such as traffic flow, combustion dynamics, and weather forecasting, often require complex models that suffer from low training efficiency and high memory consumption. This paper proposes a lightweight framework, Spectral Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (termed SDKD), which transfers the multi-scale spatiotemporal representations from a complex teacher model to a more efficient lightweight student network. The teacher model follows an encoder-latent evolution-decoder architecture, where its latent evolution module decouples high-frequency details and low-frequency trends using convolution and Transformer (global low-frequency modeler). However, the multi-layer convolution and deconvolution structures result in slow training and high memory usage. To address these issues, we propose a frequency-aligned knowledge distillation strategy, which extracts multi-scale spectral features from the teacher's latent space, including both high and low frequency components, to guide the lightweight student model in capturing both local fine-grained variations and global evolution patterns. Experimental results show that SDKD significantly improves performance, achieving reductions of up to 81.3% in MSE and in MAE 52.3% on the Navier-Stokes equation dataset. The framework effectively captures both high-frequency variations and long-term trends while reducing computational complexity. Our codes are available at https://github.com/itsnotacie/SDKD

<title>Towards a Comparative Framework for Compositional AI Models</title>

Abstract: The DisCoCirc framework for natural language processing allows the construction of compositional models of text, by combining units for individual words together according to the grammatical structure of the text. The compositional nature of a model can give rise to two things: compositional generalisation -- the ability of a model to generalise outside its training distribution by learning compositional rules underpinning the entire data distribution -- and compositional interpretability -- making sense of how the model works by inspecting its modular components in isolation, as well as the processes through which these components are combined. We present these notions in a framework-agnostic way using the language of category theory, and adapt a series of tests for compositional generalisation to this setting.
  Applying this to the DisCoCirc framework, we consider how well a selection of models can learn to compositionally generalise. We compare both quantum circuit based models, as well as classical neural networks, on a dataset derived from one of the bAbI tasks, extended to test a series of aspects of compositionality. Both architectures score within 5% of one another on the productivity and substitutivity tasks, but differ by at least 10% for the systematicity task, and exhibit different trends on the overgeneralisation tasks. Overall, we find the neural models are more prone to overfitting the Train data. Additionally, we demonstrate how to interpret a compositional model on one of the trained models. By considering how the model components interact with one another, we explain how the model behaves.

<title>GameTileNet: A Semantic Dataset for Low-Resolution Game Art in Procedural Content Generation</title>

Abstract: GameTileNet is a dataset designed to provide semantic labels for low-resolution digital game art, advancing procedural content generation (PCG) and related AI research as a vision-language alignment task. Large Language Models (LLMs) and image-generative AI models have enabled indie developers to create visual assets, such as sprites, for game interactions. However, generating visuals that align with game narratives remains challenging due to inconsistent AI outputs, requiring manual adjustments by human artists. The diversity of visual representations in automatically generated game content is also limited because of the imbalance in distributions across styles for training data. GameTileNet addresses this by collecting artist-created game tiles from OpenGameArt.org under Creative Commons licenses and providing semantic annotations to support narrative-driven content generation. The dataset introduces a pipeline for object detection in low-resolution tile-based game art (e.g., 32x32 pixels) and annotates semantics, connectivity, and object classifications. GameTileNet is a valuable resource for improving PCG methods, supporting narrative-rich game content, and establishing a baseline for object detection in low-resolution, non-photorealistic images.
  TL;DR: GameTileNet is a semantic dataset of low-resolution game tiles designed to support narrative-driven procedural content generation through visual-language alignment.

Abstract: Perception-related tasks often arise in autonomous systems operating under partial observability. This work studies the problem of synthesizing optimal policies for complex perception-related objectives in environments modeled by partially observable Markov decision processes. To formally specify such objectives, we introduce \emph{co-safe linear inequality temporal logic} (sc-iLTL), which can define complex tasks that are formed by the logical concatenation of atomic propositions as linear inequalities on the belief space of the POMDPs. Our solution to the control synthesis problem is to transform the \mbox{sc-iLTL} objectives into reachability objectives by constructing the product of the belief MDP and a deterministic finite automaton built from the sc-iLTL objective. To overcome the scalability challenge due to the product, we introduce a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) method that converges in probability to the optimal policy. Finally, a drone-probing case study demonstrates the applicability of our method.

Abstract: While deep spiking neural networks (SNNs) demonstrate superior performance, their deployment on resource-constrained neuromorphic hardware still remains challenging. Network pruning offers a viable solution by reducing both parameters and synaptic operations (SynOps) to facilitate the edge deployment of SNNs, among which search-based pruning methods search for the SNNs structure after pruning. However, existing search-based methods fail to directly use SynOps as the constraint because it will dynamically change in the searching process, resulting in the final searched network violating the expected SynOps target. In this paper, we introduce a novel SNN pruning framework called SPEAR, which leverages reinforcement learning (RL) technique to directly use SynOps as the searching constraint. To avoid the violation of SynOps requirements, we first propose a SynOps prediction mechanism called LRE to accurately predict the final SynOps after search. Observing SynOps cannot be explicitly calculated and added to constrain the action in RL, we propose a novel reward called TAR to stabilize the searching. Extensive experiments show that our SPEAR framework can effectively compress SNN under specific SynOps constraint.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in video understanding tasks. However, they continue to struggle with long-form videos because of an inefficient perception of temporal intervals. Unlike humans, who can dynamically adjust their temporal focus to locate query-relevant moments, current MLLMs often rely on dense, uniform sampling across the video timeline, leading to high memory consumption and a risk of missing crucial information. To address this challenge, we introduce Temporal Search, a training-free framework that enables MLLMs to explore temporal regions for improved long video understanding iteratively. TS is based on a key observation: the model's generation confidence across different temporal intervals is highly correlated with prediction accuracy. TS operates through two main iterative stages. First, the MLLM proposes a temporal interval that is likely to contain task-relevant information. Then, it samples a fixed number of frames from the interval, regardless of length, and feeds them into the model to produce a refined response and confidence score. TS refines the focus of the model by iteratively shifting attention to more fine-grained temporal intervals, improving its understanding of long videos. Additionally, keyframe-level descriptions are collected to facilitate cross-interval perception throughout the video. To further improve efficiency, we introduce TS-BFS, a best-first search strategy over a tree. Each node represents a candidate interval and is expanded via two methods: self-driven proposals and uniform partitioning. Nodes are scored based on confidence and self-evaluation, and the most promising one is selected for continued exploration.

Abstract: Autonomous driving has seen significant progress, driven by extensive real-world data. However, in long-tail scenarios, accurately predicting the safety of the ego vehicle's future motion remains a major challenge due to uncertainties in dynamic environments and limitations in data coverage. In this work, we aim to explore whether it is possible to enhance the motion risk prediction capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLM) by synthesizing high-risk motion data. Specifically, we introduce a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) based motion simulation method to model risks from three aspects: the ego-vehicle, other vehicles, and the environment. This allows us to synthesize plug-and-play, high-risk motion data suitable for VLM training, which we call DriveMRP-10K. Furthermore, we design a VLM-agnostic motion risk estimation framework, named DriveMRP-Agent. This framework incorporates a novel information injection strategy for global context, ego-vehicle perspective, and trajectory projection, enabling VLMs to effectively reason about the spatial relationships between motion waypoints and the environment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by fine-tuning with DriveMRP-10K, our DriveMRP-Agent framework can significantly improve the motion risk prediction performance of multiple VLM baselines, with the accident recognition accuracy soaring from 27.13% to 88.03%. Moreover, when tested via zero-shot evaluation on an in-house real-world high-risk motion dataset, DriveMRP-Agent achieves a significant performance leap, boosting the accuracy from base_model's 29.42% to 68.50%, which showcases the strong generalization capabilities of our method in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of large language model (LLM) performance across three counseling roles in Japanese-language therapeutic contexts. We simultaneously assessed counselor artificial intelligence (AI) systems (GPT-4-turbo with zeroshot prompting or Structured Multi-step Dialogue Prompts (SMDP), Claude-3-Opus-SMDP), client AI simulations, and evaluation AI systems (o3, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, Gemini-2.5-pro). Human experts (n = 15) with extensive counseling experience evaluated AI-generated dialogues using the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) Coding Manual 4.2.1.
  Notably, SMDP implementation significantly enhanced counselor AI performance across all MITI global ratings compared with zeroshot prompting, with no significant differences between GPT-SMDP and Opus-SMDP. Evaluation AIs showed comparable performance to human raters for Cultivating Change Talk but systematically overestimated Softening Sustain Talk and the overall quality metrics. Model-specific biases emerged: Gemini emphasized power-sharing, o3 focused on technical proficiency, and Sonnet prioritized emotional expression. Client AI simulations exhibited a limited emotional range and unnaturally high compliance, indicating the need for enhanced realism.
  These findings establish benchmarks for AI-assisted counseling in non-English contexts and identify critical areas for improvement through advanced prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation, and targeted fine-tuning, with important implications for developing culturally sensitive AI mental health tools.

Abstract: This paper investigates whether Bittensor can be considered the Bitcoin of decentralized Artificial Intelligence by directly comparing its tokenomics, decentralization properties, consensus mechanism, and incentive structure against those of Bitcoin. Leveraging on-chain data from all 64 active Bittensor subnets, we first document considerable concentration in both stake and rewards. We further show that rewards are overwhelmingly driven by stake, highlighting a clear misalignment between quality and compensation. As a remedy, we put forward a series of two-pronged protocol-level interventions. For incentive realignment, our proposed solutions include performance-weighted emission split, composite scoring, and a trust-bonus multiplier. As for mitigating security vulnerability due to stake concentration, we propose and empirically validate stake cap at the 88th percentile, which elevates the median coalition size required for a 51-percent attack and remains robust across daily, weekly, and monthly snapshots.

Abstract: We investigate various strategic locations of shops in shopping malls in a metropolis with the aim of finding the best strategy for final dominance of market share by a company in a competing environment. The problem is posed in the context of two competing supermarket chains in a metropolis, described in the framework of the two-dimensional Ising model. Evolutionary Algorithm is used to encode the ensemble of initial configurations and Monte Carlo method is used to evolve the pattern. Numerical simulation indicates that initial patterns with certain topological properties do evolve faster to market dominance. The description of these topological properties is given and suggestions are made on the initial pattern so as to evolve faster to market dominance.

Abstract: As financial institutions increasingly adopt Large Language Models (LLMs), rigorous domain-specific evaluation becomes critical for responsible deployment. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark evaluating 23 state-of-the-art LLMs on the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) Level III exam - the gold standard for advanced financial reasoning. We assess both multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and essay-style responses using multiple prompting strategies including Chain-of-Thought and Self-Discover. Our evaluation reveals that leading models demonstrate strong capabilities, with composite scores such as 79.1% (o4-mini) and 77.3% (Gemini 2.5 Flash) on CFA Level III. These results, achieved under a revised, stricter essay grading methodology, indicate significant progress in LLM capabilities for high-stakes financial applications. Our findings provide crucial guidance for practitioners on model selection and highlight remaining challenges in cost-effective deployment and the need for nuanced interpretation of performance against professional benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent research has demonstrated that state-of-the-art LLMs and defenses remain susceptible to multi-turn jailbreak attacks. These attacks require only closed-box model access and are often easy to perform manually, posing a significant threat to the safe and secure deployment of LLM-based systems. We study the effectiveness of the Crescendo multi-turn jailbreak at the level of intermediate model representations and find that safety-aligned LMs often represent Crescendo responses as more benign than harmful, especially as the number of conversation turns increases. Our analysis indicates that at each turn, Crescendo prompts tend to keep model outputs in a "benign" region of representation space, effectively tricking the model into fulfilling harmful requests. Further, our results help explain why single-turn jailbreak defenses like circuit breakers are generally ineffective against multi-turn attacks, motivating the development of mitigations that address this generalization gap.

Abstract: Active learning for classification seeks to reduce the cost of labeling samples by finding unlabeled examples about which the current model is least certain and sending them to an annotator/expert to label. Bayesian theory can provide a probabilistic view of deep neural network models by asserting a prior distribution over model parameters and estimating the uncertainties by posterior distribution over these parameters. This paper proposes two novel active learning approaches to label one million malware examples belonging to different unknown modern malware families. The first model is Inception-V4+PCA combined with several support vector machine (SVM) algorithms (UTSVM, PSVM, SVM-GSU, TBSVM). The second model is Vision Transformer based Bayesian Neural Networks ViT-BNN. Our proposed ViT-BNN is a state-of-the-art active learning approach that differs from current methods and can apply to any particular task. The experiments demonstrate that the ViT-BNN is more stable and robust in handling uncertainty.

Abstract: The refractory period controls neuron spike firing rate, crucial for network stability and noise resistance. With advancements in spiking neural network (SNN) training methods, low-latency SNN applications have expanded. In low-latency SNNs, shorter simulation steps render traditional refractory mechanisms, which rely on empirical distributions or spike firing rates, less effective. However, omitting the refractory period amplifies the risk of neuron over-activation and reduces the system's robustness to noise. To address this challenge, we propose a historical dynamic refractory period (HDRP) model that leverages membrane potential derivative with historical refractory periods to estimate an initial refractory period and dynamically adjust its duration. Additionally, we propose a threshold-dependent refractory kernel to mitigate excessive neuron state accumulation. Our approach retains the binary characteristics of SNNs while enhancing both noise resistance and overall performance. Experimental results show that HDRP-SNN significantly reduces redundant spikes compared to traditional SNNs, and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy both on static datasets and neuromorphic datasets. Moreover, HDRP-SNN outperforms artificial neural networks (ANNs) and traditional SNNs in noise resistance, highlighting the crucial role of the HDRP mechanism in enhancing the performance of low-latency SNNs.

Abstract: Modern transportation network modeling increasingly involves the integration of diverse methodologies including sensor-based forecasting, reinforcement learning, classical flow optimization, and demand modeling that have traditionally been developed in isolation. This paper introduces Flow Through Tensors (FTT), a unified computational graph architecture that connects origin destination flows, path probabilities, and link travel times as interconnected tensors. Our framework makes three key contributions: first, it establishes a consistent mathematical structure that enables gradient-based optimization across previously separate modeling elements; second, it supports multidimensional analysis of traffic patterns over time, space, and user groups with precise quantification of system efficiency; third, it implements tensor decomposition techniques that maintain computational tractability for large scale applications. These innovations collectively enable real time control strategies, efficient coordination between multiple transportation modes and operators, and rigorous enforcement of physical network constraints. The FTT framework bridges the gap between theoretical transportation models and practical deployment needs, providing a foundation for next generation integrated mobility systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, while they remain prone to generating hallucinated or outdated responses due to their static internal knowledge. Recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have explored enhancing models' search and reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL). Although these methods demonstrate promising results, they face challenges in training stability and encounter issues such as substantial inference time and restricted capabilities due to the single-query mode. In this paper, we propose RAG-R1, a novel training framework designed to enable LLMs to adaptively leverage internal and external knowledge during the reasoning process. We further expand the generation and retrieval processes within the framework from single-query mode to multi-query parallelism, aimed at reducing inference time and enhancing the model's capabilities. Extensive experiments on seven question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the strongest baseline by up to 13.2% and decreases inference time by 11.1%.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional natural language capabilities, general-purpose models lack specialized domain knowledge for effective cybersecurity analysis. In this work, we investigate Domain-Adaptive Continuous Pretraining (DAP) as a methodology for enhancing cybersecurity understanding in pretrained LLMs while preserving general language capabilities. We systematically adapted three decoder-based architectures -- Llama-3.1-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct -- using a curated 126-million-word cybersecurity corpus from standards, academic literature, and various other sources. Our approach employed constrained training parameters and distributed FSDP training to balance domain specialization with knowledge preservation. Evaluation across three cybersecurity benchmarks, namely, CTI-MCQ, CyberMetric, and SecEval, demonstrates consistent improvements post-adaptation. The Llama-3.3-70B-Ins-DAP model achieved state-of-the-art accuracies of 0.718, 0.933, and 0.864, respectively, outperforming specialized models, including Llama-Primus-Base. Notably, competitive performance was achieved using substantially smaller datasets (118.8 million versus 2.77 billion tokens), demonstrating efficient domain specialization viability. We establish that targeted continuous pretraining enables effective cybersecurity domain adaptation with computational feasibility, providing foundations for specialized AI assistants in threat analysis, vulnerability assessment, and security documentation while challenging prevailing assumptions about data requirements for LLM specialization.

<title>Concept-based Adversarial Attack: a Probabilistic Perspective</title>

Abstract: We propose a concept-based adversarial attack framework that extends beyond single-image perturbations by adopting a probabilistic perspective. Rather than modifying a single image, our method operates on an entire concept -- represented by a probabilistic generative model or a set of images -- to generate diverse adversarial examples. Preserving the concept is essential, as it ensures that the resulting adversarial images remain identifiable as instances of the original underlying category or identity. By sampling from this concept-based adversarial distribution, we generate images that maintain the original concept but vary in pose, viewpoint, or background, thereby misleading the classifier. Mathematically, this framework remains consistent with traditional adversarial attacks in a principled manner. Our theoretical and empirical results demonstrate that concept-based adversarial attacks yield more diverse adversarial examples and effectively preserve the underlying concept, while achieving higher attack efficiency.

Abstract: The use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in high-stakes AI-based applications has increased significantly in recent years, especially since the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, despite their strong performance, LLMs introduce important legal/ethical concerns, particularly regarding privacy, data protection, and transparency. Due to these concerns, this work explores the use of Named-Entity Recognition (NER) to facilitate the privacy-preserving training (or adaptation) of LLMs. We propose a framework that uses NER technologies to anonymize sensitive information in text data, such as personal identities or geographic locations. An evaluation of the proposed privacy-preserving learning framework was conducted to measure its impact on user privacy and system performance in a particular high-stakes and sensitive setup: AI-based resume scoring for recruitment processes. The study involved two language models (BERT and RoBERTa) and six anonymization algorithms (based on Presidio, FLAIR, BERT, and different versions of GPT) applied to a database of 24,000 candidate profiles. The findings indicate that the proposed privacy preservation techniques effectively maintain system performance while playing a critical role in safeguarding candidate confidentiality, thus promoting trust in the experimented scenario. On top of the proposed privacy-preserving approach, we also experiment applying an existing approach that reduces the gender bias in LLMs, thus finally obtaining our proposed Privacy- and Bias-aware LLMs (PB-LLMs). Note that the proposed PB-LLMs have been evaluated in a particular setup (resume scoring), but are generally applicable to any other LLM-based AI application.

Abstract: Condition monitoring subsea pipelines in low-visibility underwater environments poses significant challenges due to turbidity, light distortion, and image degradation. Traditional visual-based inspection systems often fail to provide reliable data for mapping, object recognition, or defect detection in such conditions. This study explores the integration of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to enhance image quality, detect pipeline structures, and support autonomous fault diagnosis. This study conducts a comparative analysis of two most robust versions of YOLOv8 and Yolov11 and their three variants tailored for image segmentation tasks in complex and low-visibility subsea environments. Using pipeline inspection datasets captured beneath the seabed, it evaluates model performance in accurately delineating target structures under challenging visual conditions. The results indicated that YOLOv11 outperformed YOLOv8 in overall performance.

Abstract: Privacy policy documents are often lengthy, complex, and difficult for non-expert users to interpret, leading to a lack of transparency regarding the collection, processing, and sharing of personal data. As concerns over online privacy grow, it is essential to develop automated tools capable of analyzing privacy policies and identifying potential risks. In this study, we explore the potential of interactive graph visualizations to enhance user understanding of privacy policies by representing policy terms as structured graph models. This approach makes complex relationships more accessible and enables users to make informed decisions about their personal data (RQ1). We also employ graph mining algorithms to identify key themes, such as User Activity and Device Information, using dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE and PCA to assess clustering effectiveness. Our findings reveal that graph-based clustering improves policy content interpretability. It highlights patterns in user tracking and data sharing, which supports forensic investigations and identifies regulatory non-compliance. This research advances AI-driven tools for auditing privacy policies by integrating interactive visualizations with graph mining. Enhanced transparency fosters accountability and trust.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for transforming digital health by enabling automated medical question answering. However, ensuring these models meet critical industry standards for factual accuracy, usefulness, and safety remains a challenge, especially for open-source solutions. We present a rigorous benchmarking framework using a dataset of over 1,000 health questions. We assess model performance across honesty, helpfulness, and harmlessness. Our results highlight trade-offs between factual reliability and safety among evaluated models -- Mistral-7B, BioMistral-7B-DARE, and AlpaCare-13B. AlpaCare-13B achieves the highest accuracy (91.7%) and harmlessness (0.92), while domain-specific tuning in BioMistral-7B-DARE boosts safety (0.90) despite its smaller scale. Few-shot prompting improves accuracy from 78% to 85%, and all models show reduced helpfulness on complex queries, highlighting ongoing challenges in clinical QA.

Abstract: Multimodal learning faces a fundamental tension between deep, fine-grained fusion and computational scalability. While cross-attention models achieve strong performance through exhaustive pairwise fusion, their quadratic complexity is prohibitive for settings with many modalities. We address this challenge with Gated Recurrent Fusion (GRF), a novel architecture that captures the power of cross-modal attention within a linearly scalable, recurrent pipeline. Our method processes modalities sequentially, updating an evolving multimodal context vector at each step. The core of our approach is a fusion block built on Transformer Decoder layers that performs symmetric cross-attention, mutually enriching the shared context and the incoming modality. This enriched information is then integrated via a Gated Fusion Unit (GFU) a GRU-inspired mechanism that dynamically arbitrates information flow, enabling the model to selectively retain or discard features. This stateful, recurrent design scales linearly with the number of modalities, O(n), making it ideal for high-modality environments. Experiments on the CMU-MOSI benchmark demonstrate that GRF achieves competitive performance compared to more complex baselines. Visualizations of the embedding space further illustrate that GRF creates structured, class-separable representations through its progressive fusion mechanism. Our work presents a robust and efficient paradigm for powerful, scalable multimodal representation learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to increasingly sophisticated safety protocols and features designed to prevent harmful, unethical, or unauthorized outputs. However, these guardrails remain susceptible to novel and creative forms of adversarial prompting, including manually generated test cases. In this work, we present two new test cases in mental health for (i) suicide and (ii) self-harm, using multi-step, prompt-level jailbreaking and bypass built-in content and safety filters. We show that user intent is disregarded, leading to the generation of detailed harmful content and instructions that could cause real-world harm. We conduct an empirical evaluation across six widely available LLMs, demonstrating the generalizability and reliability of the bypass. We assess these findings and the multilayered ethical tensions that they present for their implications on prompt-response filtering and context- and task-specific model development. We recommend a more comprehensive and systematic approach to AI safety and ethics while emphasizing the need for continuous adversarial testing in safety-critical AI deployments. We also argue that while certain clearly defined safety measures and guardrails can and must be implemented in LLMs, ensuring robust and comprehensive safety across all use cases and domains remains extremely challenging given the current technical maturity of general-purpose LLMs.

Abstract: Learning to perform activities through demonstration requires extracting meaningful information about the environment from observations. In this research, we investigate the challenge of planning high-level goal-oriented actions in a simulation setting from an egocentric perspective. We present a novel task, interactive action planning, and propose an approach that combines topological affordance memory with transformer architecture. The process of memorizing the environment's structure through extracting affordances facilitates selecting appropriate actions based on the context. Moreover, the memory model allows us to detect action deviations while accomplishing specific objectives. To assess the method's versatility, we evaluate it in a realistic interactive simulation environment. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach learns meaningful representations, resulting in improved performance and robust when action deviations occur.

Abstract: This study evaluates how well large language models (LLMs) can classify ICD-10 codes from hospital discharge summaries, a critical but error-prone task in healthcare. Using 1,500 summaries from the MIMIC-IV dataset and focusing on the 10 most frequent ICD-10 codes, the study tested 11 LLMs, including models with and without structured reasoning capabilities. Medical terms were extracted using a clinical NLP tool (cTAKES), and models were prompted in a consistent, coder-like format. None of the models achieved an F1 score above 57%, with performance dropping as code specificity increased. Reasoning-based models generally outperformed non-reasoning ones, with Gemini 2.5 Pro performing best overall. Some codes, such as those related to chronic heart disease, were classified more accurately than others. The findings suggest that while LLMs can assist human coders, they are not yet reliable enough for full automation. Future work should explore hybrid methods, domain-specific model training, and the use of structured clinical data.

Abstract: Modeling the decision-making behavior of vehicles presents unique challenges, particularly during unprotected left turns at intersections, where the uncertainty of human drivers is especially pronounced. In this context, connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology emerges as a promising avenue for effectively managing such interactions while ensuring safety and efficiency. Traditional approaches, often grounded in game theory assumptions of perfect rationality, may inadequately capture the complexities of real-world scenarios and drivers' decision-making errors. To fill this gap, we propose a novel decision-making model for vehicle unprotected left-turn scenarios, integrating game theory with considerations for drivers' bounded rationality. Our model, formulated as a two-player normal-form game solved by a quantal response equilibrium (QRE), offers a more nuanced depiction of driver decision-making processes compared to Nash equilibrium (NE) models. Leveraging an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm coupled with a subtle neural network trained on precise microscopic vehicle trajectory data, we optimize model parameters to accurately reflect drivers' interaction-aware bounded rationality and driving styles. Through comprehensive simulation experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed model in capturing the interaction-aware bounded rationality and decision tendencies between players. The proposed model proves to be more realistic and efficient than NE models in unprotected left-turn scenarios. Our findings contribute valuable insights into the vehicle decision-making behaviors with bounded rationality, thereby informing the development of more robust and realistic autonomous driving systems.

In education, these advancements could influence assessment design and question answering, presenting both opportunities and challenges. To investigate these effects, we introduce a high-quality dataset of 201 university-level STEM questions, manually annotated with features such as image type, role, problem complexity, and question format. Our study analyzes how these features affect generative AI performance compared to students. We evaluate four model families with five prompting strategies, comparing results to the average of 546 student responses per question. Although the best model correctly answers on average 58.5 % of the questions using majority vote aggregation, human participants consistently outperform AI on questions involving visual components. Interestingly, human performance remains stable across question features but varies by subject, whereas AI performance is susceptible to both subject matter and question features. Finally, we provide actionable insights for educators, demonstrating how question design can enhance academic integrity by leveraging features that challenge current AI systems without increasing the cognitive burden for students.

Abstract: We explore applying a tensor completion approach to complete the DrugMatrix toxicogenomics dataset. Our hypothesis is that by preserving the 3-dimensional structure of the data, which comprises tissue, treatment, and transcriptomic measurements, and by leveraging a machine learning formulation, our approach will improve upon prior state-of-the-art results. Our results demonstrate that the new tensor-based method more accurately reflects the original data distribution and effectively captures organ-specific variability. The proposed tensor-based methodology achieved lower mean squared errors and mean absolute errors compared to both conventional Canonical Polyadic decomposition and 2-dimensional matrix factorization methods. In addition, our non-negative tensor completion implementation reveals relationships among tissues. Our findings not only complete the world's largest in-vivo toxicogenomics database with improved accuracy but also offer a promising methodology for future studies of drugs that may cross species barriers, for example, from rats to humans.

Abstract: Transfer learning in Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to leverage knowledge from source tasks to accelerate learning in target tasks. While prior work, such as the Attend, Adapt, and Transfer (A2T) framework, addresses negative transfer and selective transfer, other critical challenges remain underexplored. This paper introduces the Generalized Adaptive Transfer Network (GATN), a deep RL architecture designed to tackle task generalization across domains, robustness to environmental changes, and computational efficiency in transfer. GATN employs a domain-agnostic representation module, a robustness-aware policy adapter, and an efficient transfer scheduler to achieve these goals. We evaluate GATN on diverse benchmarks, including Atari 2600, MuJoCo, and a custom chatbot dialogue environment, demonstrating superior performance in cross-domain generalization, resilience to dynamic environments, and reduced computational overhead compared to baselines. Our findings suggest GATN is a versatile framework for real-world RL applications, such as adaptive chatbots and robotic control.

Abstract: This study employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast key performance indicators (KPIs), Occupancy (OCC), Average Daily Rate (ADR), and Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR), across five major cities: Manchester, Amsterdam, Dubai, Bangkok, and Mumbai. The cities were selected for their diverse economic profiles and hospitality dynamics. Monthly data from 2018 to 2025 were used, with 80% for training and 20% for testing. Advanced time series decomposition and machine learning techniques enabled accurate forecasting and trend identification. Results show that Manchester and Mumbai exhibited the highest predictive accuracy, reflecting stable demand patterns, while Dubai and Bangkok demonstrated higher variability due to seasonal and event-driven influences. The findings validate the effectiveness of LSTM models for urban hospitality forecasting and provide a comparative framework for data-driven decision-making. The models generalisability across global cities highlights its potential utility for tourism stakeholders and urban planners.

<title>On the Mathematical Impossibility of Safe Universal Approximators</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03031</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.03031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish fundamental mathematical limits on universal approximation theorem (UAT) system alignment by proving that catastrophic failures are an inescapable feature of any useful computational system. Our central thesis is that for any universal approximator, the expressive power required for useful computation is inextricably linked to a dense set of instabilities that make perfect, reliable control a mathematical impossibility. We prove this through a three-level argument that leaves no escape routes for any class of universal approximator architecture. i) Combinatorial Necessity: For the vast majority of practical universal approximators (e.g., those using ReLU activations), we prove that the density of catastrophic failure points is directly proportional to the network's expressive power. ii) Topological Necessity: For any theoretical universal approximator, we use singularity theory to prove that the ability to approximate generic functions requires the ability to implement the dense, catastrophic singularities that characterize them. iii) Empirical Necessity: We prove that the universal existence of adversarial examples is empirical evidence that real-world tasks are themselves catastrophic, forcing any successful model to learn and replicate these instabilities. These results, combined with a quantitative "Impossibility Sandwich" showing that the minimum complexity for usefulness exceeds the maximum complexity for safety, demonstrate that perfect alignment is not an engineering challenge but a mathematical impossibility. This foundational result reframes UAT safety from a problem of "how to achieve perfect control" to one of "how to operate safely in the presence of irreducible uncontrollability," with profound implications for the future of UAT development and governance.

Abstract: Background: Clinical documentation represents a significant burden for healthcare providers, with physicians spending up to 2 hours daily on administrative tasks. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer promising solutions, but privacy concerns and computational requirements limit their adoption in healthcare settings. Objective: To develop and evaluate a privacy-preserving, on-device medical transcription system using a fine-tuned Llama 3.2 1B model capable of generating structured medical notes from medical transcriptions while maintaining complete data sovereignty entirely in the browser. Methods: We fine-tuned a Llama 3.2 1B model using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA on 1,500 synthetic medical transcription-to-structured note pairs. The model was evaluated against the base Llama 3.2 1B on two datasets: 100 endocrinology transcripts and 140 modified ACI benchmark cases. Evaluation employed both statistical metrics (ROUGE, BERTScore, BLEURT) and LLM-as-judge assessments across multiple clinical quality dimensions. Results: The fine-tuned OnDevice model demonstrated substantial improvements over the base model. On the ACI benchmark, ROUGE-1 scores increased from 0.346 to 0.496, while BERTScore F1 improved from 0.832 to 0.866. Clinical quality assessments showed marked reduction in major hallucinations (from 85 to 35 cases) and enhanced factual correctness (2.81 to 3.54 on 5-point scale). Similar improvements were observed on the internal evaluation dataset, with composite scores increasing from 3.13 to 4.43 (+41.5%). Conclusions: Fine-tuning compact LLMs for medical transcription yields clinically meaningful improvements while enabling complete on-device browser deployment. This approach addresses key barriers to AI adoption in healthcare: privacy preservation, cost reduction, and accessibility for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: The (generative) artificial intelligence (AI) era has profoundly reshaped the meaning and value of data. No longer confined to static content, data now permeates every stage of the AI lifecycle from the training samples that shape model parameters to the prompts and outputs that drive real-world model deployment. This shift renders traditional notions of data protection insufficient, while the boundaries of what needs safeguarding remain poorly defined. Failing to safeguard data in AI systems can inflict societal and individual, underscoring the urgent need to clearly delineate the scope of and rigorously enforce data protection. In this perspective, we propose a four-level taxonomy, including non-usability, privacy preservation, traceability, and deletability, that captures the diverse protection needs arising in modern (generative) AI models and systems. Our framework offers a structured understanding of the trade-offs between data utility and control, spanning the entire AI pipeline, including training datasets, model weights, system prompts, and AI-generated content. We analyze representative technical approaches at each level and reveal regulatory blind spots that leave critical assets exposed. By offering a structured lens to align future AI technologies and governance with trustworthy data practices, we underscore the urgency of rethinking data protection for modern AI techniques and provide timely guidance for developers, researchers, and regulators alike.

<title>Adaptive Cubic Regularized Second-Order Latent Factor Analysis Model</title>

arXiv:2507.03036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional and incomplete (HDI) data, characterized by massive node interactions, have become ubiquitous across various real-world applications. Second-order latent factor models have shown promising performance in modeling this type of data. Nevertheless, due to the bilinear and non-convex nature of the SLF model's objective function, incorporating a damping term into the Hessian approximation and carefully tuning associated parameters become essential. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new approach in this study, named the adaptive cubic regularized second-order latent factor analysis (ACRSLF) model. The proposed ACRSLF adopts the two-fold ideas: 1) self-tuning cubic regularization that dynamically mitigates non-convex optimization instabilities; 2) multi-Hessian-vector product evaluation during conjugate gradient iterations for precise second-order information assimilation. Comprehensive experiments on two industrial HDI datasets demonstrate that the ACRSLF converges faster and achieves higher representation accuracy than the advancing optimizer-based LFA models.

Abstract: Next token prediction paradigm has been prevailing for autoregressive models in the era of LLMs. The current default sampling choice for popular LLMs is temperature scaling together with nucleus sampling to balance diversity and coherence. Nevertheless, such approach leads to inferior performance in various NLP tasks when the model is not certain about testing questions. To this end, we propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next Token Prediction (CNTP). In the decoding process, if the model has comparatively high prediction entropy at a certain step, we sample multiple trials starting from the step independently and stop when encountering any punctuation. Then we select the trial with the lowest perplexity score viewed as the most probable and reliable trial path given the model's capacity. The trial number is negatively correlated with the prediction confidence, i.e., the less confident the model is, the more trials it should sample. This is consistent with human beings' behaviour: when feeling uncertain or unconfident, one tends to think more creatively, exploring multiple thinking paths, to cautiously select the path one feels most confident about. Extensive experiments on both LLMs and MLLMs show that our proposed CNTP approach outperforms existing standard decoding strategies consistently by a clear margin. Moreover, the integration of CNTP with self consistency can further improve over vanilla self consistency. We believe our proposed CNTP has the potential to become one of the default choices for LLM decoding. Code is available at https://github.com/wyzjack/CNTP.

<title>Optimas: Optimizing Compound AI Systems with Globally Aligned Local Rewards</title>

Abstract: Compound AI systems integrating multiple components, such as Large Language Models, specialized tools, and traditional machine learning models, are increasingly deployed to solve complex real-world tasks. However, optimizing compound systems remains challenging due to their non-differentiable structures and diverse configuration types across components, including prompts, hyperparameters, and model parameters. To address this challenge, we propose Optimas, a unified framework for effective optimization of compound systems. The core idea of Optimas is to maintain one Local Reward Function (LRF) per component, each satisfying a local-global alignment property, i.e., each component's local reward correlates with the global system performance. In each iteration, Optimas efficiently adapts the LRFs to maintain this property while simultaneously maximizing each component's local reward. This approach enables independent updates of heterogeneous configurations using the designated optimization method, while ensuring that local improvements consistently lead to performance gains. We present extensive evaluations across five real-world compound systems to demonstrate that Optimas outperforms strong baselines by an average improvement of 11.92%, offering a general and effective approach for improving compound systems.

Abstract: Memory storage for Large Language models (LLMs) is becoming an increasingly active area of research, particularly for enabling personalization across long conversations. We propose Pref-LSTM, a dynamic and lightweight framework that combines a BERT-based classifier with a LSTM memory module that generates memory embedding which then is soft-prompt injected into a frozen LLM. We synthetically curate a dataset of preference and non-preference conversation turns to train our BERT-based classifier. Although our LSTM-based memory encoder did not yield strong results, we find that the BERT-based classifier performs reliably in identifying explicit and implicit user preferences. Our research demonstrates the viability of using preference filtering with LSTM gating principals as an efficient path towards scalable user preference modeling, without extensive overhead and fine-tuning.

Abstract: Early evaluation of children's language is frustrated by the high pitch, long phones, and sparse data that derail automatic speech recognisers. We introduce K-Function, a unified framework that combines accurate sub-word transcription, objective scoring, and actionable feedback. Its core, Kids-WFST, merges a Wav2Vec2 phoneme encoder with a phoneme-similarity Dysfluent-WFST to capture child-specific errors while remaining fully interpretable. Kids-WFST attains 1.39% phoneme error on MyST and 8.61% on Multitudes--absolute gains of 10.47 and 7.06 points over a greedy-search decoder. These high-fidelity transcripts power an LLM that grades verbal skills, milestones, reading, and comprehension, aligning with human proctors and supplying tongue-and-lip visualizations plus targeted advice. The results show that precise phoneme recognition cements a complete diagnostic-feedback loop, paving the way for scalable, clinician-ready language assessment.

Abstract: The Artificial Intelligence field has focused on developing optimisation methods to solve multiple problems, specifically problems that we thought to be only solvable through cognition. The obtained results have been outstanding, being able to even surpass the Turing Test. However, we have found that these optimisation methods share some fundamental flaws that impede them to become a true artificial cognition. Specifically, the field have identified catastrophic forgetting as a fundamental problem to develop such cognition. This paper formally proves that this problem is inherent to optimisation methods, and as such it will always limit approaches that try to solve the Artificial General Intelligence problem as an optimisation problem. Additionally, it addresses the problem of overfitting and discuss about other smaller problems that optimisation methods pose. Finally, it empirically shows how world-modelling methods avoid suffering from either problem. As a conclusion, the field of Artificial Intelligence needs to look outside the machine learning field to find methods capable of developing an artificial cognition.

<title>Counterfactual Tuning for Temporal Sensitivity Enhancement in Large Language Model-based Recommendation</title>

Abstract: Recent advances have applied large language models (LLMs) to sequential recommendation, leveraging their pre-training knowledge and reasoning capabilities to provide more personalized user experiences. However, existing LLM-based methods fail to sufficiently leverage the rich temporal information inherent in users' historical interaction sequences, stemming from fundamental architectural constraints: LLMs process information through self-attention mechanisms that lack inherent sequence ordering and rely on position embeddings designed primarily for natural language rather than user interaction sequences. This limitation significantly impairs their ability to capture the evolution of user preferences over time and predict future interests accurately.
  To address this critical gap, we propose Counterfactual Enhanced Temporal Framework for LLM-Based Recommendation (CETRec). CETRec is grounded in causal inference principles, which allow it to isolate and measure the specific impact of temporal information on recommendation outcomes. By conceptualizing temporal order as an independent causal factor distinct from item content, we can quantify its unique contribution through counterfactual reasoning--comparing what recommendations would be made with and without temporal information while keeping all other factors constant. This causal framing enables CETRec to design a novel counterfactual tuning objective that directly optimizes the model's temporal sensitivity, teaching LLMs to recognize both absolute timestamps and relative ordering patterns in user histories. Combined with our counterfactual tuning task derived from causal analysis, CETRec effectively enhances LLMs' awareness of both absolute order (how recently items were interacted with) and relative order (the sequential relationships between items).

Abstract: Machine-learned systems are in widespread use for making decisions about humans, and it is important that they are fair, i.e., not biased against individuals based on sensitive attributes.
  We present a general framework of runtime verification of algorithmic fairness for systems whose models are unknown, but are assumed to have a Markov chain structure, with or without full observation of the state space.
  We introduce a specification language that can model many common algorithmic fairness properties, such as demographic parity, equal opportunity, and social burden.
  We build monitors that observe a long sequence of events as generated by a given system, and output, after each observation, a quantitative estimate of how fair or biased the system was on that run until that point in time.
  The estimate is proven to be correct modulo a variable error bound and a given confidence level, where the error bound gets tighter as the observed sequence gets longer.
  We present two categories of monitoring algorithms, namely ones with a uniform error bound across all time points, and ones with weaker non-uniform, pointwise error bounds at different time points.
  Our monitoring algorithms use statistical tools that are adapted to suit the dynamic requirements of monitoring and the special needs of the fairness specifications.
  Using a prototype implementation, we show how we can monitor if a bank is fair in giving loans to applicants from different social backgrounds, and if a college is fair in admitting students while maintaining a reasonable financial burden on the society.
  In these experiments, our monitors took less than a millisecond to update their verdicts after each observation.

Abstract: In the field of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), a fundamental challenge is to facilitate human understanding of robots. The emerging domain of eXplainable HRI (XHRI) investigates methods to generate explanations and evaluate their impact on human-robot interactions. Previous works have highlighted the need to personalise the level of detail of these explanations to enhance usability and comprehension. Our paper presents a framework designed to update and retrieve user knowledge-memory models, allowing for adapting the explanations' level of detail while referencing previously acquired concepts. Three architectures based on our proposed framework that use Large Language Models (LLMs) are evaluated in two distinct scenarios: a hospital patrolling robot and a kitchen assistant robot. Experimental results demonstrate that a two-stage architecture, which first generates an explanation and then personalises it, is the framework architecture that effectively reduces the level of detail only when there is related user knowledge.

Abstract: The UK has pursued a distinctive path in AI regulation: less cautious than the EU but more willing to address risks than the US, and has emerged as a global leader in coordinating AI safety efforts. Impressive developments from companies like London-based DeepMind began to spark concerns in the UK about catastrophic risks from around 2012, although regulatory discussion at the time focussed on bias and discrimination. By 2022, these discussions had evolved into a "pro-innovation" strategy, in which the government directed existing regulators to take a light-touch approach, governing AI at point of use, but avoided regulating the technology or infrastructure directly. ChatGPT arrived in late 2022, galvanising concerns that this approach may be insufficient. The UK responded by establishing an AI Safety Institute to monitor risks and hosting the first international AI Safety Summit in 2023, but - unlike the EU - refrained from regulating frontier AI development in addition to its use. A new government was elected in 2024 which promised to address this gap, but at the time of writing is yet to do so.
  What should the UK do next? The government faces competing objectives: harnessing AI for economic growth and better public services while mitigating risk. In light of these, we propose establishing a flexible, principles-based regulator to oversee the most advanced AI development, defensive measures against risks from AI-enabled biological design tools, and argue that more technical work is needed to understand how to respond to AI-generated misinformation. We argue for updated legal frameworks on copyright, discrimination, and AI agents, and that regulators will have a limited but important role if AI substantially disrupts labour markets.
  If the UK gets AI regulation right, it could demonstrate how democratic societies can harness AI's benefits while managing its risks.

Abstract: Improving and understanding the training dynamics and reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become essential for their deployment in AI-based security tools, such as software vulnerability detection. In this work, we present an extensive study aimed at advancing recent RL-based finetuning techniques for LLMs in the context of vulnerability detection.
  We start by highlighting key limitations of commonly adopted LLMs, such as their tendency to over-predict certain types of vulnerabilities while failing to detect others. To address this challenge, we explore the use of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent policy-gradient method, for guiding LLM behavior through structured, rule-based rewards. We enable its application to the vulnerability detection task by redefining its advantage functions and reward signals using annotations from widely used datasets in the field, including BigVul, DiverseVul, and CleanVul.
  The proposed methodology enables an extensive set of experiments, addressing multiple research questions regarding the impact of GRPO on generalization, reasoning capabilities, and performance improvements over standard supervised finetuning (SFT). Our findings offer valuable insights into the potential of RL-based training to enhance both the performance and reasoning abilities of LLMs in the context of software vulnerability detection.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in size, efficient compression techniques like quantization and sparsification are critical. While quantization maintains performance with reduced precision, structured sparsity methods, such as N:M sparsification, often fall short due to limited flexibility, and sensitivity to outlier weights. We explore 8:16 semi-structured sparsity, demonstrating its ability to surpass the Performance Threshold-where a compressed model matches the accuracy of its uncompressed or smaller counterpart under equivalent memory constraints. Compared to 2:4 sparsity, 8:16 offers greater flexibility with minimal storage overhead (0.875 vs. 0.75 bits/element). We also apply sparse structured patterns for salient weights, showing that structured sparsity for outliers is competitive with unstructured approaches leading to equivalent or better results. Finally, we demonstrate that simple techniques such as variance correction and SmoothQuant like weight equalization improve sparse models performance.

<title>LATTE: Latent Trajectory Embedding for Diffusion-Generated Image Detection</title>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion-based image generators has made it increasingly difficult to distinguish generated from real images. This can erode trust in digital media, making it critical to develop generalizable detectors for generated images. Recent methods leverage diffusion denoising cues, but mainly focus on single-step reconstruction errors, ignoring the inherent sequential nature of the denoising process. In this work, we propose LATTE - Latent Trajectory Embedding - a novel approach that models the evolution of latent embeddings across several denoising timesteps. By modeling the trajectory of such embeddings rather than single-step errors, LATTE captures subtle, discriminative patterns that distinguish real from generated images. Each latent is refined by employing our latent-visual feature refinement module and aggregated into a unified representation. Afterwards, it is fused with the visual features and finally passed into a lightweight classifier. Our experiments demonstrate that LATTE surpasses the baselines on several established benchmarks, such as GenImage and DiffusionFake. Moreover, it demonstrates strong performance in cross-generator and cross-datasets settings, highlighting the potential of using the trajectory of latent embeddings for generated image detection.

Abstract: With the rise of online learning, the demand for efficient and consistent assessment in mathematics has significantly increased over the past decade. Machine Learning (ML), particularly Natural Language Processing (NLP), has been widely used for autograding student responses, particularly those involving text and/or mathematical expressions. However, there has been limited research on autograding responses involving students' handwritten graphs, despite their prevalence in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) curricula. In this study, we implement multimodal meta-learning models for autograding images containing students' handwritten graphs and text. We further compare the performance of Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) with these specially trained metalearning models. Our results, evaluated on a real-world dataset collected from our institution, show that the best-performing meta-learning models outperform VLLMs in 2-way classification tasks. In contrast, in more complex 3-way classification tasks, the best-performing VLLMs slightly outperform the meta-learning models. While VLLMs show promising results, their reliability and practical applicability remain uncertain and require further investigation.

Abstract: This article explores the feasibility of creating an "electronic copy" of a deceased researcher by training artificial intelligence (AI) on the data stored in their personal computers. By analyzing typical data volumes on inherited researcher computers, including textual files such as articles, emails, and drafts, it is estimated that approximately one million words are available for AI training. This volume is sufficient for fine-tuning advanced pre-trained models like GPT-4 to replicate a researcher's writing style, domain expertise, and rhetorical voice with high fidelity. The study also discusses the potential enhancements from including non-textual data and file metadata to enrich the AI's representation of the researcher. Extensions of the concept include communication between living researchers and their electronic copies, collaboration among individual electronic copies, as well as the creation and interconnection of organizational electronic copies to optimize information access and strategic decision-making. Ethical considerations such as ownership and security of these electronic copies are highlighted as critical for responsible implementation. The findings suggest promising opportunities for AI-driven preservation and augmentation of intellectual legacy.

Abstract: Understanding human mobility is essential for applications in public health, transportation, and urban planning. However, mobility data often suffers from sparsity due to limitations in data collection methods, such as infrequent GPS sampling or call detail record (CDR) data that only capture locations during communication events. To address this challenge, we propose BERT4Traj, a transformer based model that reconstructs complete mobility trajectories by predicting hidden visits in sparse movement sequences. Inspired by BERT's masked language modeling objective and self_attention mechanisms, BERT4Traj leverages spatial embeddings, temporal embeddings, and contextual background features such as demographics and anchor points. We evaluate BERT4Traj on real world CDR and GPS datasets collected in Kampala, Uganda, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms traditional models such as Markov Chains, KNN, RNNs, and LSTMs. Our results show that BERT4Traj effectively reconstructs detailed and continuous mobility trajectories, enhancing insights into human movement patterns.

<title>LLM-Driven Auto Configuration for Transient IoT Device Collaboration</title>

Abstract: Today's Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved from simple sensing and actuation devices to those with embedded processing and intelligent services, enabling rich collaborations between users and their devices. However, enabling such collaboration becomes challenging when transient devices need to interact with host devices in temporarily visited environments. In such cases, fine-grained access control policies are necessary to ensure secure interactions; however, manually implementing them is often impractical for non-expert users. Moreover, at run-time, the system must automatically configure the devices and enforce such fine-grained access control rules. Additionally, the system must address the heterogeneity of devices.
  In this paper, we present CollabIoT, a system that enables secure and seamless device collaboration in transient IoT environments. CollabIoT employs a Large language Model (LLM)-driven approach to convert users' high-level intents to fine-grained access control policies. To support secure and seamless device collaboration, CollabIoT adopts capability-based access control for authorization and uses lightweight proxies for policy enforcement, providing hardware-independent abstractions.
  We implement a prototype of CollabIoT's policy generation and auto configuration pipelines and evaluate its efficacy on an IoT testbed and in large-scale emulated environments. We show that our LLM-based policy generation pipeline is able to generate functional and correct policies with 100% accuracy. At runtime, our evaluation shows that our system configures new devices in ~150 ms, and our proxy-based data plane incurs network overheads of up to 2 ms and access control overheads up to 0.3 ms.

Abstract: This research investigates the efficacy of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods in detecting misclassified intersection-related crashes in police-reported narratives. Using 2019 crash data from the Iowa Department of Transportation, we implemented and compared a comprehensive set of models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, BERT Sentence Embeddings, BERT Word Embeddings, and Albert Model. Model performance was systematically validated against expert reviews of potentially misclassified narratives, providing a rigorous assessment of classification accuracy. Results demonstrated that while traditional ML methods exhibited superior overall performance compared to some DL approaches, the Albert Model achieved the highest agreement with expert classifications (73% with Expert 1) and original tabular data (58%). Statistical analysis revealed that the Albert Model maintained performance levels similar to inter-expert consistency rates, significantly outperforming other approaches, particularly on ambiguous narratives. This work addresses a critical gap in transportation safety research through multi-modal integration analysis, which achieved a 54.2% reduction in error rates by combining narrative text with structured crash data. We conclude that hybrid approaches combining automated classification with targeted expert review offer a practical methodology for improving crash data quality, with substantial implications for transportation safety management and policy development.

<title>Large Language Models for Automating Clinical Data Standardization: HL7 FHIR Use Case</title>

Abstract: For years, semantic interoperability standards have sought to streamline the exchange of clinical data, yet their deployment remains time-consuming, resource-intensive, and technically challenging. To address this, we introduce a semi-automated approach that leverages large language models specifically GPT-4o and Llama 3.2 405b to convert structured clinical datasets into HL7 FHIR format while assessing accuracy, reliability, and security. Applying our method to the MIMIC-IV database, we combined embedding techniques, clustering algorithms, and semantic retrieval to craft prompts that guide the models in mapping each tabular field to its corresponding FHIR resource. In an initial benchmark, resource identification achieved a perfect F1-score, with GPT-4o outperforming Llama 3.2 thanks to the inclusion of FHIR resource schemas within the prompt. Under real-world conditions, accuracy dipped slightly to 94 %, but refinements to the prompting strategy restored robust mappings. Error analysis revealed occasional hallucinations of non-existent attributes and mismatches in granularity, which more detailed prompts can mitigate. Overall, our study demonstrates the feasibility of context-aware, LLM-driven transformation of clinical data into HL7 FHIR, laying the groundwork for semi-automated interoperability workflows. Future work will focus on fine-tuning models with specialized medical corpora, extending support to additional standards such as HL7 CDA and OMOP, and developing an interactive interface to enable expert validation and iterative refinement.

<title>ARF-RLHF: Adaptive Reward-Following for RLHF through Emotion-Driven Self-Supervision and Trace-Biased Dynamic Optimization</title>

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and autoregressive transformers, state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4.0, DeepSeek R1, and Llama 3.3 increasingly emphasize answer depth and personalization. However, most existing RLHF approaches (e.g., PPO, DPO) still rely on a binary-preference (BT) paradigm, which, while reducing annotation costs, still requires substantial human effort and captures only group-level tendencies rather than individual preferences. To overcome these limitations, we propose Adaptive Reward-Following (ARF), a self-assessment framework that leverages a high-precision emotion analyzer achieving over 70% accuracy on GoEmotions, Sentiment140, and DailyDialog to convert free-form user feedback into continuous preference scores. We further enrich and debias these signals through lightweight data augmentations, including synonym replacement, random trace truncation, and score bias annotation algorithm. A Dynamic Adapter Preference Tracker continuously models evolving user tastes in real time, enabling our novel Trace Bias (TB) fine-tuning algorithm to optimize directly on these tracked rewards instead of coarse binary labels. Experiments on Qwen-2/2.5, Gemma-2, and Llama-3.2 across four preference domains demonstrate that ARF achieves an improvement of 3.3% over PPO and 7.6% over DPO. Moreover, TB preserves theoretical alignment with PPO and DPO objectives. Overall, ARF presents a scalable, personalized, and cost-effective approach to RLHF LLMs through autonomous reward modeling.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at logical and algorithmic reasoning, yet their emotional intelligence (EQ) still lags far behind their cognitive prowess. While reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced in other domains, its application to dialogue-especially for emotional intelligence-remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce RLVER, the first end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that leverages verifiable emotion rewards from simulated users to cultivate higher-order empathetic abilities in LLMs. Within this framework, self-consistent affective simulated users engage in dialogue rollouts and produce deterministic emotion scores during conversations, serving as reward signals to guide the LLM's learning. Fine-tuning publicly available Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model with PPO boosts its Sentient-Benchmark score from 13.3 to 79.2 while largely preserving mathematical and coding competence. Extensive experiments reveal that: (i) RLVER consistently improves multiple dialogue capabilities; (ii) Thinking and non-thinking models show distinct trends--thinking models excel in empathy and insight, while non-thinking models favor action; (iii) GRPO often yields stable gains, while PPO can push certain capabilities to a higher ceiling; (iv) More challenging environments are not always better-moderate ones can yield stronger outcomes. Our results show that RLVER is a practical route toward emotionally intelligent and broadly capable language agents.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to compute three-dimensional Magnetohydrodynamic equilibria by parametrizing Fourier modes with artificial neural networks and compare it to equilibria computed by conventional solvers. The full nonlinear global force residual across the volume in real space is then minimized with first order optimizers. Already,we observe competitive computational cost to arrive at the same minimum residuals computed by existing codes. With increased computational cost,lower minima of the residual are achieved by the neural networks,establishing a new lower bound for the force residual. We use minimally complex neural networks,and we expect significant improvements for solving not only single equilibria with neural networks,but also for computing neural network models valid over continuous distributions of equilibria.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strikingly conflicting behaviors: they can appear steadfastly overconfident in their initial answers whilst at the same time being prone to excessive doubt when challenged. To investigate this apparent paradox, we developed a novel experimental paradigm, exploiting the unique ability to obtain confidence estimates from LLMs without creating memory of their initial judgments -- something impossible in human participants. We show that LLMs -- Gemma 3, GPT4o and o1-preview -- exhibit a pronounced choice-supportive bias that reinforces and boosts their estimate of confidence in their answer, resulting in a marked resistance to change their mind. We further demonstrate that LLMs markedly overweight inconsistent compared to consistent advice, in a fashion that deviates qualitatively from normative Bayesian updating. Finally, we demonstrate that these two mechanisms -- a drive to maintain consistency with prior commitments and hypersensitivity to contradictory feedback -- parsimoniously capture LLM behavior in a different domain. Together, these findings furnish a mechanistic account of LLM confidence that explains both their stubbornness and excessive sensitivity to criticism.

Abstract: This paper explores the relationship between accent strength and articulatory features inferred from acoustic speech. To quantify accent strength, we compare phonetic transcriptions with transcriptions based on dictionary-based references, computing phoneme-level difference as a measure of accent strength. The proposed framework leverages recent self-supervised learning articulatory inversion techniques to estimate articulatory features. Analyzing a corpus of read speech from American and British English speakers, this study examines correlations between derived articulatory parameters and accent strength proxies, associating systematic articulatory differences with indexed accent strength. Results indicate that tongue positioning patterns distinguish the two dialects, with notable differences inter-dialects in rhotic and low back vowels. These findings contribute to automated accent analysis and articulatory modeling for speech processing applications.

Abstract: With the growing use of language models (LMs) in clinical environments, there is an immediate need to evaluate the accuracy and safety of LM-generated medical text. Currently, such evaluation relies solely on manual physician review. However, detecting errors in LM-generated text is challenging because 1) manual review is costly and 2) expert-composed reference outputs are often unavailable in real-world settings. While the "LM-as-judge" paradigm (a LM evaluating another LM) offers scalable evaluation, even frontier LMs can miss subtle but clinically significant errors. To address these challenges, we propose MedVAL, a self-supervised framework that leverages synthetic data to train evaluator LMs to assess whether LM-generated medical outputs are factually consistent with inputs, without requiring physician labels or reference outputs. To evaluate LM performance, we introduce MedVAL-Bench, a dataset containing 840 outputs annotated by physicians, following a physician-defined taxonomy of risk levels and error categories. Across 6 diverse medical tasks and 10 state-of-the-art LMs spanning open-source, proprietary, and medically adapted models, MedVAL fine-tuning significantly improves (p < 0.001) alignment with physicians on both seen and unseen tasks, increasing average F1 scores from 66% to 83%, with per-sample safety classification scores up to 86%. MedVAL improves the performance of even the best-performing proprietary LM (GPT-4o) by 8%. To support a scalable, risk-aware pathway towards clinical integration, we open-source the 1) codebase ( https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/MedVAL ), 2) MedVAL-Bench ( https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanfordmimi/MedVAL-Bench ), and 3) MedVAL-4B ( https://huggingface.co/stanfordmimi/MedVAL-4B ), the best-performing open-source LM. Our research provides the first evidence of LMs approaching expert-level validation ability for medical text.

Abstract: Large language model assistants (LLM-assistants) present new opportunities to transform software development. Developers are increasingly adopting these tools across tasks, including coding, testing, debugging, documentation, and design. Yet, despite growing interest, there is no synthesis of how LLM-assistants affect software developer productivity. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review of 37 peer-reviewed studies published between January 2014 and December 2024 that examine this impact. Our analysis reveals that LLM-assistants offer both considerable benefits and critical risks. Commonly reported gains include minimized code search, accelerated development, and the automation of trivial and repetitive tasks. However, studies also highlight concerns around cognitive offloading, reduced team collaboration, and inconsistent effects on code quality. While the majority of studies (92%) adopt a multi-dimensional perspective by examining at least two SPACE dimensions, reflecting increased awareness of the complexity of developer productivity, only 14% extend beyond three dimensions, indicating substantial room for more integrated evaluations. Satisfaction, Performance, and Efficiency are the most frequently investigated dimensions, whereas Communication and Activity remain underexplored. Most studies are exploratory (64%) and methodologically diverse, but lack longitudinal and team-based evaluations. This review surfaces key research gaps and provides recommendations for future research and practice. All artifacts associated with this study are publicly available at https://zenodo.org/records/15788502.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed various domains, particularly computer science (CS) education. These models exhibit remarkable capabilities in code-related tasks and problem-solving, raising questions about their potential and limitations in advanced CS contexts. This study presents a novel bilingual (English-Romanian) multimodal (text and image) dataset of multiple-choice questions derived from a high-level computer science competition. A particularity of our dataset is that the problems are conceived such that some of them are easier solved using reasoning on paper, while for others writing code is more efficient. We systematically evaluate State of The Art LLMs on this dataset, analyzing their performance on theoretical programming tasks. Our findings reveal the strengths and limitations of current LLMs, including the influence of language choice (English vs. Romanian), providing insights into their applicability in CS education and competition settings. We also address critical ethical considerations surrounding educational integrity and the fairness of assessments in the context of LLM usage. These discussions aim to inform future educational practices and policies. To support further research, our dataset will be made publicly available in both English and Romanian. Additionally, we release an educational application tailored for Romanian students, enabling them to self-assess using the dataset in an interactive and practice-oriented environment.

Abstract: Reasoning models generate chain-of-thought (CoT) tokens before their final output, but how this affects their vulnerability to jailbreak attacks remains unclear. While traditional language models make refusal decisions at the prompt-response boundary, we find evidence that DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B makes these decisions within its CoT generation. We identify a linear direction in activation space during CoT token generation that predicts whether the model will refuse or comply -- termed the "caution" direction because it corresponds to cautious reasoning patterns in the generated text. Ablating this direction from model activations increases harmful compliance, effectively jailbreaking the model. We additionally show that intervening only on CoT token activations suffices to control final outputs, and that incorporating this direction into prompt-based attacks improves success rates. Our findings suggest that the chain-of-thought itself is a promising new target for adversarial manipulation in reasoning models.

Abstract: Transfer learning has become an essential paradigm in artificial intelligence, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a source task to improve performance on a target task. This approach, particularly through techniques such as pretraining and fine-tuning, has seen significant success in fields like computer vision and natural language processing. However, despite its widespread use, how to reliably assess the transferability of knowledge remains a challenge. Understanding the theoretical underpinnings of each transferability metric is critical for ensuring the success of transfer learning. In this survey, we provide a unified taxonomy of transferability metrics, categorizing them based on transferable knowledge types and measurement granularity. This work examines the various metrics developed to evaluate the potential of source knowledge for transfer learning and their applicability across different learning paradigms emphasizing the need for careful selection of these metrics. By offering insights into how different metrics work under varying conditions, this survey aims to guide researchers and practitioners in selecting the most appropriate metric for specific applications, contributing to more efficient, reliable, and trustworthy AI systems. Finally, we discuss some open challenges in this field and propose future research directions to further advance the application of transferability metrics in trustworthy transfer learning.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL)-based general circulation models (GCMs) are emerging as fast simulators, yet their ability to replicate extreme events outside their training range remains unknown. Here, we evaluate two such models -- the hybrid Neural General Circulation Model (NGCM) and purely data-driven Deep Learning Earth System Model (DL\textit{ESy}M) -- against a conventional high-resolution land-atmosphere model (HiRAM) in simulating land heatwaves and coldwaves. All models are forced with observed sea surface temperatures and sea ice over 1900-2020, focusing on the out-of-sample early-20th-century period (1900-1960). Both DL models generalize successfully to unseen climate conditions, broadly reproducing the frequency and spatial patterns of heatwave and cold wave events during 1900-1960 with skill comparable to HiRAM. An exception is over portions of North Asia and North America, where all models perform poorly during 1940-1960. Due to excessive temperature autocorrelation, DL\textit{ESy}M tends to overestimate heatwave and cold wave frequencies, whereas the physics-DL hybrid NGCM exhibits persistence more similar to HiRAM.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into applications ranging from review summarization to medical diagnosis support, where they affect human decisions. Even though LLMs perform well in many tasks, they may also inherit societal or cognitive biases, which can inadvertently transfer to humans. We investigate when and how LLMs expose users to biased content and quantify its severity. Specifically, we assess three LLM families in summarization and news fact-checking tasks, evaluating how much LLMs stay consistent with their context and/or hallucinate. Our findings show that LLMs expose users to content that changes the sentiment of the context in 21.86% of the cases, hallucinates on post-knowledge-cutoff data questions in 57.33% of the cases, and primacy bias in 5.94% of the cases. We evaluate 18 distinct mitigation methods across three LLM families and find that targeted interventions can be effective. Given the prevalent use of LLMs in high-stakes domains, such as healthcare or legal analysis, our results highlight the need for robust technical safeguards and for developing user-centered interventions that address LLM limitations.

Abstract: Sudden Death Syndrome (SDS), caused by Fusarium virguliforme, poses a significant threat to soybean production. This study presents an AI-driven web application for early detection of SDS on soybean leaves using hyperspectral imaging, enabling diagnosis prior to visible symptom onset. Leaf samples from healthy and inoculated plants were scanned using a portable hyperspectral imaging system (398-1011 nm), and a Genetic Algorithm was employed to select five informative wavelengths (505.4, 563.7, 712.2, 812.9, and 908.4 nm) critical for discriminating infection status. These selected bands were fed into a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract spatial-spectral features, which were subsequently classified using ten classical machine learning models. Ensemble classifiers (Random Forest, AdaBoost), Linear SVM, and Neural Net achieved the highest accuracy (>98%) and minimal error across all folds, as confirmed by confusion matrices and cross-validation metrics. Poor performance by Gaussian Process and QDA highlighted their unsuitability for this dataset. The trained models were deployed within a web application that enables users to upload hyperspectral leaf images, visualize spectral profiles, and receive real-time classification results. This system supports rapid and accessible plant disease diagnostics, contributing to precision agriculture practices. Future work will expand the training dataset to encompass diverse genotypes, field conditions, and disease stages, and will extend the system for multiclass disease classification and broader crop applicability.

Abstract: This survey study investigates how digital humanists perceive and approach generative AI disclosure in research. The results indicate that while digital humanities scholars acknowledge the importance of disclosing GenAI use, the actual rate of disclosure in research practice remains low. Respondents differ in their views on which activities most require disclosure and on the most appropriate methods for doing so. Most also believe that safeguards for AI disclosure should be established through institutional policies rather than left to individual decisions. The study's findings will offer empirical guidance to scholars, institutional leaders, funders, and other stakeholders responsible for shaping effective disclosure policies.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) allows model builders to capture the task specific parameters into adapters, which are a fraction of the size of the original base model. Popularity of PEFT technique for fine-tuning has led to creation of a large number of adapters for popular Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing frameworks fall short in supporting inference or fine-tuning with multiple adapters in the following ways. 1) For fine-tuning, each job needs to deploy its dedicated base model instance, which results in excessive GPU memory consumption and poor GPU utilization. 2) While popular inference platforms can serve multiple PEFT adapters, they do not allow independent resource management or mixing of different PEFT methods. 3) They cannot share resources (such as base model instance) between inference and fine-tuning jobs. 4) They do not provide privacy to users who may not wish to expose their fine-tuned parameters to service providers. In Symbiosis, we address the above problems by enabling as-a-service deployment of base model. The base model layers can be shared across multiple inference or fine-tuning processes. Our split-execution technique decouples the execution of client-specific adapters and layers from the frozen base model layers offering them flexibility to manage their resources, to select their fine-tuning method, to achieve their performance goals. Our approach is transparent to models and works out-of-the-box for most models in the transformers library. Our evaluation on Llama2-13B shows the compared to baseline, Symbiosis can fine-tune 4X more adapters on the same set of GPUs in the same amount of time.

Abstract: To be effective, efficient, and diverse, deep learning models need to dynamically choose its architecture based on signals from a population of neurons. We hypothesize dynamic routing models can be improved with neural inhibition in those neural populations. This means signals commonly shared among the various modes of data statistics can be inhibited so that the routing model can choose a specialized expert path for each data sample. Only through inhibition is the routing mechanism able to effectively select neural pathways. We believe this is an under-studied and under-verified implementation methodology for Mixture-of-Experts, dynamic routing, and transformer language models. We provide experimental evidence that the neural inhibition algorithm significantly boosts the performance of general tasks and motivates more effort to be invested in this research direction.

<title>The role of gain neuromodulation in layer-5 pyramidal neurons</title>

Abstract: Biological and artificial learning systems alike confront the plasticity-stability dilemma. In the brain, neuromodulators such as acetylcholine and noradrenaline relieve this tension by tuning neuronal gain and inhibitory gating, balancing segregation and integration of circuits. Fed by dense cholinergic and noradrenergic projections from the ascending arousal system, layer-5 pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex offer a relevant substrate for understanding these dynamics. When distal dendritic signals coincide with back-propagating action potentials, calcium plateaus turn a single somatic spike into a high-gain burst, and interneuron inhibition sculpts the output. These properties make layer-5 cells gain-tunable amplifiers that translate neuromodulatory cues into flexible cortical activity. To capture this mechanism we developed a two-compartment Izhikevich model for pyramidal neurons and single-compartment somatostatin (SOM) and parvalbumin (PV) interneurons, linked by Gaussian connectivity and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). The soma and apical dendrite are so coupled that somatic spikes back-propagate, while dendritic plateaus can switch the soma from regular firing to bursting by shifting reset and adaptation variables. We show that stronger dendritic drive or tighter coupling raise gain by increasing the likelihood of calcium-triggered somatic bursts. In contrast, dendritic-targeted inhibition suppresses gain, while somatic-targeted inhibition raises the firing threshold of neighboring neurons, thus gating neurons output. Notably, bursting accelerates STDP, supporting rapid synaptic reconfiguration and flexibility.This suggests that brief gain pulses driven by neuromodulators could serve as an adaptive two-timescale optimization mechanism, effectively modulating the synaptic weight updates.

<title>On Jailbreaking Quantized Language Models Through Fault Injection Attacks</title>

Abstract: The safety alignment of Language Models (LMs) is a critical concern, yet their integrity can be challenged by direct parameter manipulation attacks, such as those potentially induced by fault injection. As LMs are increasingly deployed using low-precision quantization for efficiency, this paper investigates the efficacy of such attacks for jailbreaking aligned LMs across different quantization schemes. We propose gradient-guided attacks, including a tailored progressive bit-level search algorithm introduced herein and a comparative word-level (single weight update) attack. Our evaluation on Llama-3.2-3B, Phi-4-mini, and Llama-3-8B across FP16 (baseline), and weight-only quantization (FP8, INT8, INT4) reveals that quantization significantly influences attack success. While attacks readily achieve high success (>80\% Attack Success Rate, ASR) on FP16 models, within an attack budget of 25 perturbations, FP8 and INT8 models exhibit ASRs below 20\% and 50\%, respectively. Increasing the perturbation budget up to 150 bit-flips, FP8 models maintained ASR below 65\%, demonstrating some resilience compared to INT8 and INT4 models that have high ASR. In addition, analysis of perturbation locations revealed differing architectural targets across quantization schemes, with (FP16, INT4) and (INT8, FP8) showing similar characteristics. Besides, jailbreaks induced in FP16 models were highly transferable to subsequent FP8/INT8 quantization (<5\% ASR difference), though INT4 significantly reduced transferred ASR (avg. 35\% drop). These findings highlight that while common quantization schemes, particularly FP8, increase the difficulty of direct parameter manipulation jailbreaks, vulnerabilities can still persist, especially through post-attack quantization.

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) traditionally relies on auditory data analysis for emotion classification. Several studies have adopted different methods for SER. However, existing SER methods often struggle to capture subtle emotional variations and generalize across diverse datasets. In this article, we use Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) as spectral features to bridge the gap between computational emotion processing and human auditory perception. To further improve robustness and feature diversity, we propose a novel 1D-CNN-based SER framework that integrates data augmentation techniques. MFCC features extracted from the augmented data are processed using a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture enhanced with channel and spatial attention mechanisms. These attention modules allow the model to highlight key emotional patterns, enhancing its ability to capture subtle variations in speech signals. The proposed method delivers cutting-edge performance, achieving the accuracy of 97.49% for SAVEE, 99.23% for RAVDESS, 89.31% for CREMA-D, 99.82% for TESS, 99.53% for EMO-DB, and 96.39% for EMOVO. Experimental results show new benchmarks in SER, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in recognizing emotional expressions with high precision. Our evaluation demonstrates that the integration of advanced Deep Learning (DL) methods substantially enhances generalization across diverse datasets, underscoring their potential to advance SER for real-world deployment in assistive technologies and human-computer interaction.

<title>RefineX: Learning to Refine Pre-training Data at Scale from Expert-Guided Programs</title>

Abstract: The foundational capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are deeply influenced by the quality of their pre-training corpora. However, enhancing data quality at scale remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the trade-off between refinement effectiveness and processing efficiency. While rule-based filtering remains the dominant paradigm, it typically operates at the document level and lacks the granularity needed to refine specific content within documents. Inspired by emerging work such as ProX, we propose $\textbf{RefineX}$, a novel framework for large-scale, surgical refinement of pre-training data through programmatic editing tasks. RefineX enables efficient and fine-grained data refinement while reliably preserving the diversity and naturalness of raw text. The core strength of RefineX lies in distilling high-quality, expert-guided end-to-end refinement results into minimal edit-based deletion programs. This high-precision distillation pipeline is used to train an efficient and reliable refine model that can systematically improve every instance in the corpus at scale. We evaluate RefineX across from-scratch pre-training at multiple model scales and find that it consistently outperforms models trained on raw, filtered, or alternatively refined data across diverse downstream tasks. On the 750M model, RefineX yields 2.6%-7.2% average gains on lighteval tasks, and achieves comparable performance using significantly fewer training tokens. Further analysis shows that RefineX reliably enhances text quality with both high efficiency and precision, outperforming prior approaches such as end-to-end generation and Prox-C. These results position RefineX as a scalable, effective, and reliable solution for optimizing pre-training data in modern LLM pipelines.

<title>Investigating Redundancy in Multimodal Large Language Models with Multiple Vision Encoders</title>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly adopt multiple vision encoders to capture diverse visual information, ranging from coarse semantics to fine grained details. While this approach is intended to enhance visual understanding capability, we observe that the performance gains from adding encoders often diminish and can even lead to performance degradation, a phenomenon we term encoder redundancy. This paper presents a systematic investigation into this issue. Through comprehensive ablation studies on state of the art multi encoder MLLMs, we empirically demonstrate that significant redundancy exists. To quantify each encoder's unique contribution, we propose a principled metric: the Conditional Utilization Rate (CUR). Building on CUR, we introduce the Information Gap (IG) to capture the overall disparity in encoder utility within a model.Our experiments reveal that certain vision encoders contribute little, or even negatively, to overall performance, confirming substantial redundancy. Our experiments reveal that certain vision encoders contribute minimally, or even negatively, to the model's performance, confirming the prevalence of redundancy. These findings highlight critical inefficiencies in current multi encoder designs and establish that our proposed metrics can serve as valuable diagnostic tools for developing more efficient and effective multimodal architectures.

<title>Conformal Information Pursuit for Interactively Guiding Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: A significant use case of instruction-finetuned Large Language Models (LLMs) is to solve question-answering tasks interactively. In this setting, an LLM agent is tasked with making a prediction by sequentially querying relevant information from the user, as opposed to a single-turn conversation. This paper explores sequential querying strategies that aim to minimize the expected number of queries. One such strategy is Information Pursuit (IP), a greedy algorithm that at each iteration selects the query that maximizes information gain or equivalently minimizes uncertainty. However, obtaining accurate estimates of mutual information or conditional entropy for LLMs is very difficult in practice due to over- or under-confident LLM probabilities, which leads to suboptimal query selection and predictive performance. To better estimate the uncertainty at each iteration, we propose Conformal Information Pursuit (C-IP), an alternative approach to sequential information gain based on conformal prediction sets. More specifically, C-IP leverages a relationship between prediction sets and conditional entropy at each iteration to estimate uncertainty based on the average size of conformal prediction sets. In contrast to conditional entropy, we find that conformal prediction sets are a distribution-free and robust method of measuring uncertainty. Experiments with 20 Questions show that C-IP obtains better predictive performance and shorter query-answer chains compared to previous approaches to IP and uncertainty-based chain-of-thought methods. Furthermore, extending to an interactive medical setting between a doctor and a patient on the MediQ dataset, C-IP achieves competitive performance with direct single-turn prediction while offering greater interpretability.

<title>MGAA: Multi-Granular Adaptive Allocation fof Low-Rank Compression of LLMs</title>

Abstract: The enormous parameter scale of large language models (LLMs) has made model compression a research hotspot, which aims to alleviate computational resource demands during deployment and inference. As a promising direction, low-rank approximation technique has made remarkable achievements. Nevertheless, unfortunately, the vast majority of studies to low-rank approximation compression generally apply uniform compression ratios across all weight matrices, while disregarding their inherently differentiated impacts on the model's performance. Although a few recent work attempts to employ heuristic search strategies to achieve the optimal parameter allocation, such strategies are computationally inefficient and lose the generalization ability in the era of LLMs. In this study, we propose a novel parameter Multi-Granular Adaptive Allocation (MGAA) method, which can adaptively allocate parameters between and within sublayers without task-specific evaluations in the compression process. MGAA consists of two components: 1) Among different sublayers, it assigns compression ratios based on their cosine similarity between inputs and outputs, allowing for a more tailored compression in sublayers with varying degrees of importance, and 2) Within each sublayer, it allocates different compression ratios to weight matrices based on their energy distribution characteristics, ensuring a consistent energy retention ratio while optimizing compression efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations of MGAA across multiple LLMs backbone models and benchmark datasets demonstrate its superior performance. Additionally, we apply our MGAA to multimodal model LLaVA, exhibiting remarkable performance improvements.

<div> privacy, large language models, encrypted search, user data, hybrid framework

Summary:
The article introduces a novel approach to utilizing large language models (LLMs) while maintaining user privacy. By employing a technique called Socratic Chain-of-Thought Reasoning, a generic user query is first sent to a powerful, untrusted LLM to generate prompts and sub-queries without accessing sensitive user data. These sub-queries are then encrypted and searched across a large dataset of private user information using a Homomorphically Encrypted Vector Database. The final response is generated by a local language model, combining the strengths of both the untrusted LLM and the local model. This hybrid framework, tested on the LoCoMo long-context QA benchmark, outperformed using the powerful LLM alone. By decomposing tasks between the untrusted LLM and the local model, this system showcases a step towards preserving user privacy while benefiting from the capabilities of advanced language models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as personal agents, accessing sensitive user data such as calendars, emails, and medical records. Users currently face a trade-off: They can send private records, many of which are stored in remote databases, to powerful but untrusted LLM providers, increasing their exposure risk. Alternatively, they can run less powerful models locally on trusted devices. We bridge this gap. Our Socratic Chain-of-Thought Reasoning first sends a generic, non-private user query to a powerful, untrusted LLM, which generates a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt and detailed sub-queries without accessing user data. Next, we embed these sub-queries and perform encrypted sub-second semantic search using our Homomorphically Encrypted Vector Database across one million entries of a single user's private data. This represents a realistic scale of personal documents, emails, and records accumulated over years of digital activity. Finally, we feed the CoT prompt and the decrypted records to a local language model and generate the final response. On the LoCoMo long-context QA benchmark, our hybrid framework, combining GPT-4o with a local Llama-3.2-1B model, outperforms using GPT-4o alone by up to 7.1 percentage points. This demonstrates a first step toward systems where tasks are decomposed and split between untrusted strong LLMs and weak local ones, preserving user privacy.

Abstract: We introduce a neural network approach for generating and customizing the trajectory of a robotic arm, that guarantees precision and repeatability. To highlight the potential of this novel method, we describe the design and implementation of the technique and show its application in an experimental setting of cognitive robotics. In this scenario, the NICO robot was characterized by the ability to point to specific points in space with precise linear movements, increasing the predictability of the robotic action during its interaction with humans. To achieve this goal, the neural network computes the forward kinematics of the robot arm. By integrating it with a generator of joint angles, another neural network was developed and trained on an artificial dataset created from suitable start and end poses of the robotic arm. Through the computation of angular velocities, the robot was characterized by its ability to perform the movement, and the quality of its action was evaluated in terms of shape and accuracy. Thanks to its broad applicability, our approach successfully generates precise trajectories that could be customized in their shape and adapted to different settings.

Summary:  
DiMo-GUI is a framework for grounding natural language queries in GUIs that incorporates dynamic visual grounding and modality-aware optimization. It splits the input into textual and iconic elements, allowing independent reasoning using vision-language models. The method dynamically focuses attention by generating candidate focal regions and incrementally zooming in to refine results when predictions are ambiguous. This hierarchical refinement process helps disambiguate visually cluttered layouts without additional training. Evaluation on standard GUI grounding benchmarks shows consistent improvements over baseline pipelines, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining modality separation with region-focused reasoning. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Grounding natural language queries in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) poses unique challenges due to the diversity of visual elements, spatial clutter, and the ambiguity of language. In this paper, we introduce DiMo-GUI, a training-free framework for GUI grounding that leverages two core strategies: dynamic visual grounding and modality-aware optimization. Instead of treating the GUI as a monolithic image, our method splits the input into textual elements and iconic elements, allowing the model to reason over each modality independently using general-purpose vision-language models. When predictions are ambiguous or incorrect, DiMo-GUI dynamically focuses attention by generating candidate focal regions centered on the model's initial predictions and incrementally zooms into subregions to refine the grounding result. This hierarchical refinement process helps disambiguate visually crowded layouts without the need for additional training or annotations. We evaluate our approach on standard GUI grounding benchmarks and demonstrate consistent improvements over baseline inference pipelines, highlighting the effectiveness of combining modality separation with region-focused reasoning.

This framework preserves both structural and semantic dimensions of tabular data through multimodal reasoning. Experimental evaluation demonstrates TalentMine's superior performance in query answering tasks compared to standard extraction methods. The study also identifies the Claude v3 Haiku model as optimal for talent management applications.

arXiv:2507.00041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In talent management systems, critical information often resides in complex tabular formats, presenting significant retrieval challenges for conventional language models. These challenges are pronounced when processing Talent documentation that requires precise interpretation of tabular relationships for accurate information retrieval and downstream decision-making. Current table extraction methods struggle with semantic understanding, resulting in poor performance when integrated into retrieval-augmented chat applications. This paper identifies a key bottleneck - while structural table information can be extracted, the semantic relationships between tabular elements are lost, causing downstream query failures. To address this, we introduce TalentMine, a novel LLM-enhanced framework that transforms extracted tables into semantically enriched representations. Unlike conventional approaches relying on CSV or text linearization, our method employs specialized multimodal reasoning to preserve both structural and semantic dimensions of tabular data. Experimental evaluation across employee benefits document collections demonstrates TalentMine's superior performance, achieving 100% accuracy in query answering tasks compared to 0% for standard AWS Textract extraction and 40% for AWS Textract Visual Q&amp;A capabilities. Our comparative analysis also reveals that the Claude v3 Haiku model achieves optimal performance for talent management applications. The key contributions of this work include (1) a systematic analysis of semantic information loss in current table extraction pipelines, (2) a novel LLM-based method for semantically enriched table representation, (3) an efficient integration framework for retrieval-augmented systems as end-to-end systems, and (4) comprehensive benchmarks on talent analytics tasks showing substantial improvements across multiple categories.

Summary: 
The article discusses the integration of machine learning in self-driving laboratories (SDL) to enhance discovery processes in scientific and engineering fields. By utilizing FAIR data infrastructure, distributed SDLs can collaborate effectively by sharing experimental data in a centralized database. Researchers contribute raw data to a shared platform, which is then processed using machine learning models and analysis tools. A nanoHUB workflow facilitates sequential optimization through active learning, enabling researchers to define objectives and train ML models in real-time for future experiment selection. The optimization task, inspired by the idea of a "frugal twin," involves finding the optimal combination of food dyes to achieve a target color. The framework allows for easy setup of experiments, data sharing, and exploration of predictive ML models, making it accessible to researchers and students. The tools introduced are versatile and can be extended to various optimization problems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.00048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of machine learning with automated experimentation in self-driving laboratories (SDL) offers a powerful approach to accelerate discovery and optimization tasks in science and engineering applications. When supported by findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data infrastructure, SDLs with overlapping interests can collaborate more effectively. This work presents a distributed SDL implementation built on nanoHUB services for online simulation and FAIR data management. In this framework, geographically dispersed collaborators conducting independent optimization tasks contribute raw experimental data to a shared central database. These researchers can then benefit from analysis tools and machine learning models that automatically update as additional data become available. New data points are submitted through a simple web interface and automatically processed using a nanoHUB Sim2L, which extracts derived quantities and indexes all inputs and outputs in a FAIR data repository called ResultsDB. A separate nanoHUB workflow enables sequential optimization using active learning, where researchers define the optimization objective, and machine learning models are trained on-the-fly with all existing data, guiding the selection of future experiments. Inspired by the concept of ``frugal twin", the optimization task seeks to find the optimal recipe to combine food dyes to achieve the desired target color. With easily accessible and inexpensive materials, researchers and students can set up their own experiments, share data with collaborators, and explore the combination of FAIR data, predictive ML models, and sequential optimization. The tools introduced are generally applicable and can easily be extended to other optimization problems.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel Self-Explainable Zero-shot Human Activity Recognition Network (SEZ-HARN) model for IMU-based HAR. SEZ-HARN addresses the lack of comprehensive datasets and transparency in existing models. It can recognize new activities and provide explanations through skeleton videos. Evaluation on benchmark datasets shows competitive Zero-shot recognition accuracy and realistic explanations. SEZ-HARN achieves a prediction accuracy within 3% of the best black-box model on PAMAP2 and maintains comparable performance on other datasets. The model's transparency and ability to provide understandable explanations make it a valuable advancement in the field of HAR. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.00050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR), which uses data from Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors, has many practical applications in healthcare and assisted living environments. However, its use in real-world scenarios has been limited by the lack of comprehensive IMU-based HAR datasets that cover a wide range of activities and the lack of transparency in existing HAR models. Zero-shot HAR (ZS-HAR) overcomes the data limitations, but current models struggle to explain their decisions, making them less transparent. This paper introduces a novel IMU-based ZS-HAR model called the Self-Explainable Zero-shot Human Activity Recognition Network (SEZ-HARN). It can recognize activities not encountered during training and provide skeleton videos to explain its decision-making process. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed SEZ-HARN on four benchmark datasets PAMAP2, DaLiAc, HTD-MHAD and MHealth and compare its performance against three state-of-the-art black-box ZS-HAR models. The experiment results demonstrate that SEZ-HARN produces realistic and understandable explanations while achieving competitive Zero-shot recognition accuracy. SEZ-HARN achieves a Zero-shot prediction accuracy within 3\% of the best-performing black-box model on PAMAP2 while maintaining comparable performance on the other three datasets.

<div> knowledge distillation, small language models, large language models, reward-guided dataset distillation, student model

Summary:
AdvDistill introduces a reward-guided dataset distillation framework to improve the performance of small language models learning from large language models. This framework incorporates multiple generations of responses from the teacher model for each prompt and assigns rewards based on rule-based verifiers. These rewards, representing weights during training, lead to significant enhancements in student model performance on reasoning tasks. Unlike traditional distillation methods where the student model simply mimics the teacher's responses, AdvDistill offers a more nuanced approach that prioritizes generalizability and computational efficiency. By leveraging rewarding mechanisms in dataset distillation, this study showcases the effectiveness and benefits of integrating incentives into the learning process for small language models. <div>
arXiv:2507.00054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The push to compress and impart the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) into more deployable and efficient Small Language Models (SLMs) has benefited from improvements in knowledge distillation (KD) techniques. These techniques allow a smaller student model to learn from a more capable and larger teacher model's responses. However, distillation often revolves around the student model merely copying the teacher's in-distribution responses, limiting its generalisability. This limitation is amplified on reasoning tasks and can be computationally expensive. In this study, we propose AdvDistill, a reward-guided dataset distillation framework. We utilise multiple generations (responses) from a teacher for each prompt and assign rewards based on rule-based verifiers. These varying and normally distributed rewards serve as weights when training student models. Our methods and their subsequent behavioural analysis demonstrate a significant improvement in student model performance for mathematical and complex reasoning tasks, showcasing the efficacy and benefits of incorporating a rewarding mechanism in dataset distillation processes.

Summary: <br />
The paper discusses the concept of open-endedness in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) research and the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in interpreting image inputs. It introduces VoyagerVision, a multi-modal model that utilizes visual feedback from Minecraft screenshots to create structures within the game environment. VoyagerVision extends the capabilities of the previous model, Voyager, by successfully creating an average of 2.75 unique structures in fifty iterations. The model shows promise in flat worlds, achieving success in half of all building unit tests. However, more complex structures present challenges. Overall, VoyagerVision demonstrates the potential of combining visual inputs with language models to enhance spatial understanding and task performance in AGI systems. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Open-endedness is an active field of research in the pursuit of capable Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), allowing models to pursue tasks of their own choosing. Simultaneously, recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o [9] have allowed such models to be capable of interpreting image inputs. Implementations such as OMNI-EPIC [4] have made use of such features, providing an LLM with pixel data of an agent's POV to parse the environment and allow it to solve tasks. This paper proposes that providing these visual inputs to a model gives it greater ability to interpret spatial environments, and as such, can increase the number of tasks it can successfully perform, extending its open-ended potential. To this aim, this paper proposes VoyagerVision -- a multi-modal model capable of creating structures within Minecraft using screenshots as a form of visual feedback, building on the foundation of Voyager. VoyagerVision was capable of creating an average of 2.75 unique structures within fifty iterations of the system, as Voyager was incapable of this, it is an extension in an entirely new direction. Additionally, in a set of building unit tests VoyagerVision was successful in half of all attempts in flat worlds, with most failures arising in more complex structures.

Summary: 
SAGE-nano, a 4-billion-parameter reasoning model, introduces textbfinverse reasoning, a novel paradigm that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to explain their own reasoning chains post-hoc. By employing a metacognitive structure that reflects back via attention processes, SAGE-nano can identify major decision points and generate explanations for its reasoning choices. Through rigorous testing on various logical reasoning puzzles and benchmarks, SAGE-nano has demonstrated high reasoning accuracy (74.6% on AQUA-RAT) and explanation quality (92.1% human preference score) comparable to models like Claude-3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o. This framework not only improves reasoning performance but also enhances interpretability and transparency in AI systems. By advancing the field of inverse reasoning, this work contributes to AI safety, education, and scientific discovery, creating new avenues for the development of transparent AI systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities at solving complex reasoning tasks with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, but their decision-making processes remain somewhat blackbox. We introduce textbfinverse reasoning, a novel paradigm enabling LLMs to decompose and explain their own reasoning chains post-hoc. Our approach, used in SAGE-nano, a 4-billion-parameter reasoning model, employs a metacognitive structure that reflects back via attention processes to identify major decision points and generate explanations of reasoning choices. While typical CoT approaches are directed towards forward reasoning generation, inverse reasoning provides insight into why specific reasoning chains were selected over others. Through thorough testing of logical reasoning puzzles, math problems and ethical dilemmas from AQUA-RAT, CommonsenseQA, and customized benchmarks, we demonstrate that SAGE-nano is at the cutting edge both on reasoning accuracy (74.6% on AQUA-RAT) and explanation quality (92.1% human preference score) for its task, and offers performance almost on par with models like Claude-3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4o. Our contributions are: (i) the first rigorous framework for LLM self-reflection via inverse reasoning, (ii) a novel metalearning framework to reverse the attention flow, (iii) comprehensive evaluation frameworks for reasoning transparency, and (iv) evidence that increasing reasoning using inverse reasoning improves interpretability along with reasoning performance. Our work creates new avenues for transparent AI systems and closes significant gaps in AI safety, education, and scientific discovery.

Summary: 
The paper discusses the challenge of modernizing legacy software systems due to a lack of documentation and understanding of the original decision logic. A novel pipeline is proposed to extract interpretable decision logic from legacy systems treated as black boxes. The approach utilizes a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to explore the input space and identify critical decision boundaries by rewarding actions that cause meaningful output changes. Counterfactual state transitions are collected and clustered using K-Means, and decision trees are trained on these clusters to extract human-readable rules near the identified boundaries. The effectiveness of the pipeline is demonstrated on dummy legacy systems with varying complexity, showcasing the successful exploration of relevant boundary regions and accurate extraction of core decision logic. This approach provides a promising foundation for generating specifications and test cases during legacy migration.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Modernizing legacy software systems is a critical but challenging task, often hampered by a lack of documentation and understanding of the original system's intricate decision logic. Traditional approaches like behavioral cloning merely replicate input-output behavior without capturing the underlying intent. This paper proposes a novel pipeline to automatically extract interpretable decision logic from legacy systems treated as black boxes. The approach uses a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to explore the input space and identify critical decision boundaries by rewarding actions that cause meaningful changes in the system's output. These counterfactual state transitions, where the output changes, are collected and clustered using K-Means. Decision trees are then trained on these clusters to extract human-readable rules that approximate the system's decision logic near the identified boundaries. I demonstrated the pipeline's effectiveness on three dummy legacy systems with varying complexity, including threshold-based, combined-conditional, and non-linear range logic. Results show that the RL agent successfully focuses exploration on relevant boundary regions, and the extracted rules accurately reflect the core logic of the underlying dummy systems, providing a promising foundation for generating specifications and test cases during legacy migration.

Abstract: Despite the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in education, concerns have emerged about their potential to reduce deep thinking and active learning. This study investigates the impact of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, specifically ChatGPT, on the cognitive engagement of students during academic writing tasks. The study employed an experimental design with participants randomly assigned to either an AI-assisted (ChatGPT) or a non-assisted (control) condition. Participants completed a structured argumentative writing task followed by a cognitive engagement scale (CES), the CES-AI, developed to assess mental effort, attention, deep processing, and strategic thinking. The results revealed significantly lower cognitive engagement scores in the ChatGPT group compared to the control group. These findings suggest that AI assistance may lead to cognitive offloading. The study contributes to the growing body of literature on the psychological implications of AI in education and raises important questions about the integration of such tools into academic practice. It calls for pedagogical strategies that promote active, reflective engagement with AI-generated content to avoid compromising self-regulated learning and deep cognitive involvement of students.

Abstract: With the increasing interest in deploying Artificial Intelligence in medicine, we previously introduced HAIM (Holistic AI in Medicine), a framework that fuses multimodal data to solve downstream clinical tasks. However, HAIM uses data in a task-agnostic manner and lacks explainability. To address these limitations, we introduce xHAIM (Explainable HAIM), a novel framework leveraging Generative AI to enhance both prediction and explainability through four structured steps: (1) automatically identifying task-relevant patient data across modalities, (2) generating comprehensive patient summaries, (3) using these summaries for improved predictive modeling, and (4) providing clinical explanations by linking predictions to patient-specific medical knowledge. Evaluated on the HAIM-MIMIC-MM dataset, xHAIM improves average AUC from 79.9% to 90.3% across chest pathology and operative tasks. Importantly, xHAIM transforms AI from a black-box predictor into an explainable decision support system, enabling clinicians to interactively trace predictions back to relevant patient data, bridging AI advancements with clinical utility.

Abstract: This paper reviews the current progress in applying machine learning (ML) tools to solve NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, with a focus on routing problems such as the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and the vehicle routing problem (VRP). Due to the inherent complexity of these problems, exact algorithms often require excessive computational time to find optimal solutions, while heuristics can only provide approximate solutions without guaranteeing optimality. With the recent success of machine learning models, there is a growing trend in proposing and implementing diverse ML techniques to enhance the resolution of these challenging routing problems. We propose a taxonomy categorizing ML-based routing methods into construction-based and improvement-based approaches, highlighting their applicability to various problem characteristics. This review aims to integrate traditional OR methods with state-of-the-art ML techniques, providing a structured framework to guide future research and address emerging VRP variants.

<div> Keywords: ASTRO, Autoregressive Search-Taught Reasoner, language models, reinforcement learning, search behavior<br />
Summary:<br />
ASTRO is a framework that trains language models to reason like search algorithms, incorporating self-reflection, backtracking, and exploration. By utilizing a synthetic dataset from Monte Carlo Tree Search, ASTRO helps non-reasoner models like Llama 3 develop structured search behavior. This approach involves converting search traces into natural language chain-of-thoughts, enabling models to learn from successes and failures. Through fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, ASTRO boosts the reasoning capabilities of Llama 3 models, leading to significant performance improvements on mathematical problem-solving tasks. The results show a 16.0% increase on MATH-500, 26.9% on AMC 2023, and 20.0% on AIME 2024, particularly enhancing performance on complex problems requiring iterative correction. This study showcases how incorporating search-inspired training can effectively enhance the reasoning abilities of open language models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We introduce ASTRO, the "Autoregressive Search-Taught Reasoner", a framework for training language models to reason like search algorithms, explicitly leveraging self-reflection, backtracking, and exploration in their outputs. Recently, training large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL) has led to the advent of reasoning models with greatly enhanced reasoning capabilities. Open-source replications of reasoning models, while successful, build upon models that already exhibit strong reasoning capabilities along with search behavior observed even before RL. As a result, it is yet unclear how to boost the reasoning capabilities of other non-reasoner models including Llama 3. ASTRO teaches such models to internalize structured search behavior through a synthetic dataset derived from Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) over mathematical problem-solving trajectories. By converting search traces into natural language chain-of-thoughts that capture both successes and recoveries from failure, ASTRO bootstraps models with a rich prior for exploration during RL. We finetune our models on these search-derived traces and further improve performance via RL with verifiable rewards. We apply ASTRO to the Llama 3 family of models and achieve absolute performance gains of 16.0% on MATH-500, 26.9% on AMC 2023, and 20.0% on AIME 2024, especially improving upon challenging problems that require iterative correction. Our results demonstrate that search-inspired training offers a principled way to instill robust reasoning capabilities into open LLMs.

<div> math reasoning, large language models, transfer learning, reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning

Summary:<br />
- Math reasoning has shown significant progress in large language models, surpassing human-level performance on benchmarks such as MATH and AIME.
- However, the gains in math may not necessarily reflect broader problem-solving abilities but rather could be due to narrow overfitting.
- Evaluation of over 20 reasoning-tuned models across various tasks indicates that models excelling in math struggle to transfer their success to other domains.
- Controlled experiments on Qwen3-14B models reveal that reinforcement learning-tuned models exhibit better generalization across domains compared to supervised fine-tuning-tuned models.
- Analysis suggests that supervised fine-tuning induces significant representation and output drift, while reinforcement learning preserves general-domain structure. These findings call for a reevaluation of standard post-training methods, especially the reliance on supervised fine-tuning for advancing reasoning models.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Math reasoning has become the poster child of progress in large language models (LLMs), with new models rapidly surpassing human-level performance on benchmarks like MATH and AIME. But as math leaderboards improve week by week, it is worth asking: do these gains reflect broader problem-solving ability or just narrow overfitting? To answer this question, we evaluate over 20 open-weight reasoning-tuned models across a broad suite of tasks, including math, scientific QA, agent planning, coding, and standard instruction-following. We surprisingly find that most models that succeed in math fail to transfer their gains to other domains. To rigorously study this phenomenon, we conduct controlled experiments on Qwen3-14B models using math-only data but different tuning methods. We find that reinforcement learning (RL)-tuned models generalize well across domains, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-tuned models often forget general capabilities. Latent-space representation and token-space distribution shift analyses reveal that SFT induces substantial representation and output drift, while RL preserves general-domain structure. Our results suggest a need to rethink standard post-training recipes, particularly the reliance on SFT-distilled data for advancing reasoning models.

Summary: 
In this paper, the authors propose enhancements to local search for Satisfiability Modulo the Theory of Nonlinear Real Arithmetic (SMT-NRA). They introduce a new two-dimensional cell-jump move called $2d$-cell-jump to improve the existing local search method. The extended local search framework, $2d$-LS, integrates the model constructing satisfiability calculus (MCSAT) framework for increased search efficiency. By implementing the sample-cell projection operator for MCSAT, the efficiency of the search process is further improved by guiding it away from conflicting states in the real domain. Additionally, a hybrid framework for SMT-NRA is designed, combining MCSAT, $2d$-LS, and OpenCAD to enhance search efficiency through information exchange. Experimental results show significant improvements in local search performance, validating the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we advance local search for Satisfiability Modulo the Theory of Nonlinear Real Arithmetic (SMT-NRA for short). First, we introduce a two-dimensional cell-jump move, called \emph{$2d$-cell-jump}, generalizing the key operation, cell-jump, of the local search method for SMT-NRA. Then, we propose an extended local search framework, named \emph{$2d$-LS} (following the local search framework, LS, for SMT-NRA), integrating the model constructing satisfiability calculus (MCSAT) framework to improve search efficiency. To further improve the efficiency of MCSAT, we implement a recently proposed technique called \emph{sample-cell projection operator} for MCSAT, which is well suited for CDCL-style search in the real domain and helps guide the search away from conflicting states. Finally, we design a hybrid framework for SMT-NRA combining MCSAT, $2d$-LS and OpenCAD, to improve search efficiency through information exchange. The experimental results demonstrate improvements in local search performance, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

<div> Keywords: reinforcement learning, large language models, strategic reasoning, chess, knowledge distillation

Summary:
Reinforcement learning (RL) is applied to large language models (LLMs) for strategic reasoning in chess. Using a chess-pretrained action-value network, dense rewards are provided to improve move quality, resembling knowledge distillation. Experimental results show that these dense rewards outperform sparse binary rewards but fall short of expert levels. Ablation studies reveal that the limitations may result from a lack of deep internal understanding of chess in the pretrained models, which RL alone might not fully address. Despite promising outcomes with dense rewards, strategic reasoning in chess for LLMs remains a challenge. This study highlights the importance of incorporating domain-specific knowledge and the complexities involved in enhancing strategic reasoning capabilities in LLMs through RL methods.

<br /><br />Summary: 
Keywords: reinforcement learning, large language models, strategic reasoning, chess, knowledge distillation 
Key points: RL for strategic reasoning in chess with LLMs, dense rewards outperform sparse rewards but fall short of expert levels, deficiency in internal chess understanding limits progress, RL alone may not fully address this limitation, challenges in advancing strategic reasoning capabilities in LLMs. <div>
arXiv:2507.00726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) has shown promise in mathematical reasoning, strategic reasoning for LLMs using RL remains largely unexplored. We investigate whether LLMs can develop strategic reasoning capabilities through RL in chess. To this end, we leverage a chess-pretrained action-value network to provide dense reward on the LLM's output move quality, which can be seen as a form of knowledge distillation. Our experiments show that our distillation-based dense rewards often outperform sparse binary rewards. However, surprisingly, all models plateau far below expert levels. We provide SFT and RL ablations on chess reasoning training and find evidence that this limitation stems from a deficit in the pretrained models' internal understanding of chess--a deficit which RL alone may not be able to fully overcome.

Summary: 
This study addresses the security risks associated with mobile multimodal agents, which face potential jailbreak threats from attackers manipulating agent behaviors to perform sensitive operations. Existing security measures have limitations in detecting risky behaviors across multiple interactions. The research proposes a risk discrimination mechanism that incorporates behavioral sequence information and an automated assisted assessment scheme utilizing a large language model. Through validation on high-risk tasks, the method shows improved recognition of risky behaviors and aids in reducing agent jailbreaking. The study aims to contribute valuable insights for enhancing security risk modeling and protection in multimodal intelligent agent systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.00841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the wide application of multimodal foundation models in intelligent agent systems, scenarios such as mobile device control, intelligent assistant interaction, and multimodal task execution are gradually relying on such large model-driven agents. However, the related systems are also increasingly exposed to potential jailbreak risks. Attackers may induce the agents to bypass the original behavioral constraints through specific inputs, and then trigger certain risky and sensitive operations, such as modifying settings, executing unauthorized commands, or impersonating user identities, which brings new challenges to system security. Existing security measures for intelligent agents still have limitations when facing complex interactions, especially in detecting potentially risky behaviors across multiple rounds of conversations or sequences of tasks. In addition, an efficient and consistent automated methodology to assist in assessing and determining the impact of such risks is currently lacking. This work explores the security issues surrounding mobile multimodal agents, attempts to construct a risk discrimination mechanism by incorporating behavioral sequence information, and designs an automated assisted assessment scheme based on a large language model. Through preliminary validation in several representative high-risk tasks, the results show that the method can improve the recognition of risky behaviors to some extent and assist in reducing the probability of agents being jailbroken. We hope that this study can provide some valuable references for the security risk modeling and protection of multimodal intelligent agent systems.

Summary: 
This paper discusses the pursuit of achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and the limitations faced by current models like GPT-4.5 and DeepSeek. It emphasizes the importance of modular reasoning, persistent memory, and multi-agent coordination in developing AGI systems. The rise of Agentic RAG frameworks, which combine retrieval, planning, and dynamic tool use, is highlighted for enabling more adaptive behavior. Generalization strategies such as information compression, test-time adaptation, and training-free methods are crucial for flexible intelligence. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are seen as evolving interfaces for embodied understanding and task completion, not just perception modules. The integration of memory and reasoning, along with advances in neurosymbolic systems and reinforcement learning, is bridging the gap between statistical learning and goal-directed cognition. The paper also identifies scientific, technical, and ethical challenges in the journey towards achieving AGI.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.00951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can machines truly think, reason and act in domains like humans? This enduring question continues to shape the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Despite the growing capabilities of models such as GPT-4.5, DeepSeek, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Phi-4, and Grok 3, which exhibit multimodal fluency and partial reasoning, these systems remain fundamentally limited by their reliance on token-level prediction and lack of grounded agency. This paper offers a cross-disciplinary synthesis of AGI development, spanning artificial intelligence, cognitive neuroscience, psychology, generative models, and agent-based systems. We analyze the architectural and cognitive foundations of general intelligence, highlighting the role of modular reasoning, persistent memory, and multi-agent coordination. In particular, we emphasize the rise of Agentic RAG frameworks that combine retrieval, planning, and dynamic tool use to enable more adaptive behavior. We discuss generalization strategies, including information compression, test-time adaptation, and training-free methods, as critical pathways toward flexible, domain-agnostic intelligence. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are reexamined not just as perception modules but as evolving interfaces for embodied understanding and collaborative task completion. We also argue that true intelligence arises not from scale alone but from the integration of memory and reasoning: an orchestration of modular, interactive, and self-improving components where compression enables adaptive behavior. Drawing on advances in neurosymbolic systems, reinforcement learning, and cognitive scaffolding, we explore how recent architectures begin to bridge the gap between statistical learning and goal-directed cognition. Finally, we identify key scientific, technical, and ethical challenges on the path to AGI.

Summary: 
Autonomous agents powered by large language models are becoming increasingly common in various assistive tasks, highlighting the importance of ensuring their safe and reliable behavior. To address this need, a novel technique called CIP leveraging causal influence diagrams (CIDs) has been introduced. CIDs offer a structured way to represent cause-and-effect relationships, enabling agents to anticipate harmful outcomes and make safer decisions. The approach involves initializing a CID based on task specifications, guiding agent interactions using the CID, and iteratively refining the CID based on observed behaviors and outcomes. Experimental results show that this method effectively enhances safety in tasks involving code execution and mobile device control. CIP demonstrates promising potential in mitigating risks and improving the reliability of autonomous agents powered by large language models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: As autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) continue to demonstrate potential across various assistive tasks, ensuring their safe and reliable behavior is crucial for preventing unintended consequences. In this work, we introduce CIP, a novel technique that leverages causal influence diagrams (CIDs) to identify and mitigate risks arising from agent decision-making. CIDs provide a structured representation of cause-and-effect relationships, enabling agents to anticipate harmful outcomes and make safer decisions. Our approach consists of three key steps: (1) initializing a CID based on task specifications to outline the decision-making process, (2) guiding agent interactions with the environment using the CID, and (3) iteratively refining the CID based on observed behaviors and outcomes. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively enhances safety in both code execution and mobile device control tasks.

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but suffer from information spreading, which is reframed as an information-theoretic communication issue. To address memory problems in LLMs, HDRAM (Holographically Defined Random Access Memory) is introduced, treating transformer latent space as a spread-spectrum channel. HDRAM uses hypertokens, structured symbolic codes, error-correcting codes (ECC), holographic computing, and quantum-inspired search to recover distributed information through despreading. It enables efficient key-value operations and Grover-style search in latent space. HDRAM integrates ECC, compressed sensing, and Krylov subspace alignment to significantly improve associative retrieval without changing the architecture, showcasing how Classical-Holographic-Quantum-inspired (CHQ) principles can bolster transformer architectures. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities but suffer from apparent precision loss, reframed here as information spreading. This reframing shifts the problem from computational precision to an information-theoretic communication issue. We address the K:V and V:K memory problem in LLMs by introducing HDRAM (Holographically Defined Random Access Memory), a symbolic memory framework treating transformer latent space as a spread-spectrum channel. Built upon hypertokens, structured symbolic codes integrating classical error-correcting codes (ECC), holographic computing, and quantum-inspired search, HDRAM recovers distributed information through principled despreading. These phase-coherent memory addresses enable efficient key-value operations and Grover-style search in latent space. By combining ECC grammar with compressed sensing and Krylov subspace alignment, HDRAM significantly improves associative retrieval without architectural changes, demonstrating how Classical-Holographic-Quantum-inspired (CHQ) principles can fortify transformer architectures.

It quantifies uncertainty and allows abstention based on truth, falsity, and indeterminacy components. The system flags predictions with high indeterminacy for review using global and adaptive thresholds. Evaluation on IoT-CAD dataset showed 97% accuracy, with misclassified samples having higher indeterminacy. Indeterminacy aids in targeted review, especially in edge deployments.

Abstract: This paper presents NeutroSENSE, a neutrosophic-enhanced ensemble framework for interpretable intrusion detection in IoT environments. By integrating Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression with neutrosophic logic, the system decomposes prediction confidence into truth (T), falsity (F), and indeterminacy (I) components, enabling uncertainty quantification and abstention. Predictions with high indeterminacy are flagged for review using both global and adaptive, class-specific thresholds. Evaluated on the IoT-CAD dataset, NeutroSENSE achieved 97% accuracy, while demonstrating that misclassified samples exhibit significantly higher indeterminacy (I = 0.62) than correct ones (I = 0.24). The use of indeterminacy as a proxy for uncertainty enables informed abstention and targeted review-particularly valuable in edge deployments. Figures and tables validate the correlation between I-scores and error likelihood, supporting more trustworthy, human-in-the-loop AI decisions. This work shows that neutrosophic logic enhances both accuracy and explainability, providing a practical foundation for trust-aware AI in edge and fog-based IoT security systems.

Summary:
The article discusses the computational, energy, and financial resources required for large language models (LLMs) during training and deployment, with a focus on inference costs. It introduces directed stochastic skill search (DS3) as a framework for efficient inference through a learned skill graph. By analyzing different inference strategies like chain-of-thought (CoT) and tree-of-thought (ToT), the study derives closed-form expressions for task success and compute cost. The framework extends existing models to incorporate inference and empirically observed patterns such as linear accuracy scaling and variation in preferred inference strategies are theoretically recovered. The framework also captures emergent behaviors like reasoning-induced changes in performance and best-of-N (BoN) and majority voting behavior. Ultimately, the framework provides a deeper theoretical understanding of training-inference interdependencies to support algorithmic design and resource allocation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demand considerable computational, energy, and financial resources during both training and deployment. While scaling laws for training have guided much of the field's recent progress, inference costs now represent a significant and growing component of the overall resource burden, particularly for reasoning-focused models. Existing characterizations of compute-optimality that consider model size, dataset size, and inference tokens in isolation or in fixed combinations risk overlooking more efficient operating points. We introduce directed stochastic skill search (DS3), a general framework that represents inference as stochastic traversal over a learned skill graph. From a simplified yet expressive instantiation, we derive closed-form expressions for task success and compute cost across a wide range of inference strategies -- including chain-of-thought (CoT) and tree-of-thought (ToT) -- enabling comparative analysis as a function of task difficulty and model capability. To that end, we extend a prior first-principles tripartite graph framework of LLM training to incorporate inference, and separately bridge DS3 with empirical methods that characterize LLM scaling behavior. We theoretically recover empirically observed patterns, including: linear accuracy scaling with logarithmic compute; variation in preferred inference strategies as a function of task difficulty and model capability; emergent behavior elicited by reasoning even when performance plateaus under parameter scaling; and both best-of-N (BoN) and majority voting behavior captured within a unified analytical framework. By explicitly characterizing training-inference interdependencies, our framework deepens theoretical understanding and supports principled algorithmic design and resource allocation.

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel educational framework that integrates generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) platforms like ChatGPT and Claude into laboratory activities for undergraduate students. Instead of relying uncritically on large language models, the proposed pedagogical model encourages students to treat GenAI as both a research subject and a cognitive tool. In this framework, students create discipline-specific prompts and assess GenAI-generated responses in various modalities. A pilot study in a general astronomy course for non-science majors showed high engagement levels and critical reflection among students, who continued the activity outside of class and presented their findings at a research symposium. The study emphasizes the significance of structured AI interactions in education and suggests that combining GenAI with reflective assessment methods can enhance learning outcomes. The model presented is replicable and adaptable to various scientific disciplines.

Abstract: Efficient elevator traffic management in large buildings is critical for minimizing passenger travel times and energy consumption. Because heuristic- or pattern-detection-based controllers struggle with the stochastic and combinatorial nature of dispatching, we model the six-elevator, fifteen-floor system at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam as a Markov Decision Process and train an end-to-end Reinforcement Learning (RL) Elevator Group Control System (EGCS). Key innovations include a novel action space encoding to handle the combinatorial complexity of elevator dispatching, the introduction of infra-steps to model continuous passenger arrivals, and a tailored reward signal to improve learning efficiency. In addition, we explore various ways to adapt the discounting factor to the infra-step formulation. We investigate RL architectures based on Dueling Double Deep Q-learning, showing that the proposed RL-based EGCS adapts to fluctuating traffic patterns, learns from a highly stochastic environment, and thereby outperforms a traditional rule-based algorithm.

Summary:<br />
- A new training method, CMI minimized (CMIM), is proposed to create undistillable deep neural networks (DNNs) by minimizing conditional mutual information (CMI) values of output probability distributions.
- The CMIM model outperforms DNN models trained with cross entropy alone and is resistant to knowledge distillation (KD) methods.
- Undistillable DNNs have highly concentrated output probability distributions for each label, making them difficult to extract knowledge from.
- The CMIM model collapses clusters of output probabilities, making it challenging to distill information.
- By minimizing CMI values during training, the CMIM model becomes undistillable and demonstrates improved prediction accuracy compared to models trained with conventional methods. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: A deep neural network (DNN) is said to be undistillable if, when used as a black-box input-output teacher, it cannot be distilled through knowledge distillation (KD). In this case, the distilled student (referred to as the knockoff student) does not outperform a student trained independently with label smoothing (LS student) in terms of prediction accuracy. To protect intellectual property of DNNs, it is desirable to build undistillable DNNs. To this end, it is first observed that an undistillable DNN may have the trait that each cluster of its output probability distributions in response to all sample instances with the same label should be highly concentrated to the extent that each cluster corresponding to each label should ideally collapse into one probability distribution. Based on this observation and by measuring the concentration of each cluster in terms of conditional mutual information (CMI), a new training method called CMI minimized (CMIM) method is proposed, which trains a DNN by jointly minimizing the conventional cross entropy (CE) loss and the CMI values of all temperature scaled clusters across the entire temperature spectrum. The resulting CMIM model is shown, by extensive experiments, to be undistillable by all tested KD methods existing in the literature. That is, the knockoff students distilled by these KD methods from the CMIM model underperform the respective LS students. In addition, the CMIM model is also shown to performs better than the model trained with the CE loss alone in terms of their own prediction accuracy.

<div> Seasonal-trend decomposition, masked time-series modeling, entangled patterns, period masking, contrastive learning <br />
Summary:<br />
Forecasting complex time series is crucial for various industrial applications. Traditional masked time-series modeling may learn spurious temporal patterns due to ignoring semantic structure. To address this, a novel framework called ST-MTM is proposed, incorporating seasonal-trend decomposition and innovative masking methods. ST-MTM leverages period masking for seasonal components and sub-series masking for trends to capture distinct temporal semantics effectively. It introduces a contrastive learning task to enhance contextual consistency among multiple masked seasonal representations. Experimental results demonstrate superior forecasting performance of ST-MTM compared to existing methods. The framework effectively pre-trains models on intricate temporal dependencies, improving forecasting accuracy through the decomposition of entangled patterns. <div>

Abstract: Forecasting complex time series is an important yet challenging problem that involves various industrial applications. Recently, masked time-series modeling has been proposed to effectively model temporal dependencies for forecasting by reconstructing masked segments from unmasked ones. However, since the semantic information in time series is involved in intricate temporal variations generated by multiple time series components, simply masking a raw time series ignores the inherent semantic structure, which may cause MTM to learn spurious temporal patterns present in the raw data. To capture distinct temporal semantics, we show that masked modeling techniques should address entangled patterns through a decomposition approach. Specifically, we propose ST-MTM, a masked time-series modeling framework with seasonal-trend decomposition, which includes a novel masking method for the seasonal-trend components that incorporates different temporal variations from each component. ST-MTM uses a period masking strategy for seasonal components to produce multiple masked seasonal series based on inherent multi-periodicity and a sub-series masking strategy for trend components to mask temporal regions that share similar variations. The proposed masking method presents an effective pre-training task for learning intricate temporal variations and dependencies. Additionally, ST-MTM introduces a contrastive learning task to support masked modeling by enhancing contextual consistency among multiple masked seasonal representations. Experimental results show that our proposed ST-MTM achieves consistently superior forecasting performance compared to existing masked modeling, contrastive learning, and supervised forecasting methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results on static code-generation benchmarks, but real-world software development unfolds as a continuous stream of evolving issues, fixes, and feature requests. We introduce SWE-Bench-CL, a novel continual learning benchmark built on the human-verified SWE-Bench Verified dataset introduced by OpenAI and Princeton-NLP in 2024. By organizing GitHub issues into chronologically ordered sequences that reflect natural repository evolution, SWE-Bench-CL enables direct evaluation of an agent's ability to accumulate experience, transfer knowledge across tasks, and resist catastrophic forgetting. We complement the dataset with (i) a preliminary analysis of inter-task structural similarity and contextual sensitivity, (ii) an interactive LangGraph-based evaluation framework augmented with a FAISS-backed semantic memory module, and (iii) a suite of specialized continual learning metrics -- including average accuracy, forgetting, forward/backward transfer, tool-use efficiency, and a generalized Composite Continual Learning Score and CL-F-beta score -- to capture the stability-plasticity trade-off. We outline a rigorous experimental protocol comparing memory-enabled and memory-disabled agents across diverse Python repositories.

The paper proposes a defensive strategy for transformer-based modulation classification systems to address vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. A novel vision transformer architecture is introduced with an adversarial indicator (AdvI) token for attack detection.

Abstract: The remarkable success of transformers across various fields such as natural language processing and computer vision has paved the way for their applications in automatic modulation classification, a critical component in the communication systems of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, it has been observed that transformer-based classification of radio signals is susceptible to subtle yet sophisticated adversarial attacks. To address this issue, we have developed a defensive strategy for transformer-based modulation classification systems to counter such adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel vision transformer (ViT) architecture by introducing a new concept known as adversarial indicator (AdvI) token to detect adversarial attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose an AdvI token in ViT to defend against adversarial attacks. Integrating an adversarial training method with a detection mechanism using AdvI token, we combine a training time defense and running time defense in a unified neural network model, which reduces architectural complexity of the system compared to detecting adversarial perturbations using separate models. We investigate into the operational principles of our method by examining the attention mechanism. We show the proposed AdvI token acts as a crucial element within the ViT, influencing attention weights and thereby highlighting regions or features in the input data that are potentially suspicious or anomalous. Through experimental results, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses several competitive methods in handling white-box attack scenarios, including those utilizing the fast gradient method, projected gradient descent attacks and basic iterative method.

Summary: 
The paper introduces an efficient fine-tuning method called GRFT that updates rows or columns of the weight matrix based on gradients, reducing storage overhead and improving parameter selection efficiency. The approach outperforms existing methods like GPS, Adapter Tuning, and LoRA, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Large pre-trained models have demonstrated extensive applications across various fields. However, fine-tuning these models for specific downstream tasks demands significant computational resources and storage. One fine-tuning method, gradient-based parameter selection (GPS), focuses on fine-tuning only the parameters with high gradients in each neuron, thereby reducing the number of training parameters. Nevertheless, this approach increases computational resource requirements and storage demands. In this paper, we propose an efficient gradient-based and regularized fine-tuning method (GRFT) that updates the rows or columns of the weight matrix. We theoretically demonstrate that the rows or columns with the highest sum of squared gradients are optimal for updating. This strategy effectively reduces storage overhead and improves the efficiency of parameter selection. Additionally, we incorporate regularization to enhance knowledge transfer from the pre-trained model. GRFT achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods such as GPS, Adapter Tuning, and LoRA. Notably, GRFT requires updating only 1.22% and 0.30% of the total parameters on FGVC and VTAB datasets, respectively, demonstrating its high efficiency and effectiveness. The source code will be released soon.

Summary:<br />
The article presents a unified theoretical framework that connects Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and preference learning in Large Language Model (LLM) post-training. It shows that both SFT and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) operate within the same optimal policy-reward subspace, with SFT as a form of implicit reward learning. A limitation in conventional SFT is identified, where the KL divergence term remains constant during optimization, hindering model updates. A learning rate reduction approach is proposed to overcome this limitation, leading to performance improvements in instruction following tasks. Alternative SFT objectives derived from f-divergence functions are shown to enhance post-DPO model performance. The article also extends the theoretical relationship between LLM logits and Q-functions from preference learning to the SFT context, with mathematical derivations and experimental validation.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Post-training processes are essential phases in grounding pre-trained language models to real-world tasks, with learning from demonstrations or preference signals playing a crucial role in this adaptation. We present a unified theoretical framework bridging Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and preference learning in Large Language Model (LLM) post-training. Through rigorous mathematical derivation, we demonstrate that both SFT and preference learning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) operate within the same optimal policy-reward subspace, with SFT representing a special case of implicit reward learning. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation in conventional SFT: the KL divergence term in distribution matching becomes constant with respect to the policy during optimization, failing to constrain model updates. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective learning rate reduction approach that yields significant performance improvements (up to \textbf{25\%} relative gain and \textbf{6\%} absolute win rate increase in instruction following tasks. Additionally, we derive alternative SFT objectives from various f-divergence functions that preserve the KL term during optimization, further enhancing post-DPO model performance. Finally, we extend the theoretical relationship between LLM logits and Q-functions from preference learning to the SFT context, providing mathematical derivations and experimental validation.

Summary:
Three quantum-inspired data encoding strategies, Instance Level Strategy (ILS), Global Discrete Strategy (GDS), and Class Conditional Value Strategy (CCVS), are proposed and evaluated for transforming classical data into quantum data in classical machine learning models. Each strategy has different approaches to encoding data, impacting encoding efficiency, correctness, model accuracy, and computational cost. The Instance Level Strategy treats each row independently, the Global Discrete Strategy maps all unique feature values uniformly, and the Class Conditional Value Strategy encodes unique values for each class. By assessing trade-offs between encoding time, precision, and predictive performance, insights are provided for optimizing quantum-inspired data transformations in classical machine learning workflows. This study contributes to the understanding of the impact of quantum data encoding strategies on classification tasks. <div>

Abstract: In this study, we propose, evaluate and compare three quantum inspired data encoding strategies, Instance Level Strategy (ILS), Global Discrete Strategy (GDS) and Class Conditional Value Strategy (CCVS), for transforming classical data into quantum data for use in pure classical machine learning models. The primary objective is to reduce high encoding time while ensuring correct encoding values and analyzing their impact on classification performance. The Instance Level Strategy treats each row of dataset independently; mimics local quantum states. Global Discrete Value Based encoding strategy maps all unique feature values across the full dataset to quantum states uniformly. In contrast, the Class conditional Value based encoding strategy encodes unique values separately for each class, preserving class dependent information.
  We apply these encoding strategies to a classification task and assess their impact on en-coding efficiency, correctness, model accuracy, and computational cost. By analyzing the trade offs between encoding time, precision, and predictive performance, this study provides insights into optimizing quantum inspired data transformations for classical machine learning workflows.

Abstract: With the growing demand for novel materials, machine learning-driven inverse design methods face significant challenges in reconciling the high-dimensional materials composition space with limited experimental data. Existing approaches suffer from two major limitations: (I) machine learning models often lack reliability in high-dimensional spaces, leading to prediction biases during the design process; (II) these models fail to effectively incorporate domain expert knowledge, limiting their capacity to support knowledge-guided inverse design. To address these challenges, we introduce AIMatDesign, a reinforcement learning framework that addresses these limitations by augmenting experimental data using difference-based algorithms to build a trusted experience pool, accelerating model convergence. To enhance model reliability, an automated refinement strategy guided by large language models (LLMs) dynamically corrects prediction inconsistencies, reinforcing alignment between reward signals and state value functions. Additionally, a knowledge-based reward function leverages expert domain rules to improve stability and efficiency during training. Our experiments demonstrate that AIMatDesign significantly surpasses traditional machine learning and reinforcement learning methods in discovery efficiency, convergence speed, and success rates. Among the numerous candidates proposed by AIMatDesign, experimental synthesis of representative Zr-based alloys yielded a top-performing BMG with 1.7GPa yield strength and 10.2\% elongation, closely matching predictions. Moreover, the framework accurately captured the trend of yield strength variation with composition, demonstrating its reliability and potential for closed-loop materials discovery.

Abstract: Learning the underlying dynamics from data with deep neural networks has shown remarkable potential in modeling various complex physical dynamics. However, current approaches are constrained in their ability to make reliable predictions in a specific domain and struggle with generalizing to unseen systems that are governed by the same general dynamics but differ in environmental characteristics. In this work, we formulate a parameter-efficient method, Fourier Neural Simulator for Dynamical Adaptation (FNSDA), that can readily generalize to new dynamics via adaptation in the Fourier space. Specifically, FNSDA identifies the shareable dynamics based on the known environments using an automatic partition in Fourier modes and learns to adjust the modes specific for each new environment by conditioning on low-dimensional latent systematic parameters for efficient generalization. We evaluate our approach on four representative families of dynamic systems, and the results show that FNSDA can achieve superior or competitive generalization performance compared to existing methods with a significantly reduced parameter cost.

Summary:
The article discusses the importance of evaluating the safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications, particularly in the face of adversarial prompts. Existing manual safety benchmarks are limited in adaptability and topic coverage, necessitating the development of more dynamic evaluation methods. The proposed Reality-Oriented Safety Evaluation (ROSE) framework leverages multi-objective reinforcement learning to generate diverse and contextually rich adversarial prompts for LLM testing. Experiments demonstrate ROSE's superiority in uncovering safety vulnerabilities in advanced LLMs, with significant enhancements in evaluation metrics. By addressing the shortcomings of current automated prompt generation methods and emphasizing real-world contextualization, ROSE offers a more practical approach to evaluating the safety of LLMs.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.00026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as black-box components in real-world applications, evaluating their safety-especially under adversarial prompting-has become critical. Arguably, effective safety evaluations should be adaptive, evolving with LLM capabilities, and also cover a broad spectrum of harmful topics and real-world scenarios to fully expose potential vulnerabilities. Existing manual safety benchmarks, built on handcrafted adversarial prompts, are limited by their static nature and the intensive labor required to update them, making it difficult to keep pace with rapidly advancing LLMs. In contrast, automated adversarial prompt generation offers a promising path toward adaptive evaluation. However, current methods often suffer from insufficient adversarial topic coverage (topic-level diversity) and weak alignment with real-world contexts. These shortcomings stem from the exploration-exploitation dilemma in black-box optimization and a lack of real-world contextualization, resulting in adversarial prompts that are both topically narrow and scenario-repetitive. To address these issues, we propose Reality-Oriented Safety Evaluation (ROSE), a novel framework that uses multi-objective reinforcement learning to fine-tune an adversarial LLM for generating topically diverse and contextually rich adversarial prompts. Experiments show that ROSE outperforms existing methods in uncovering safety vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art LLMs, with notable improvements in integrated evaluation metrics. We hope ROSE represents a step toward more practical and reality-oriented safety evaluation of LLMs. WARNING: This paper contains examples of potentially harmful text.

Experimental results demonstrate that the hierarchical design of HiT-JEPA produces richer, multi-scale representations, enhancing trajectory similarity computation.

Abstract: The representation of urban trajectory data plays a critical role in effectively analyzing spatial movement patterns. Despite considerable progress, the challenge of designing trajectory representations that can capture diverse and complementary information remains an open research problem. Existing methods struggle in incorporating trajectory fine-grained details and high-level summary in a single model, limiting their ability to attend to both long-term dependencies while preserving local nuances. To address this, we propose HiT-JEPA (Hierarchical Interactions of Trajectory Semantics via a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture), a unified framework for learning multi-scale urban trajectory representations across semantic abstraction levels. HiT-JEPA adopts a three-layer hierarchy that progressively captures point-level fine-grained details, intermediate patterns, and high-level trajectory abstractions, enabling the model to integrate both local dynamics and global semantics in one coherent structure. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets for trajectory similarity computation show that HiT-JEPA's hierarchical design yields richer, multi-scale representations.

The LoRA-Mixer framework addresses limitations in adapting large language models to multiple tasks by integrating low-rank adaptation (LoRA) experts into a modular mixture-of-experts (MoE) design. The framework replaces projection matrices with dynamically routed, task-specific LoRA experts, ensuring compatibility with various foundation models. It supports joint optimization of experts and routing mechanisms or deployment of pre-trained LoRA modules. An adaptive Specialization Balance Loss (SBL) optimizes expert balance and task alignment. Extensive experiments show significant improvements in performance on benchmark datasets, with LoRA-Mixer outperforming state-of-the-art methods with fewer parameters. <div>

Abstract: Recent efforts to combine low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with mixture-of-experts (MoE) for adapting large language models (LLMs) to multiple tasks still exhibit prevailing limitations: they either swap entire attention/feed-forward layers for switch experts or bolt on parallel expert branches, diluting parameter efficiency and task fidelity. We propose the LoRA-Mixer, a modular and lightweight MoE framework that integrates LoRA experts. Our core innovation lies in replacing the projection matrices of the attention module's input/output linear layers with dynamically routed, task-specific LoRA experts. This design ensures seamless compatibility with diverse foundation models, including transformers and state space models (SSMs), by leveraging their inherent linear projection structures. The framework supports two operational paradigms: (1) joint optimization of LoRA experts and routing mechanisms via a novel hard-soft routing strategy, or (2) direct deployment of pre-trained, frozen LoRA modules sourced from external repositories. To enable robust router training with limited data while ensuring stable routing decisions and maximizing expert reuse, we introduce an adaptive Specialization Balance Loss (SBL) that jointly optimizes expert balance and task-specific alignment. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets, including MedQA, CoLA, SST-2, GSM8K, ARC-E, ARC-C, and HumanEval, demonstrate the effectiveness of LoRA-Mixer. On datasets such as GSM8K, HumanEval, and MedQA, LoRA-Mixer achieves significant improvements of 7.61%, 4.88%, and 3.08% over the base models, respectively. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, LoRA-Mixer achieves additional improvements of 1.09%, 1.45%, and 1.68%, respectively, using only 48% of the parameters, demonstrating its efficiency and strong performance.

Our approach augments a Deep Q-Network (DQN) with a contextual bandit module that learns to choose optimal action repetition rates based on state contexts. Experiments on Atari 2600 games demonstrate significant performance improvements over static duration baselines, highlighting the efficacy of adaptive temporal abstractions in DRL. This paradigm offers a scalable solution for real-time applications like gaming and robotics, where dynamic action durations are critical.

<div> memory consolidation, knowledge tracing, Hebbian memory, continual learning, personalized learning

Summary:
KUL-KT is a biologically inspired architecture for knowledge tracing that combines Hebbian memory encoding with gradient-based consolidation. It introduces innovations such as time-decaying Hebbian memory updates and the Loss-aligned Internal Target method for ideal internal state computation without backpropagation through time. The architecture includes a fast Hebbian memory and a slower linear network for few-shot personalization and natural forgetting. Operating in embedding space, KUL-KT supports structured and unstructured inputs, outperforming strong baselines on ten public knowledge tracing benchmarks. In a classroom deployment, it improved learner-perceived helpfulness and reduced difficulty. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of Hebbian decay and LIT for continual adaptation. Compared to a graph-based model, KUL-KT trained faster and used significantly less memory, making it a memory-efficient framework for personalized learning at scale.

Abstract: We introduce KUL-KT, a biologically inspired architecture for knowledge tracing (KT), combining Hebbian memory encoding with gradient-based consolidation in a scalable, input-agnostic framework. KUL-KT adapts the principle of memory consolidation in neural systems, to student modeling by introducing two key innovations: (i) a time-decaying Hebbian memory update that enables graceful forgetting, and (ii) a novel Loss-aligned Internal Target (LIT) method to compute an ideal internal state, allowing continual learning without backpropagation through time. The architecture consists of a fast Hebbian memory that captures each learner interaction via a single associative update, and a slower linear network that consolidates recalled samples through gradient descent. This design enables few-shot personalization and natural forgetting without storing raw data or relying on large cohort training. Operating entirely in embedding space, KUL-KT supports both structured (tabular) and unstructured (short-answer) inputs. Empirically, KUL-KT outperforms strong baselines on ten public KT benchmarks in rank-sensitive metrics such as nDCG and Recall@10. In a classroom deployment, KUL-KT personalized quizzes from short-answer data, leading to improved learner-perceived helpfulness and reduced difficulty (p < 0.05). Ablation studies confirm that Hebbian decay and LIT are critical for continual adaptation. Compared to a strong graph-based KT model, KUL-KT trains 1.75x faster and uses 99.01\% less memory. These results position KUL-KT as a biologically grounded, memory-efficient, and input-flexible framework for personalized learning at scale.

- Frame sub-sampling can lead to loss of key frames or inclusion of redundant information affecting model performance.
- Proposed moment sampling approach uses a text-to-video moment retrieval model to select relevant frames based on the question.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video large language models (Video LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of video question answering (VideoQA). While existing methods perform well on short videos, they often struggle with long-range reasoning in longer videos. To scale Video LLMs for longer video content, frame sub-sampling (selecting frames at regular intervals) is commonly used. However, this approach is suboptimal, often leading to the loss of crucial frames or the inclusion of redundant information from multiple similar frames. Missing key frames impairs the model's ability to answer questions accurately, while redundant frames lead the model to focus on irrelevant video segments and increase computational resource consumption. In this paper, we investigate the use of a general-purpose text-to-video moment retrieval model to guide the frame sampling process. We propose "moment sampling", a novel, model-agnostic approach that enables the model to select the most relevant frames according to the context of the question. Specifically, we employ a lightweight moment retrieval model to prioritize frame selection. By focusing on the frames most pertinent to the given question, our method enhances long-form VideoQA performance in Video LLMs. Through extensive experiments on four long-form VideoQA datasets, using four state-of-the-art Video LLMs, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Summary:<br />
Model fusion involves combining multiple trained neural networks into a single representative model. This process is complicated by differences in internal representations due to various factors like permutation invariance and random initialization. A novel family of neuron-centric algorithms has been developed to effectively integrate parent models by grouping intermediate neurons and approximating target representations with corresponding sub-networks. These algorithms incorporate neuron attribution scores and can generalize to different layer types. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed algorithms outperform previous fusion techniques, especially in zero-shot and non-IID fusion scenarios.

Abstract: Model fusion aims to combine the knowledge of multiple models by creating one representative model that captures the strengths of all of its parents. However, this process is non-trivial due to differences in internal representations, which can stem from permutation invariance, random initialization, or differently distributed training data. We present a novel, neuron-centric family of model fusion algorithms designed to integrate multiple trained neural networks into a single network effectively regardless of training data distribution. Our algorithms group intermediate neurons of parent models to create target representations that the fused model approximates with its corresponding sub-network. Unlike prior approaches, our approach incorporates neuron attribution scores into the fusion process. Furthermore, our algorithms can generalize to arbitrary layer types. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our algorithms consistently outperform previous fusion techniques, particularly in zero-shot and non-IID fusion scenarios.

Summary: <br />
Data reduction is crucial for enhancing data-centric AI by selecting the most informative instances from large datasets to improve model training efficiency. This paper introduces a data reduction strategy based on Pointwise V-information (PVI) to identify optimal instances for improved model performance. By filtering out low-difficulty instances using PVI, the approach achieves a significant reduction in data size (10%-30%) with minimal loss in classifier accuracy. Additionally, a progressive learning technique utilizing instances sorted by PVI leads to accelerated convergence and a 0.8% increase in accuracy compared to traditional training methods. The study also extends the PVI framework to Chinese NLP tasks, demonstrating its applicability in cross-lingual data reduction and faster training. The released codes provide a valuable resource for implementation and further research in this area. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Data reduction plays a vital role in data-centric AI by identifying the most informative instance within large-scale datasets to enhance model training efficiency. The core challenge lies in how to select the optimal instances-rather than the entire datasets-to improve data quality and training efficiency. In this paper, we propose an effective data reduction strategy based on Pointwise V-information(PVI). First, we quantify instance difficulty using PVI and filter out low-difficulty instances enabling a static approach. Experiments demonstrate that removing 10%-30% of the data preserves the classifier performance with only a 0.0001% to 0.76% loss in accuracy.Second, we use a progressive learning approach to training the classifiers on instances sorted by ascending PVI, accelerating convergence and achieving a 0.8% accuracy gain over conventional training. Our results suggest that with the effective data reduction strategy, training a classifier on the selected optimal subset could enhance the model performance and boost training efficiency. Moreover, we have transferred the PVI framework, which previously applied only to English datasets, to diverse Chinese NLP tasks and base models, leading to valuable insights for cross-lingual data reduction and faster training.

<div> Keywords: Graph classification, Quality measures, Pattern ranking, Benchmark, Clustering

Summary: 
This article presents a comparative analysis of 38 quality measures used in graph classification tasks. The measures are characterized based on four mathematical properties and evaluated empirically using publicly available datasets. A gold standard ranking of patterns is established to compare the performance of the measures. The study introduces a clustering-based preprocessing step to group similar patterns for improved classification results. Results indicate that some commonly used measures in the literature may not be optimal for classification tasks. The proposed preprocessing step reduces the number of patterns to process while maintaining comparable performance. The research highlights the importance of selecting appropriate quality measures for graph classification and suggests that popular measures may not always yield the best results. <div>

Abstract: Graph classification aims to categorize graphs based on their structural and attribute features, with applications in diverse fields such as social network analysis and bioinformatics. Among the methods proposed to solve this task, those relying on patterns (i.e. subgraphs) provide good explainability, as the patterns used for classification can be directly interpreted. To identify meaningful patterns, a standard approach is to use a quality measure, i.e. a function that evaluates the discriminative power of each pattern. However, the literature provides tens of such measures, making it difficult to select the most appropriate for a given application. Only a handful of surveys try to provide some insight by comparing these measures, and none of them specifically focuses on graphs. This typically results in the systematic use of the most widespread measures, without thorough evaluation. To address this issue, we present a comparative analysis of 38 quality measures from the literature. We characterize them theoretically, based on four mathematical properties. We leverage publicly available datasets to constitute a benchmark, and propose a method to elaborate a gold standard ranking of the patterns. We exploit these resources to perform an empirical comparison of the measures, both in terms of pattern ranking and classification performance. Moreover, we propose a clustering-based preprocessing step, which groups patterns appearing in the same graphs to enhance classification performance. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this step, reducing the number of patterns to be processed while achieving comparable performance. Additionally, we show that some popular measures widely used in the literature are not associated with the best results.

Summary:<br />
- In dynamic traffic environments, continual adaptation of edge models for object detection may suffer from catastrophic forgetting.<br />
- Existing approaches like experience replay and visual prompts struggle to effectively prioritize and leverage historical data for optimal knowledge retention and adaptation.<br />
- The proposed ER-EMU algorithm utilizes adaptive experience replay with a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) buffer and a Domain Distance Metric-based Experience Selection (DDM-ES) algorithm.<br />
- DDM-ES uses multi-kernel maximum mean discrepancy to prioritize selection of historical data that is most dissimilar to the current target domain, ensuring training diversity and preventing overfitting.<br />
- Experiments on the Bellevue traffic video dataset show that ER-EMU consistently improves the performance of cloud-edge collaborative object detection frameworks. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.00042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continually adapting edge models in cloud-edge collaborative object detection for traffic monitoring suffers from catastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously learned knowledge when adapting to new data distributions. This is especially problematic in dynamic traffic environments characterised by periodic variations (e.g., day/night, peak hours), where past knowledge remains valuable. Existing approaches like experience replay and visual prompts offer some mitigation, but struggle to effectively prioritize and leverage historical data for optimal knowledge retention and adaptation. Specifically, simply storing and replaying all historical data can be inefficient, while treating all historical experiences as equally important overlooks their varying relevance to the current domain. This paper proposes ER-EMU, an edge model update algorithm based on adaptive experience replay, to address these limitations. ER-EMU utilizes a limited-size experience buffer managed using a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, and a novel Domain Distance Metric-based Experience Selection (DDM-ES) algorithm. DDM-ES employs the multi-kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD) to quantify the dissimilarity between target domains, prioritizing the selection of historical data that is most dissimilar to the current target domain. This ensures training diversity and facilitates the retention of knowledge from a wider range of past experiences, while also preventing overfitting to the new domain. The experience buffer is also updated using a simple random sampling strategy to maintain a balanced representation of previous domains. Experiments on the Bellevue traffic video dataset, involving repeated day/night cycles, demonstrate that ER-EMU consistently improves the performance of several state-of-the-art cloud-edge collaborative object detection frameworks.

Summary:
MR-CLIP is a framework designed to address the challenges of interpreting MRI scans accurately based on image contrast. It aligns MRI images with DICOM metadata to learn contrast-aware representations without the need for manual labels. The framework is trained on a diverse clinical dataset, capturing contrast variations across acquisitions and within scans to enable anatomy-invariant representations. MR-CLIP's effectiveness is demonstrated in cross-modal retrieval and contrast classification tasks, showcasing its scalability and potential for various clinical applications. The code and weights for MR-CLIP are publicly available on GitHub, providing a valuable resource for the research community. The framework offers a solution to the lack of reliable and standardized metadata in MRI datasets, improving image interpretation, retrieval, and integration into clinical workflows. This approach holds promise for advancing clinical applications and achieving modality-invariant representations in the field of medical imaging. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.00043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate interpretation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans in clinical systems is based on a precise understanding of image contrast. This contrast is primarily governed by acquisition parameters, such as echo time and repetition time, which are stored in the DICOM metadata. To simplify contrast identification, broad labels such as T1-weighted or T2-weighted are commonly used, but these offer only a coarse approximation of the underlying acquisition settings. In many real-world datasets, such labels are entirely missing, leaving raw acquisition parameters as the only indicators of contrast. Adding to this challenge, the available metadata is often incomplete, noisy, or inconsistent. The lack of reliable and standardized metadata complicates tasks such as image interpretation, retrieval, and integration into clinical workflows. Furthermore, robust contrast-aware representations are essential to enable more advanced clinical applications, such as achieving modality-invariant representations and data harmonization. To address these challenges, we propose MR-CLIP, a multimodal contrastive learning framework that aligns MR images with their DICOM metadata to learn contrast-aware representations, without relying on manual labels. Trained on a diverse clinical dataset that spans various scanners and protocols, MR-CLIP captures contrast variations across acquisitions and within scans, enabling anatomy-invariant representations. We demonstrate its effectiveness in cross-modal retrieval and contrast classification, highlighting its scalability and potential for further clinical applications. The code and weights are publicly available at https://github.com/myigitavci/MR-CLIP.

Summary:
In the field of cancer diagnostics, Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) is a key technology for digitizing tissue specimens. However, artifacts introduced during slide preparation and scanning can compromise the accuracy of analysis. To tackle this issue, three robust artifact detection approaches were compared: a foundation model-based approach (FMA), a deep learning approach (DLA), and a knowledge-based approach (KBA). Evaluations on 50,000+ image patches from various scanners showed that the FMA outperformed the other methods with a high patch-wise AUROC of 0.995. To provide actionable insights, a quality report scorecard was developed to quantify high-quality image patches and visualize artifact distributions. This research showcases the effectiveness of utilizing advanced technologies like deep learning in improving the quality and accuracy of digital histopathology. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In modern cancer diagnostics, Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) is widely used to digitize tissue specimens for detailed, high-resolution examination; however, other diagnostic approaches, such as liquid biopsy and molecular testing, are also utilized based on the cancer type and clinical context. While WSI has revolutionized digital histopathology by enabling automated, precise analysis, it remains vulnerable to artifacts introduced during slide preparation and scanning. These artifacts can compromise downstream image analysis. To address this challenge, we propose and compare three robust artifact detection approaches for WSIs: (1) a foundation model-based approach (FMA) using a fine-tuned Unified Neural Image (UNI) architecture, (2) a deep learning approach (DLA) built on a ResNet50 backbone, and (3) a knowledge-based approach (KBA) leveraging handcrafted features from texture, color, and frequency-based metrics. The methods target six common artifact types: tissue folds, out-of-focus regions, air bubbles, tissue damage, marker traces, and blood contamination. Evaluations were conducted on 50,000+ image patches from diverse scanners (Hamamatsu, Philips, Leica Aperio AT2) across multiple sites. The FMA achieved the highest patch-wise AUROC of 0.995 (95% CI [0.994, 0.995]), outperforming the ResNet50-based method (AUROC: 0.977, 95% CI [0.977, 0.978]) and the KBA (AUROC: 0.940, 95% CI [0.933, 0.946]). To translate detection into actionable insights, we developed a quality report scorecard that quantifies high-quality patches and visualizes artifact distributions.

Summary:
The article explores the performance of agentic Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-03 in challenging detective tasks. While MLLMs excel in expert-level tasks, they struggle in scenarios like CaughtCheating where subtle clues must be detected from images. The study identifies the limitations of existing MLLMs in handling such tasks, emphasizing the need for enhanced visual perception and reasoning capabilities. By investigating the CaughtCheating scenario, the research aims to bridge the gap between MLLMs and human detective abilities, offering valuable insights for practical usage. Success in these challenging tasks could enable MLLMs to achieve human-level detective skills, providing a new avenue for advancing artificial intelligence in perception and reasoning. <div>

Abstract: Recent agentic Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) such as GPT-o3 have achieved near-ceiling scores on various existing benchmarks, motivating a demand for more challenging test tasks. These MLLMs have been reported to excel in a few expert-level tasks for humans, e.g., GeoGuesser, reflecting their potential as a detective who can notice minuscule cues in an image and weave them into coherent, situational explanations, leading to a reliable answer. But can they match the performance of excellent human detectives? To answer this question, we investigate some hard scenarios where GPT-o3 can still handle, and find a common scenario where o3's performance drops to nearly zero, which we name CaughtCheating. It is inspired by the social media requests that ask others to detect suspicious clues from photos shared by the poster's partner. We conduct extensive experiments and analysis to understand why existing MLLMs lack sufficient capability to solve this kind of task. CaughtCheating provides a class of challenging visual perception and reasoning tasks with great value and practical usage. Success in these tasks paves the way for MLLMs to acquire human-level detective perception and reasoning capabilities.

The article introduces VSF--Med, a framework for evaluating the security of Vision Language Models (VLMs) in medical imaging. It includes text-prompt attack templates, imperceptible visual perturbations, and a rubric for vulnerability scoring. VSF--Med allows for the benchmarking of medical VLMs using over 30,000 adversarial variants from radiology images.

The framework aims to streamline labor-intensive medical imaging workflows and enhance the security evaluation of VLMs in clinical settings.<br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) hold great promise for streamlining labour-intensive medical imaging workflows, yet systematic security evaluations in clinical settings remain scarce. We introduce VSF--Med, an end-to-end vulnerability-scoring framework for medical VLMs that unites three novel components: (i) a rich library of sophisticated text-prompt attack templates targeting emerging threat vectors; (ii) imperceptible visual perturbations calibrated by structural similarity (SSIM) thresholds to preserve clinical realism; and (iii) an eight-dimensional rubric evaluated by two independent judge LLMs, whose raw scores are consolidated via z-score normalization to yield a 0--32 composite risk metric. Built entirely on publicly available datasets and accompanied by open-source code, VSF--Med synthesizes over 30,000 adversarial variants from 5,000 radiology images and enables reproducible benchmarking of any medical VLM with a single command. Our consolidated analysis reports mean z-score shifts of $0.90\sigma$ for persistence-of-attack-effects, $0.74\sigma$ for prompt-injection effectiveness, and $0.63\sigma$ for safety-bypass success across state-of-the-art VLMs. Notably, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct exhibits a peak vulnerability increase of $1.29\sigma$ for persistence-of-attack-effects, while GPT-4o shows increases of $0.69\sigma$ for that same vector and $0.28\sigma$ for prompt-injection attacks.

<div> Keywords: code generation, natural language specifications, Large Language Models, incoherence, error estimation<br />
Summary:<br />
Generating code from natural language specifications using Large Language Models (LLMs) has been successful, but LLMs often produce factually incorrect outputs. This paper introduces a measure of incorrectness called incoherence, which estimates the probability of generated code being incorrect without an existing correct implementation. The proposed methodology efficiently identifies incorrect programs and can replace oracle-based evaluation of LLMs with high reliability. Experiments show that the incoherence-based evaluation can identify about two-thirds of incorrect programs without false positives. The ranking of LLMs based on correctness assessment by an oracle is strongly correlated with the ranking based on incoherence evaluation. This approach provides a valuable tool for assessing the accuracy of code generated by LLMs in the absence of an oracle.<br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.00057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating code from natural language specifications is one of the most successful applications of Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet, they hallucinate: LLMs produce outputs that may be grammatically correct but are factually incorrect. Without an existing, correct implementation (i.e., an oracle), can we quantify how likely the generated program is correct?
  In this paper, we propose a measure of incorrectness, called incoherence, that can be estimated efficiently in the absence of an oracle and provides a lower bound on the error, i.e., the probability that the LLM-generated program for that specification is incorrect. Our experiments demonstrate an extraordinary effectiveness. For the average code generation task, our incoherence-based methodology can automatically identify about two-thirds of incorrect programs without reports of false positives. In fact, an oracle-based evaluation of LLMs can be reliably replaced by an incoherence-based evaluation. In particular, we find a very strong agreement between the ranking of LLMs by the number of programs deemed correct via an oracle (pass@1) and the ranking of LLMs by the number of programs deemed correct via our incoherence.

Abstract: This paper introduces Smooth-Distill, a novel self-distillation framework designed to simultaneously perform human activity recognition (HAR) and sensor placement detection using wearable sensor data. The proposed approach utilizes a unified CNN-based architecture, MTL-net, which processes accelerometer data and branches into two outputs for each respective task. Unlike conventional distillation methods that require separate teacher and student models, the proposed framework utilizes a smoothed, historical version of the model itself as the teacher, significantly reducing training computational overhead while maintaining performance benefits. To support this research, we developed a comprehensive accelerometer-based dataset capturing 12 distinct sleep postures across three different wearing positions, complementing two existing public datasets (MHealth and WISDM). Experimental results show that Smooth-Distill consistently outperforms alternative approaches across different evaluation scenarios, achieving notable improvements in both human activity recognition and device placement detection tasks. This method demonstrates enhanced stability in convergence patterns during training and exhibits reduced overfitting compared to traditional multitask learning baselines. This framework contributes to the practical implementation of knowledge distillation in human activity recognition systems, offering an effective solution for multitask learning with accelerometer data that balances accuracy and training efficiency. More broadly, it reduces the computational cost of model training, which is critical for scenarios requiring frequent model updates or training on resource-constrained platforms.

Abstract: Human reliability remains a critical concern in safety-critical domains such as nuclear power, where operational failures are often linked to human error. While conventional human reliability analysis (HRA) methods have been widely adopted, they rely heavily on expert judgment for identifying human failure events (HFEs) and assigning performance influencing factors (PIFs). This reliance introduces challenges related to reproducibility, subjectivity, and limited integration of interface-level data. In particular, current approaches lack the capacity to rigorously assess how human-machine interface design contributes to operator performance variability and error susceptibility. To address these limitations, this study proposes a framework for risk-informed human failure event identification and interface-induced risk assessment driven by AutoGraph (InSight-R). By linking empirical behavioral data to the interface-embedded knowledge graph (IE-KG) constructed by the automated graph-based execution framework (AutoGraph), the InSight-R framework enables automated HFE identification based on both error-prone and time-deviated operational paths. Furthermore, we discuss the relationship between designer-user conflicts and human error. The results demonstrate that InSight-R not only enhances the objectivity and interpretability of HFE identification but also provides a scalable pathway toward dynamic, real-time human reliability assessment in digitalized control environments. This framework offers actionable insights for interface design optimization and contributes to the advancement of mechanism-driven HRA methodologies.

Abstract: While multi-modal learning has advanced significantly, current approaches often treat modalities separately, creating inconsistencies in representation and reasoning. We introduce MANTA (Multi-modal Abstraction and Normalization via Textual Alignment), a theoretically-grounded framework that unifies visual and auditory inputs into a structured textual space for seamless processing with large language models. MANTA addresses four key challenges: (1) semantic alignment across modalities with information-theoretic optimization, (2) adaptive temporal synchronization for varying information densities, (3) hierarchical content representation for multi-scale understanding, and (4) context-aware retrieval of sparse information from long sequences. We formalize our approach within a rigorous mathematical framework, proving its optimality for context selection under token constraints. Extensive experiments on the challenging task of Long Video Question Answering show that MANTA improves state-of-the-art models by up to 22.6% in overall accuracy, with particularly significant gains (27.3%) on videos exceeding 30 minutes. Additionally, we demonstrate MANTA's superiority on temporal reasoning tasks (23.8% improvement) and cross-modal understanding (25.1% improvement). Our framework introduces novel density estimation techniques for redundancy minimization while preserving rare signals, establishing new foundations for unifying multimodal representations through structured text.

Abstract: Plant diseases pose significant challenges to farmers and the agricultural sector at large. However, early detection of plant diseases is crucial to mitigating their effects and preventing widespread damage, as outbreaks can severely impact the productivity and quality of crops. With advancements in technology, there are increasing opportunities for automating the monitoring and detection of disease outbreaks in plants. This study proposed a system designed to identify and monitor plant diseases using a transfer learning approach. Specifically, the study utilizes YOLOv7 and YOLOv8, two state-ofthe-art models in the field of object detection. By fine-tuning these models on a dataset of plant leaf images, the system is able to accurately detect the presence of Bacteria, Fungi and Viral diseases such as Powdery Mildew, Angular Leaf Spot, Early blight and Tomato mosaic virus. The model's performance was evaluated using several metrics, including mean Average Precision (mAP), F1-score, Precision, and Recall, yielding values of 91.05, 89.40, 91.22, and 87.66, respectively. The result demonstrates the superior effectiveness and efficiency of YOLOv8 compared to other object detection methods, highlighting its potential for use in modern agricultural practices. The approach provides a scalable, automated solution for early any plant disease detection, contributing to enhanced crop yield, reduced reliance on manual monitoring, and supporting sustainable agricultural practices.

<title>Theoretical Modeling of LLM Self-Improvement Training Dynamics Through Solver-Verifier Gap</title>

Abstract: Self-improvement is among the most prominent techniques within the realm of large language models (LLM), aiming to enhance the LLM performance without relying on external data. Despite its significance, generally how LLM performances evolve during the self-improvement process remains underexplored. In this paper, we theoretically model the training dynamics of self-improvement via the concept of solver-verifier gap. This is inspired by the conjecture that the performance enhancement of self-improvement stems from the gap between LLM's solver capability and verifier capability. Based on the theoretical framework, we further introduce how to predict the ultimate power of self-improvement using only information from the first few training epochs. We empirically validate the effectiveness of the theoretical model on various LLMs and datasets. Beyond self-improvement, we extend our analysis to investigate how external data influences these dynamics within the framework. Notably, we find that under limited external data regimes, such external data can be utilized at any stage without significantly affecting final performances, which accords with the empirical observations.

<title>The language of time: a language model perspective on time-series foundation models</title>

Abstract: With the rise of large language models, the paradigm of training foundation models with massive parameter counts on vast datasets has been adopted in multiple domains to achieve remarkable success. Time series foundation models represent a significant extension of this paradigm, demonstrating exceptional expressive power, generalization, and cross-domain transferability. However, this gives rise to a fundamental paradox: time series data reflect distinct dynamical systems, making cross-domain transfer intuitively implausible, yet this is contradicted by the models' empirical success. To resolve this paradox, this paper investigates, from both theoretical and experimental perspectives, the representation learning mechanisms and generalization capabilities of patch-based time series foundation models. We argue that such models are not merely applying a new architecture but are fundamentally generalizing the representation paradigm of language models by extending deterministic vector-based representations to latent probabilistic distributional forms. Our theoretical analysis supports this framework by demonstrating that continuous time-series patches can be faithfully quantized into a discrete vocabulary whose key statistical properties are highly consistent with those of natural language. This generalization allows time series models to inherit the robust representation and transfer abilities of large language models, thereby explaining their superior performance in temporal tasks. Ultimately, our work provides a rigorous theoretical cornerstone for understanding, evaluating, and improving the safety and reliability of large-scale time series foundation models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled powerful advances in natural language understanding and generation. Yet their application to complex, real-world scientific workflows remain limited by challenges in memory, planning, and tool integration. Here, we introduce SciBORG (Scientific Bespoke Artificial Intelligence Agents Optimized for Research Goals), a modular agentic framework that allows LLM-based agents to autonomously plan, reason, and achieve robust and reliable domain-specific task execution. Agents are constructed dynamically from source code documentation and augmented with finite-state automata (FSA) memory, enabling persistent state tracking and context-aware decision-making. This approach eliminates the need for manual prompt engineering and allows for robust, scalable deployment across diverse applications via maintaining context across extended workflows and to recover from tool or execution failures. We validate SciBORG through integration with both physical and virtual hardware, such as microwave synthesizers for executing user-specified reactions, with context-aware decision making and demonstrate its use in autonomous multi-step bioassay retrieval from the PubChem database utilizing multi-step planning, reasoning, agent-to-agent communication and coordination for execution of exploratory tasks. Systematic benchmarking shows that SciBORG agents achieve reliable execution, adaptive planning, and interpretable state transitions. Our results show that memory and state awareness are critical enablers of agentic planning and reliability, offering a generalizable foundation for deploying AI agents in complex environments.

<title>Federated Learning-Enabled Hybrid Language Models for Communication-Efficient Token Transmission</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00082</link>

Abstract: Hybrid Language Models (HLMs) combine the low-latency efficiency of Small Language Models (SLMs) on edge devices with the high accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) on centralized servers. Unlike traditional end-to-end LLM inference, HLMs reduce latency and communication by invoking LLMs only when local SLM predictions are uncertain, i.e., when token-level confidence is low or entropy is high. However, ambiguous or low-confidence predictions still require frequent offloading to the LLM, leading to significant communication overhead in bandwidth-constrained settings. To address this, we propose FedHLM, a communication-efficient HLM framework that integrates uncertainty-aware inference with Federated Learning (FL). FedHLM's key innovation lies in collaboratively learning token-level uncertainty thresholds that govern when LLM assistance is needed. Rather than using static or manually tuned thresholds, FedHLM employs FL to optimize these thresholds in a privacy-preserving, distributed manner. Additionally, it leverages embedding-based token representations for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) resolution, enabling clients to reuse tokens inferred by semantically similar peers without engaging the LLM. We further introduce hierarchical model aggregation: edge servers refine local routing policies through client updates, while cross-cluster coordination aligns global decision boundaries. This layered design captures recurring uncertainty patterns, reducing redundant LLM queries. Experiments on large-scale news classification tasks show that FedHLM reduces LLM transmissions by over 95 percent with negligible accuracy loss, making it well-suited for scalable and efficient edge-AI applications.

Abstract: This study addresses the lack of structured causal modeling between tactical strike behavior and strategic delay in current strategic-level simulations, particularly the structural bottlenecks in capturing intermediate variables within the "resilience - nodal suppression - negotiation window" chain. We propose the Intervention-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (IA-STGNN), a novel framework that closes the causal loop from tactical input to strategic delay output. The model integrates graph attention mechanisms, counterfactual simulation units, and spatial intervention node reconstruction to enable dynamic simulations of strike configurations and synchronization strategies. Training data are generated from a multi-physics simulation platform (GEANT4 + COMSOL) under NIST SP 800-160 standards, ensuring structural traceability and policy-level validation. Experimental results demonstrate that IA-STGNN significantly outperforms baseline models (ST-GNN, GCN-LSTM, XGBoost), achieving a 12.8 percent reduction in MAE and 18.4 percent increase in Top-5 percent accuracy, while improving causal path consistency and intervention stability. IA-STGNN enables interpretable prediction of strategic delay and supports applications such as nuclear deterrence simulation, diplomatic window assessment, and multi-strategy optimization, providing a structured and transparent AI decision-support mechanism for high-level policy modeling.

<title>A Joint Topology-Data Fusion Graph Network for Robust Traffic Speed Prediction with Data Anomalism</title>

Abstract: Accurate traffic prediction is essential for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), yet current methods struggle with the inherent complexity and non-linearity of traffic dynamics, making it difficult to integrate spatial and temporal characteristics. Furthermore, existing approaches use static techniques to address non-stationary and anomalous historical data, which limits adaptability and undermines data smoothing. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Graph Fusion Enhanced Network (GFEN), an innovative framework for network-level traffic speed prediction. GFEN introduces a novel topological spatiotemporal graph fusion technique that meticulously extracts and merges spatial and temporal correlations from both data distribution and network topology using trainable methods, enabling the modeling of multi-scale spatiotemporal features. Additionally, GFEN employs a hybrid methodology combining a k-th order difference-based mathematical framework with an attention-based deep learning structure to adaptively smooth historical observations and dynamically mitigate data anomalies and non-stationarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GFEN surpasses state-of-the-art methods by approximately 6.3% in prediction accuracy and exhibits convergence rates nearly twice as fast as recent hybrid models, confirming its superior performance and potential to significantly enhance traffic prediction system efficiency.

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced mass spectrometry data interpretation, yet most models remain feature extractors rather than unified scoring frameworks. We present pUniFind, the first large-scale multimodal pre-trained model in proteomics that integrates end-to-end peptide-spectrum scoring with open, zero-shot de novo sequencing. Trained on over 100 million open search-derived spectra, pUniFind aligns spectral and peptide modalities via cross modality prediction and outperforms traditional engines across diverse datasets, particularly achieving a 42.6 percent increase in the number of identified peptides in immunopeptidomics. Supporting over 1,300 modifications, pUniFind identifies 60 percent more PSMs than existing de novo methods despite a 300-fold larger search space. A deep learning based quality control module further recovers 38.5 percent additional peptides including 1,891 mapped to the genome but absent from reference proteomes while preserving full fragment ion coverage. These results establish a unified, scalable deep learning framework for proteomic analysis, offering improved sensitivity, modification coverage, and interpretability.

Abstract: Humans increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) to support decisions in social settings. Previous work suggests that such tools shape people's moral and political judgements. However, the long-term implications of LLM-based social decision-making remain unknown. How will human cooperation be affected when the assessment of social interactions relies on language models? This is a pressing question, as human cooperation is often driven by indirect reciprocity, reputations, and the capacity to judge interactions of others. Here, we assess how state-of-the-art LLMs judge cooperative actions. We provide 21 different LLMs with an extensive set of examples where individuals cooperate -- or refuse cooperating -- in a range of social contexts, and ask how these interactions should be judged. Furthermore, through an evolutionary game-theoretical model, we evaluate cooperation dynamics in populations where the extracted LLM-driven judgements prevail, assessing the long-term impact of LLMs on human prosociality. We observe a remarkable agreement in evaluating cooperation against good opponents. On the other hand, we notice within- and between-model variance when judging cooperation with ill-reputed individuals. We show that the differences revealed between models can significantly impact the prevalence of cooperation. Finally, we test prompts to steer LLM norms, showing that such interventions can shape LLM judgements, particularly through goal-oriented prompts. Our research connects LLM-based advices and long-term social dynamics, and highlights the need to carefully align LLM norms in order to preserve human cooperation.

Abstract: Allocation of personnel and material resources is highly sensible in the case of firefighter interventions. This allocation relies on simulations to experiment with various scenarios. The main objective of this allocation is the global optimization of the firefighters response. Data generation is then mandatory to study various scenarios In this study, we propose to compare different data generation methods. Methods such as Random Sampling, Tabular Variational Autoencoders, standard Generative Adversarial Networks, Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Probabilistic Models are examined to ascertain their efficacy in capturing the intricacies of firefighter interventions. Traditional evaluation metrics often fall short in capturing the nuanced requirements of synthetic datasets for real-world scenarios. To address this gap, an evaluation of synthetic data quality is conducted using a combination of domain-specific metrics tailored to the firefighting domain and standard measures such as the Wasserstein distance. Domain-specific metrics include response time distribution, spatial-temporal distribution of interventions, and accidents representation. These metrics are designed to assess data variability, the preservation of fine and complex correlations and anomalies such as event with a very low occurrence, the conformity with the initial statistical distribution and the operational relevance of the synthetic data. The distribution has the particularity of being highly unbalanced, none of the variables following a Gaussian distribution, adding complexity to the data generation process.

Abstract: Maximal Ancestral Graphs (MAGs) provide an abstract representation of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) with latent (selection) variables. These graphical objects encode information about ancestral relations and d-separations of the DAGs they represent. This abstract representation has been used amongst others to prove the soundness and completeness of the FCI algorithm for causal discovery, and to derive a do-calculus for its output. One significant inherent limitation of MAGs is that they rule out the possibility of cyclic causal relationships. In this work, we address that limitation. We introduce and study a class of graphical objects that we coin ''$\sigma$-Maximal Ancestral Graphs'' (''$\sigma$-MAGs''). We show how these graphs provide an abstract representation of (possibly cyclic) Directed Graphs (DGs) with latent (selection) variables, analogously to how MAGs represent DAGs. We study the properties of these objects and provide a characterization of their Markov equivalence classes.

Abstract: Despite growing interest in process analysis and mining for data-aware specifications, alignment-based conformance checking for declarative process models has focused on pure control-flow specifications, or mild data-aware extensions limited to numerical data and variable-to-constant comparisons. This is not surprising: finding alignments is computationally hard, even more so in the presence of data dependencies. In this paper, we challenge this problem in the case where the reference model is captured using data-aware Declare with general data types and data conditions. We show that, unexpectedly, it is possible to compute data-aware optimal alignments in this rich setting, enjoying at once efficiency and expressiveness. This is achieved by carefully combining the two best-known approaches to deal with control flow and data dependencies when computing alignments, namely A* search and SMT solving. Specifically, we introduce a novel algorithmic technique that efficiently explores the search space, generating descendant states through the application of repair actions aiming at incrementally resolving constraint violations. We prove the correctness of our algorithm and experimentally show its efficiency. The evaluation witnesses that our approach matches or surpasses the performance of the state of the art while also supporting significantly more expressive data dependencies, showcasing its potential to support real-world applications.

Abstract: Alternative Assets tokenization is transforming non-traditional financial instruments are represented and traded on the web. However, ensuring trustworthiness in web-based tokenized ecosystems poses significant challenges, from verifying off-chain asset data to enforcing regulatory compliance. This paper proposes an AI-governed agent architecture that integrates intelligent agents with blockchain to achieve web-trustworthy tokenization of alternative assets. In the proposed architecture, autonomous agents orchestrate the tokenization process (asset verification, valuation, compliance checking, and lifecycle management), while an AI-driven governance layer monitors agent behavior and enforces trust through adaptive policies and cryptoeconomic incentives. We demonstrate that this approach enhances transparency, security, and compliance in asset tokenization, addressing key concerns around data authenticity and fraud. A case study on tokenizing real estate assets illustrates how the architecture mitigates risks (e.g., fraudulent listings and money laundering) through real-time AI anomaly detection and on-chain enforcement. Our evaluation and analysis suggest that combining AI governance with multi-agent systems and blockchain can significantly bolster trust in tokenized asset ecosystems. This work offers a novel framework for trustworthy asset tokenization on the web and provides insights for practitioners aiming to deploy secure, compliant tokenization platforms.

<title>Towards transparent and data-driven fault detection in manufacturing: A case study on univariate, discrete time series</title>

Abstract: Ensuring consistent product quality in modern manufacturing is crucial, particularly in safety-critical applications. Conventional quality control approaches, reliant on manually defined thresholds and features, lack adaptability to the complexity and variability inherent in production data and necessitate extensive domain expertise. Conversely, data-driven methods, such as machine learning, demonstrate high detection performance but typically function as black-box models, thereby limiting their acceptance in industrial environments where interpretability is paramount. This paper introduces a methodology for industrial fault detection, which is both data-driven and transparent. The approach integrates a supervised machine learning model for multi-class fault classification, Shapley Additive Explanations for post-hoc interpretability, and a do-main-specific visualisation technique that maps model explanations to operator-interpretable features. Furthermore, the study proposes an evaluation methodology that assesses model explanations through quantitative perturbation analysis and evaluates visualisations by qualitative expert assessment. The approach was applied to the crimping process, a safety-critical joining technique, using a dataset of univariate, discrete time series. The system achieves a fault detection accuracy of 95.9 %, and both quantitative selectivity analysis and qualitative expert evaluations confirmed the relevance and inter-pretability of the generated explanations. This human-centric approach is designed to enhance trust and interpretability in data-driven fault detection, thereby contributing to applied system design in industrial quality control.

Abstract: Computer programming is undergoing a true transformation driven by powerful new tools for automatic source code generation based on large language models. This transformation is also manifesting in introductory programming courses at universities around the world, generating an in-depth debate about how programming content should be taught, learned, and assessed in the context of generative artificial intelligence.
  This article aims, on the one hand, to review the most relevant studies on this issue, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages identified in the specialized literature. On the other hand, it proposes enriching teaching and learning methodologies by focusing on code comprehension and execution rather than on mere coding or program functionality. In particular, it advocates for the use of visual representations of code and visual simulations of its execution as effective tools for teaching, learning, and assessing programming, thus fostering a deeper understanding among students.
  Finally, the opinions of students who took the object-oriented programming course are presented to provide preliminary context supporting the incorporation of visual simulations in Java (or other languages) as part of the training process.

Abstract: AI-Hybrid TRNG is a deep-learning framework that extracts near-uniform entropy directly from physical noise, eliminating the need for bulky quantum devices or expensive laboratory-grade RF receivers. Instead, it relies on a low-cost, thumb-sized RF front end, plus CPU-timing jitter, for training, and then emits 32-bit high-entropy streams without any quantization step.
  Unlike deterministic or trained artificial intelligence random number generators (RNGs), our dynamic inner-outer network couples adaptive natural sources and reseeding, yielding truly unpredictable and autonomous sequences. Generated numbers pass the NIST SP 800-22 battery better than a CPU-based method. It also passes nineteen bespoke statistical tests for both bit- and integer-level analysis. All results satisfy cryptographic standards, while forward and backward prediction experiments reveal no exploitable biases. The model's footprint is below 0.5 MB, making it deployable on MCUs and FPGA soft cores, as well as suitable for other resource-constrained platforms.
  By detaching randomness quality from dedicated hardware, AI-Hybrid TRNG broadens the reach of high-integrity random number generators across secure systems, cryptographic protocols, embedded and edge devices, stochastic simulations, and server applications that need randomness.

Abstract: Political polarization undermines democratic civic education by exacerbating identity-based resistance to opposing viewpoints. Emerging AI technologies offer new opportunities to advance interventions that reduce polarization and promote political open-mindedness. We examined novel design strategies that leverage adaptive and emotionally-responsive civic narratives that may sustain students' emotional engagement in stories, and in turn, promote perspective-taking toward members of political out-groups. Drawing on theories from political psychology and narratology, we investigate how affective computing techniques can support three storytelling mechanisms: transportation into a story world, identification with characters, and interaction with the storyteller. Using a design-based research (DBR) approach, we iteratively developed and refined an AI-mediated Digital Civic Storytelling (AI-DCS) platform. Our prototype integrates facial emotion recognition and attention tracking to assess users' affective and attentional states in real time. Narrative content is organized around pre-structured story outlines, with beat-by-beat language adaptation implemented via GPT-4, personalizing linguistic tone to sustain students' emotional engagement in stories that center political perspectives different from their own. Our work offers a foundation for AI-supported, emotionally-sensitive strategies that address affective polarization while preserving learner autonomy. We conclude with implications for civic education interventions, algorithmic literacy, and HCI challenges associated with AI dialogue management and affect-adaptive learning environments.

Abstract: Recent research shows how diffusion models can unconditionally generate tile-based game levels, but use of diffusion models for text-to-level generation is underexplored. There are practical considerations for creating a usable model: caption/level pairs are needed, as is a text embedding model, and a way of generating entire playable levels, rather than individual scenes. We present strategies to automatically assign descriptive captions to an existing level dataset, and train diffusion models using both pretrained text encoders and simple transformer models trained from scratch. Captions are automatically assigned to generated levels so that the degree of overlap between input and output captions can be compared. We also assess the diversity and playability of the resulting levels. Results are compared with an unconditional diffusion model and a generative adversarial network, as well as the text-to-level approaches Five-Dollar Model and MarioGPT. Notably, the best diffusion model uses a simple transformer model for text embedding, and takes less time to train than diffusion models employing more complex text encoders, indicating that reliance on larger language models is not necessary. We also present a GUI allowing designers to construct long levels from model-generated scenes.

Abstract: Current artificial intelligence models for medical imaging are predominantly single modality and single disease. Attempts to create multimodal and multi-disease models have resulted in inconsistent clinical accuracy. Furthermore, training these models typically requires large, labour-intensive, well-labelled datasets. We developed MerMED-FM, a state-of-the-art multimodal, multi-specialty foundation model trained using self-supervised learning and a memory module. MerMED-FM was trained on 3.3 million medical images from over ten specialties and seven modalities, including computed tomography (CT), chest X-rays (CXR), ultrasound (US), pathology patches, color fundus photography (CFP), optical coherence tomography (OCT) and dermatology images. MerMED-FM was evaluated across multiple diseases and compared against existing foundational models. Strong performance was achieved across all modalities, with AUROCs of 0.988 (OCT); 0.982 (pathology); 0.951 (US); 0.943 (CT); 0.931 (skin); 0.894 (CFP); 0.858 (CXR). MerMED-FM has the potential to be a highly adaptable, versatile, cross-specialty foundation model that enables robust medical imaging interpretation across diverse medical disciplines.

Abstract: Wearable devices record physiological and behavioral signals that can improve health predictions. While foundation models are increasingly used for such predictions, they have been primarily applied to low-level sensor data, despite behavioral data often being more informative due to their alignment with physiologically relevant timescales and quantities. We develop foundation models of such behavioral signals using over 2.5B hours of wearable data from 162K individuals, systematically optimizing architectures and tokenization strategies for this unique dataset. Evaluated on 57 health-related tasks, our model shows strong performance across diverse real-world applications including individual-level classification and time-varying health state prediction. The model excels in behavior-driven tasks like sleep prediction, and improves further when combined with representations of raw sensor data. These results underscore the importance of tailoring foundation model design to wearables and demonstrate the potential to enable new health applications.

Abstract: This thesis contributes to the theoretical understanding of local update algorithms, especially Local SGD, in distributed and federated optimization under realistic models of data heterogeneity. A central focus is on the bounded second-order heterogeneity assumption, which is shown to be both necessary and sufficient for local updates to outperform centralized or mini-batch methods in convex and non-convex settings. The thesis establishes tight upper and lower bounds in several regimes for various local update algorithms and characterizes the min-max complexity of multiple problem classes. At its core is a fine-grained consensus-error-based analysis framework that yields sharper finite-time convergence bounds under third-order smoothness and relaxed heterogeneity assumptions. The thesis also extends to online federated learning, providing fundamental regret bounds under both first-order and bandit feedback. Together, these results clarify when and why local updates offer provable advantages, and the thesis serves as a self-contained guide for analyzing Local SGD in heterogeneous environments.

Abstract: High-resolution imaging is crucial for enhancing visual clarity and enabling precise computer-assisted guidance in minimally invasive surgery (MIS). Despite the increasing adoption of 4K endoscopic systems, there remains a significant gap in publicly available native 4K datasets tailored specifically for robotic-assisted MIS. We introduce SurgiSR4K, the first publicly accessible surgical imaging and video dataset captured at a native 4K resolution, representing realistic conditions of robotic-assisted procedures. SurgiSR4K comprises diverse visual scenarios including specular reflections, tool occlusions, bleeding, and soft tissue deformations, meticulously designed to reflect common challenges faced during laparoscopic and robotic surgeries. This dataset opens up possibilities for a broad range of computer vision tasks that might benefit from high resolution data, such as super resolution (SR), smoke removal, surgical instrument detection, 3D tissue reconstruction, monocular depth estimation, instance segmentation, novel view synthesis, and vision-language model (VLM) development. SurgiSR4K provides a robust foundation for advancing research in high-resolution surgical imaging and fosters the development of intelligent imaging technologies aimed at enhancing performance, safety, and usability in image-guided robotic surgeries.

Abstract: Standard classification models often map inputs directly to labels without explicit reasoning, potentially limiting their performance, robustness, and interpretability. This paper introduces a novel two-stage approach to enhance text classification by leveraging Large Language Model (LLM)-generated reasonings. In the first stage, we fine-tune a Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct model (henceforth Llama-R-Gen) on a general-purpose reasoning dataset (syvai/reasoning-gen) to generate textual reasoning (R) given a question and its answer. In the second stage, this generally trained Llama-R-Gen is used offline to create an augmented training dataset for a downstream generative model. This downstream model, based on Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, takes only the input text (Q) and is trained to output the generated reasoning (R) immediately followed by the predicted emotion (A). We demonstrate this methodology on the dair-ai/emotion dataset for emotion classification. Our experiments show that the generative model trained to output reasoning and the emotion (Classifier Q->RA) achieves a significant improvement of 8.7 percentage points in accuracy (for emotion prediction) compared to a baseline generative model trained solely to output the emotion (Classifier Q->A), highlighting the strong generalization capabilities of the reasoning generation and the benefit of explicit reasoning training. This work underscores the potential of LLM-generated reasonings for creating richer training datasets, thereby improving the performance of diverse downstream NLP tasks and providing explicit explanations.

We identify the simplest analytic relationships connecting pairs of these constants and report several notable observations based on about a thousand expressions with relative precision better than 1%. These results may serve as valuable inputs for model builders and artificial intelligence methods aimed at uncovering hidden patterns among the SM constants, or potentially used as building blocks for a deeper underlying law that connects all parameters of the SM through a small set of fundamental constants.

<title>Investigating Stochastic Methods for Prosody Modeling in Speech Synthesis</title>

Abstract: While generative methods have progressed rapidly in recent years, generating expressive prosody for an utterance remains a challenging task in text-to-speech synthesis. This is particularly true for systems that model prosody explicitly through parameters such as pitch, energy, and duration, which is commonly done for the sake of interpretability and controllability. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of stochastic methods for this task, including Normalizing Flows, Conditional Flow Matching, and Rectified Flows. We compare these methods to a traditional deterministic baseline, as well as to real human realizations. Our extensive subjective and objective evaluations demonstrate that stochastic methods produce natural prosody on par with human speakers by capturing the variability inherent in human speech. Further, they open up additional controllability options by allowing the sampling temperature to be tuned.

Abstract: Speech super-resolution (SSR) enhances low-resolution speech by increasing the sampling rate. While most SSR methods focus on magnitude reconstruction, recent research highlights the importance of phase reconstruction for improved perceptual quality. Therefore, we introduce CTFT-Net, a Complex Time-Frequency Transformation Network that reconstructs both magnitude and phase in complex domains for improved SSR tasks. It incorporates a complex global attention block to model inter-phoneme and inter-frequency dependencies and a complex conformer to capture long-range and local features, improving frequency reconstruction and noise robustness. CTFT-Net employs time-domain and multi-resolution frequency-domain loss functions for better generalization. Experiments show CTFT-Net outperforms state-of-the-art models (NU-Wave, WSRGlow, NVSR, AERO) on the VCTK dataset, particularly for extreme upsampling (2 kHz to 48 kHz), reconstructing high frequencies effectively without noisy artifacts.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for enhancing model interpretability by integrating heatmaps produced separately by ResNet and a restructured 2D Transformer with globally weighted input saliency. We address the critical problem of spatial-temporal misalignment in existing interpretability methods, where convolutional networks fail to capture global context and Transformers lack localized precision - a limitation that impedes actionable insights in safety-critical domains like healthcare and industrial monitoring. Our method merges gradient-weighted activation maps (ResNet) and Transformer attention rollout into a unified visualization, achieving full spatial-temporal alignment while preserving real-time performance. Empirical evaluations on clinical (ECG arrhythmia detection) and industrial (energy consumption prediction) datasets demonstrate significant improvements: the hybrid framework achieves 94.1% accuracy (F1 0.93) on the PhysioNet dataset and reduces regression error to RMSE = 0.28 kWh (R2 = 0.95) on the UCI Energy Appliance dataset-outperforming standalone ResNet, Transformer, and InceptionTime baselines by 3.8-12.4%. An NLP module translates fused heatmaps into domain-specific narratives (e.g., "Elevated ST-segment between 2-4 seconds suggests myocardial ischemia"), validated via BLEU-4 (0.586) and ROUGE-L (0.650) scores. By formalizing interpretability as causal fidelity and spatial-temporal alignment, our approach bridges the gap between technical outputs and stakeholder understanding, offering a scalable solution for transparent, time-aware decision-making.

Abstract: Most commonly used language models (LMs) are instruction-tuned and aligned using a combination of fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, causing them to refuse users requests deemed harmful by the model. However, jailbreak prompts can often bypass these refusal mechanisms and elicit harmful responses. In this work, we study the extent to which information accessed via jailbreak prompts is decodable using linear probes trained on LM hidden states. We show that a great deal of initially refused information is linearly decodable. For example, across models, the response of a jailbroken LM for the average IQ of a country can be predicted by a linear probe with Pearson correlations exceeding $0.8$. Surprisingly, we find that probes trained on base models (which do not refuse) sometimes transfer to their instruction-tuned versions and are capable of revealing information that jailbreaks decode generatively, suggesting that the internal representations of many refused properties persist from base LMs through instruction-tuning. Importantly, we show that this information is not merely "leftover" in instruction-tuned models, but is actively used by them: we find that probe-predicted values correlate with LM generated pairwise comparisons, indicating that the information decoded by our probes align with suppressed generative behavior that may be expressed more subtly in other downstream tasks. Overall, our results suggest that instruction-tuning does not wholly eliminate or even relocate harmful information in representation space-they merely suppress its direct expression, leaving it both linearly accessible and indirectly influential in downstream behavior.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for real-time sign language recognition using lightweight DNNs trained on limited data. Our system addresses key challenges in sign language recognition, including data scarcity, high computational costs, and discrepancies in frame rates between training and inference environments. By encoding sign language specific parameters, such as handshape, palm orientation, movement, and location into vectorized inputs, and leveraging MediaPipe for landmark extraction, we achieve highly separable input data representations. Our DNN architecture, optimized for sub 10MB deployment, enables accurate classification of 343 signs with less than 10ms latency on edge devices. The data annotation platform 'slait data' facilitates structured labeling and vector extraction. Our model achieved 92% accuracy in isolated sign recognition and has been integrated into the 'slait ai' web application, where it demonstrates stable inference.

Abstract: In recent years, \emph{Reinforcement Learning} (RL) has made remarkable progress, achieving superhuman performance in a wide range of simulated environments. As research moves toward deploying RL in real-world applications, the field faces a new set of challenges inherent to real-world settings, such as large state-action spaces, non-stationarity, and partial observability. Despite their importance, these challenges are often underexplored in current benchmarks, which tend to focus on idealized, fully observable, and stationary environments, often neglecting to incorporate real-world complexities explicitly. In this paper, we introduce \texttt{Gym4ReaL}, a comprehensive suite of realistic environments designed to support the development and evaluation of RL algorithms that can operate in real-world scenarios. The suite includes a diverse set of tasks that expose algorithms to a variety of practical challenges. Our experimental results show that, in these settings, standard RL algorithms confirm their competitiveness against rule-based benchmarks, motivating the development of new methods to fully exploit the potential of RL to tackle the complexities of real-world tasks.

Abstract: As the capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the "pre-train and fine-tune" paradigm has become increasingly mainstream, leading to the development of various fine-tuning methods. However, the privacy risks arising from memorization during fine-tuning have received relatively little attention. To address this gap, we categorize popular fine-tuning approaches and assess their impact on memorization through the lens of membership inference attacks (MIAs). Our results show that, compared to parameter-based fine-tuning, prompt-based fine-tuning achieves competitive performance while exhibiting lower vulnerability to MIAs. Furthermore, prompt-based methods maintain low memorization regardless of model scale. These findings suggest that parameter-based fine-tuning is more prone to leaking private information, whereas prompt-based fine-tuning serves as a more privacy-preserving option.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a powerful tool for complex decision-making in machine learning and AI. However, traditional methods often assume perfect action execution, overlooking the uncertainties and deviations between an agent's selected actions and the actual system response. In real-world applications, such as robotics, mechatronics, and communication networks, execution mismatches arising from system dynamics, hardware constraints, and latency can significantly degrade performance. This work advances AI by developing a novel control-optimized DRL framework that explicitly models and compensates for action execution mismatches, a challenge largely overlooked in existing methods. Our approach establishes a structured two-stage process: determining the desired action and selecting the appropriate control signal to ensure proper execution. It trains the agent while accounting for action mismatches and controller corrections. By incorporating these factors into the training process, the AI agent optimizes the desired action with respect to both the actual control signal and the intended outcome, explicitly considering execution errors. This approach enhances robustness, ensuring that decision-making remains effective under real-world uncertainties. Our approach offers a substantial advancement for engineering practice by bridging the gap between idealized learning and real-world implementation. It equips intelligent agents operating in engineering environments with the ability to anticipate and adjust for actuation errors and system disturbances during training. We evaluate the framework in five widely used open-source mechanical simulation environments we restructured and developed to reflect real-world operating conditions, showcasing its robustness against uncertainties and offering a highly practical and efficient solution for control-oriented applications.

Abstract: Current sparse autoencoder (SAE) approaches to neural network interpretability assume that activations can be decomposed through linear superposition into sparse, interpretable features. Despite high reconstruction fidelity, SAEs consistently fail to eliminate polysemanticity and exhibit pathological behavioral errors. We propose that neural networks encode information in two complementary spaces compressed into the same substrate: feature identity and feature integration. To test this dual encoding hypothesis, we develop sequential and joint-training architectures to capture identity and integration patterns simultaneously. Joint training achieves 41.3% reconstruction improvement and 51.6% reduction in KL divergence errors. This architecture spontaneously develops bimodal feature organization: low squared norm features contributing to integration pathways and the rest contributing directly to the residual. Small nonlinear components (3% of parameters) achieve 16.5% standalone improvements, demonstrating parameter-efficient capture of computational relationships crucial for behavior. Additionally, intervention experiments using 2x2 factorial stimulus designs demonstrated that integration features exhibit selective sensitivity to experimental manipulations and produce systematic behavioral effects on model outputs, including significant interaction effects across semantic dimensions. This work provides systematic evidence for (1) dual encoding in neural representations, (2) meaningful nonlinearly encoded feature interactions, and (3) introduces an architectural paradigm shift from post-hoc feature analysis to integrated computational design, establishing foundations for next-generation SAEs.

Abstract: Overestimation is pervasive in reinforcement learning (RL), including in Q-learning, which forms the algorithmic basis for many value-based deep RL algorithms. Double Q-learning is an algorithm introduced to address Q-learning's overestimation by training two Q-functions and using both to de-correlate action-selection and action-evaluation in bootstrap targets. Shortly after Q-learning was adapted to deep RL in the form of deep Q-networks (DQN), Double Q-learning was adapted to deep RL in the form of Double DQN. However, Double DQN only loosely adapts Double Q-learning, forgoing the training of two different Q-functions that bootstrap off one another. In this paper, we study algorithms that adapt this core idea of Double Q-learning for value-based deep RL. We term such algorithms Deep Double Q-learning (DDQL). Our aim is to understand whether DDQL exhibits less overestimation than Double DQN and whether performant instantiations of DDQL exist. We answer both questions affirmatively, demonstrating that DDQL reduces overestimation and outperforms Double DQN in aggregate across 57 Atari 2600 games, without requiring additional hyperparameters. We also study several aspects of DDQL, including its network architecture, replay ratio, and minibatch sampling strategy.

Abstract: Blind and low vision (BLV) individuals use Generative AI (GenAI) tools to interpret and manage visual content in their daily lives. While such tools can enhance the accessibility of visual content and so enable greater user independence, they also introduce complex challenges around visual privacy. In this paper, we investigate the current practices and future design preferences of blind and low vision individuals through an interview study with 21 participants. Our findings reveal a range of current practices with GenAI that balance privacy, efficiency, and emotional agency, with users accounting for privacy risks across six key scenarios, such as self-presentation, indoor/outdoor spatial privacy, social sharing, and handling professional content. Our findings reveal design preferences, including on-device processing, zero-retention guarantees, sensitive content redaction, privacy-aware appearance indicators, and multimodal tactile mirrored interaction methods. We conclude with actionable design recommendations to support user-centered visual privacy through GenAI, expanding the notion of privacy and responsible handling of others data.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of multi-view radiographs is crucial for diagnosing fractures, muscular injuries, and other anomalies. While significant advances have been made in AI-based analysis of single images, current methods often struggle to establish robust correspondences between different X-ray views, an essential capability for precise clinical evaluations. In this work, we present a novel self-supervised pipeline that eliminates the need for manual annotation by automatically generating a many-to-many correspondence matrix between synthetic X-ray views. This is achieved using digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRR), which are automatically derived from unannotated CT volumes. Our approach incorporates a transformer-based training phase to accurately predict correspondences across two or more X-ray views. Furthermore, we demonstrate that learning correspondences among synthetic X-ray views can be leveraged as a pretraining strategy to enhance automatic multi-view fracture detection on real data. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real X-ray datasets show that incorporating correspondences improves performance in multi-view fracture classification.

Abstract: This study explores how AI-powered digital innovations are reshaping organisational accountability in a transnational governance context. As AI systems increasingly mediate decision-making in domains such as auditing and financial reporting, traditional mechanisms of accountability, based on control, transparency, and auditability, are being destabilised. We integrate the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Actor-Network Theory (ANT), and institutional theory to examine how organisations adopt AI technologies in response to regulatory, ethical, and cultural pressures that transcend national boundaries. We argue that accountability is co-constructed within global socio-technical networks, shaped not only by user perceptions but also by governance logics and normative expectations. Extending TAM, we incorporate compliance and legitimacy as key factors in perceived usefulness and usability. Drawing on ANT, we reconceptualise accountability as a relational and emergent property of networked assemblages. We propose two organisational strategies including internal governance reconfiguration and external actor-network engagement to foster responsible, legitimate, and globally accepted AI adoption in the accounting domain.

Abstract: Digital pathology has revolutionized the field by enabling the digitization of tissue samples into whole slide images (WSIs). However, the high resolution and large size of WSIs present significant challenges when it comes to applying Deep Learning models. As a solution, WSIs are often divided into smaller patches with a global label (\textit{i.e., diagnostic}) per slide, instead of a (too) costly pixel-wise annotation. By treating each slide as a bag of patches, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods have emerged as a suitable solution for WSI classification. A major drawback of MIL methods is their high variability in performance across different runs, which can reach up to 10-15 AUC points on the test set, making it difficult to compare different MIL methods reliably. This variability mainly comes from three factors: i) weight initialization, ii) batch (shuffling) ordering, iii) and learning rate. To address that, we introduce a Multi-Fidelity, Model Fusion strategy for MIL methods. We first train multiple models for a few epochs and average the most stable and promising ones based on validation scores. This approach can be applied to any existing MIL model to reduce performance variability. It also simplifies hyperparameter tuning and improves reproducibility while maintaining computational efficiency. We extensively validate our approach on WSI classification tasks using 2 different datasets, 3 initialization strategies and 5 MIL methods, for a total of more than 2000 experiments.

Abstract: Recent advances in word embeddings and language models use large-scale, unlabelled data and self-supervised learning to boost NLP performance. Multilingual models, often trained on web-sourced data like Wikipedia, face challenges: few low-resource languages are included, their data is often noisy, and lack of labeled datasets makes it hard to evaluate performance outside high-resource languages like English. In this dissertation, we focus on languages spoken in Sub-Saharan Africa where all the indigenous languages in this region can be regarded as low-resourced in terms of the availability of labelled data for NLP tasks and unlabelled data found on the web. We analyse the noise in the publicly available corpora, and curate a high-quality corpus, demonstrating that the quality of semantic representations learned in word embeddings does not only depend on the amount of data but on the quality of pre-training data. We demonstrate empirically the limitations of word embeddings, and the opportunities the multilingual pre-trained language model (PLM) offers especially for languages unseen during pre-training and low-resource scenarios. We further study how to adapt and specialize multilingual PLMs to unseen African languages using a small amount of monolingual texts. To address the under-representation of the African languages in NLP research, we developed large scale human-annotated labelled datasets for 21 African languages in two impactful NLP tasks: named entity recognition and machine translation. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation using state-of-the-art methods across supervised, weakly-supervised, and transfer learning settings.

Abstract: The promise of autonomous scientific discovery (ASD) hinges not only on answering questions, but also on knowing which questions to ask. Most recent works in ASD explore the use of large language models (LLMs) in goal-driven settings, relying on human-specified research questions to guide hypothesis generation. However, scientific discovery may be accelerated further by allowing the AI system to drive exploration by its own criteria. The few existing approaches in open-ended ASD select hypotheses based on diversity heuristics or subjective proxies for human interestingness, but the former struggles to meaningfully navigate the typically vast hypothesis space, and the latter suffers from imprecise definitions. This paper presents AutoDS -- a method for open-ended ASD that instead drives scientific exploration using Bayesian surprise. Here, we quantify the epistemic shift from the LLM's prior beliefs about a hypothesis to its posterior beliefs after gathering experimental results. To efficiently explore the space of nested hypotheses, our method employs a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) strategy with progressive widening using surprisal as the reward function. We evaluate AutoDS in the setting of data-driven discovery across 21 real-world datasets spanning domains such as biology, economics, finance, and behavioral science. Our results demonstrate that under a fixed budget, AutoDS substantially outperforms competitors by producing 5--29\% more discoveries deemed surprising by the LLM. Our human evaluation further finds that two-thirds of AutoDS discoveries are surprising to the domain experts, suggesting this is an important step forward towards building open-ended ASD systems.

<title>Failure by Interference: Language Models Make Balanced Parentheses Errors When Faulty Mechanisms Overshadow Sound Ones</title>

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances in coding capabilities, language models (LMs) still struggle with simple syntactic tasks such as generating balanced parentheses. In this study, we investigate the underlying mechanisms behind the persistence of these errors across LMs of varying sizes (124M-7B) to both understand and mitigate the errors. Our study reveals that LMs rely on a number of components (attention heads and FF neurons) that independently make their own predictions. While some components reliably promote correct answers across a generalized range of inputs (i.e., implementing "sound mechanisms''), others are less reliable and introduce noise by promoting incorrect tokens (i.e., implementing "faulty mechanisms''). Errors occur when the faulty mechanisms overshadow the sound ones and dominantly affect the predictions. Motivated by this insight, we introduce RASteer, a steering method to systematically identify and increase the contribution of reliable components for improving model performance. RASteer substantially improves performance on balanced parentheses tasks, boosting accuracy of some models from $0$% to around $100$% without impairing the models' general coding ability. We further demonstrate its broader applicability in arithmetic reasoning tasks, achieving performance gains of up to around $20$%.

Abstract: Amodal segmentation and amodal content completion require using object priors to estimate occluded masks and features of objects in complex scenes. Until now, no data has provided an additional dimension for object context: the possibility of multiple cameras sharing a view of a scene. We introduce MOVi-MC-AC: Multiple Object Video with Multi-Cameras and Amodal Content, the largest amodal segmentation and first amodal content dataset to date. Cluttered scenes of generic household objects are simulated in multi-camera video. MOVi-MC-AC contributes to the growing literature of object detection, tracking, and segmentation by including two new contributions to the deep learning for computer vision world. Multiple Camera (MC) settings where objects can be identified and tracked between various unique camera perspectives are rare in both synthetic and real-world video. We introduce a new complexity to synthetic video by providing consistent object ids for detections and segmentations between both frames and multiple cameras each with unique features and motion patterns on a single scene. Amodal Content (AC) is a reconstructive task in which models predict the appearance of target objects through occlusions. In the amodal segmentation literature, some datasets have been released with amodal detection, tracking, and segmentation labels. While other methods rely on slow cut-and-paste schemes to generate amodal content pseudo-labels, they do not account for natural occlusions present in the modal masks. MOVi-MC-AC provides labels for ~5.8 million object instances, setting a new maximum in the amodal dataset literature, along with being the first to provide ground-truth amodal content. The full dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Amar-S/MOVi-MC-AC ,

Abstract: Modern firms face a flood of dense, unstructured reports. Turning these documents into usable insights takes heavy effort and is far from agile when quick answers are needed. VTS-AI tackles this gap. It integrates Visual Thinking Strategies, which emphasize evidence-based observation, linking, and thinking, into AI agents, so the agents can extract business insights from unstructured text, tables, and images at scale. The system works in three tiers (micro, meso, macro). It tags issues, links them to source pages, and rolls them into clear action levers stored in a searchable YAML file. In tests on an 18-page business report, VTS-AI matched the speed of a one-shot ChatGPT prompt yet produced richer findings: page locations, verbatim excerpts, severity scores, and causal links. Analysts can accept or adjust these outputs in the same IDE, keeping human judgment in the loop. Early results show VTS-AI spots the direction of key metrics and flags where deeper number-crunching is needed. Next steps include mapping narrative tags to financial ratios, adding finance-tuned language models through a Model-Context Protocol, and building a Risk & Safety Layer to stress-test models and secure data. These upgrades aim to make VTS-AI a production-ready, audit-friendly tool for rapid business analysis.

Abstract: Standard Verification Rule Format (SVRF) is essential for semiconductor applications like Design Rule Check (DRC), Layout Versus Schematic (LVS), and Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) and it faces challenges as advancing nodes create complex design rules that renders traditional SVRF development ineffective and highlight an expertise gap. This paper introduces a novel methodology integrating Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) embedding and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for enhanced SVRF code synthesis, ensuring semantic accuracy and error minimization through structural validation with domain-specific insights for precise code generation.
  We evaluate different T5-based models and propose an innovative SVRF-specific scoring framework that complements standard metrics like BLEU and ROUGE-L. In our approach, AST provides rigorous structural validation, while RAG infuses relevant domain knowledge, effectively enhancing the code generation workflow.
  Testing on a comprehensive benchmark of 740 DRC rule implementations, our methodology demonstrates up to a 40\% improvement in code generation accuracy compared to basic text-based fine-tuning process. This fusion of industry expertise with advanced coding strategies not only optimizes SVRF development under limited dataset constraints but also creates a more intuitive and efficient coding environment. Consequently, users can rapidly iterate through design cycles, reduce manual error correction, and significantly improve overall productivity.

Abstract: Deep learning methods have significantly advanced the development of intelligent rinterpretation in remote sensing (RS), with foundational model research based on large-scale pre-training paradigms rapidly reshaping various domains of Earth Observation (EO). However, compared to the open accessibility and high spatiotemporal coverage of medium-resolution data, the limited acquisition channels for ultra-high-resolution optical RS imagery have constrained the progress of high-resolution remote sensing vision foundation models (RSVFM). As the world's largest sub-meter-level commercial RS satellite constellation, the Jilin-1 constellation possesses abundant sub-meter-level image resources. This study proposes CGEarthEye, a RSVFM framework specifically designed for Jilin-1 satellite characteristics, comprising five backbones with different parameter scales with totaling 2.1 billion parameters. To enhance the representational capacity of the foundation model, we developed JLSSD, the first 15-million-scale multi-temporal self-supervised learning (SSL) dataset featuring global coverage with quarterly temporal sampling within a single year, constructed through multi-level representation clustering and sampling strategies. The framework integrates seasonal contrast, augmentation-based contrast, and masked patch token contrastive strategies for pre-training. Comprehensive evaluations across 10 benchmark datasets covering four typical RS tasks demonstrate that the CGEarthEye consistently achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Further analysis reveals CGEarthEye's superior characteristics in feature visualization, model convergence, parameter efficiency, and practical mapping applications. This study anticipates that the exceptional representation capabilities of CGEarthEye will facilitate broader and more efficient applications of Jilin-1 data in traditional EO application.

<title>Data-Driven Exploration for a Class of Continuous-Time Linear--Quadratic Reinforcement Learning Problems</title>

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) for the same class of continuous-time stochastic linear--quadratic (LQ) control problems as in \cite{huang2024sublinear}, where volatilities depend on both states and controls while states are scalar-valued and running control rewards are absent. We propose a model-free, data-driven exploration mechanism that adaptively adjusts entropy regularization by the critic and policy variance by the actor. Unlike the constant or deterministic exploration schedules employed in \cite{huang2024sublinear}, which require extensive tuning for implementations and ignore learning progresses during iterations, our adaptive exploratory approach boosts learning efficiency with minimal tuning. Despite its flexibility, our method achieves a sublinear regret bound that matches the best-known model-free results for this class of LQ problems, which were previously derived only with fixed exploration schedules. Numerical experiments demonstrate that adaptive explorations accelerate convergence and improve regret performance compared to the non-adaptive model-free and model-based counterparts.

Abstract: Conformance testing is essential for ensuring that protocol implementations comply with their specifications. However, traditional testing approaches involve manually creating numerous test cases and scripts, making the process labor-intensive and inefficient. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive text comprehension and code generation abilities, providing promising opportunities for automation. In this paper, we propose iPanda, the first end-to-end framework that leverages LLMs to automate protocol conformance testing. Given a protocol specification document and its implementation, iPanda first employs a keyword-based method to automatically generate comprehensive test cases. Then, it utilizes a code-based retrieval-augmented generation approach to effectively interpret the implementation and produce executable test code. To further enhance code quality, iPanda incorporates an iterative self-correction mechanism to refine generated test scripts interactively. Finally, by executing and analyzing the generated tests, iPanda systematically verifies compliance between implementations and protocol specifications. Comprehensive experiments on various protocols show that iPanda significantly outperforms pure LLM-based approaches, improving the success rate (Pass@1) of test-code generation by factors ranging from 4.675 times to 10.751 times.

Abstract: Accurate molecular property predictions require 3D geometries, which are typically obtained using expensive methods such as density functional theory (DFT). Here, we attempt to obtain molecular geometries by relying solely on machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) models. To this end, we first curate a large-scale molecular relaxation dataset comprising 3.5 million molecules and 300 million snapshots. Then MLIP foundation models are trained with supervised learning to predict energy and forces given 3D molecular structures. Once trained, we show that the foundation models can be used in different ways to obtain geometries either explicitly or implicitly. First, it can be used to obtain low-energy 3D geometries via geometry optimization, providing relaxed 3D geometries for downstream molecular property predictions. To mitigate potential biases and enhance downstream predictions, we introduce geometry fine-tuning based on the relaxed 3D geometries. Second, the foundation models can be directly fine-tuned for property prediction when ground truth 3D geometries are available. Our results demonstrate that MLIP foundation models trained on relaxation data can provide valuable molecular geometries that benefit property predictions.

Abstract: Understanding Earth's subsurface is critical for energy transition, natural hazard mitigation, and planetary science. Yet subsurface analysis remains fragmented, with separate models required for structural interpretation, stratigraphic analysis, geobody segmentation, and property modeling-each tightly coupled to specific data distributions and task formulations. We introduce the Geological Everything Model 3D (GEM), a unified generative architecture that reformulates all these tasks as prompt-conditioned inference along latent structural frameworks derived from subsurface imaging. This formulation moves beyond task-specific models by enabling a shared inference mechanism, where GEM propagates human-provided prompts-such as well logs, masks, or structural sketches-along inferred structural frameworks to produce geologically coherent outputs. Through this mechanism, GEM achieves zero-shot generalization across tasks with heterogeneous prompt types, without retraining for new tasks or data sources. This capability emerges from a two-stage training process that combines self-supervised representation learning on large-scale field seismic data with adversarial fine-tuning using mixed prompts and labels across diverse subsurface tasks. GEM demonstrates broad applicability across surveys and tasks, including Martian radar stratigraphy analysis, structural interpretation in subduction zones, full seismic stratigraphic interpretation, geobody delineation, and property modeling. By bridging expert knowledge with generative reasoning in a structurally aware manner, GEM lays the foundation for scalable, human-in-the-loop geophysical AI-transitioning from fragmented pipelines to a vertically integrated, promptable reasoning system.

Abstract: We present RoboEval, a simulation benchmark and structured evaluation framework designed to reveal the limitations of current bimanual manipulation policies. While prior benchmarks report only binary task success, we show that such metrics often conceal critical weaknesses in policy behavior -- such as poor coordination, slipping during grasping, or asymmetric arm usage. RoboEval introduces a suite of tiered, semantically grounded tasks decomposed into skill-specific stages, with variations that systematically challenge spatial, physical, and coordination capabilities. Tasks are paired with fine-grained diagnostic metrics and 3000+ human demonstrations to support imitation learning. Our experiments reveal that policies with similar success rates diverge in how tasks are executed -- some struggle with alignment, others with temporally consistent bimanual control. We find that behavioral metrics correlate with success in over half of task-metric pairs, and remain informative even when binary success saturates. By pinpointing when and how policies fail, RoboEval enables a deeper, more actionable understanding of robotic manipulation -- and highlights the need for evaluation tools that go beyond success alone.

Abstract: Through recognizing causal subgraphs, causal graph learning (CGL) has risen to be a promising approach for improving the generalizability of graph neural networks under out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. However, the empirical successes of CGL techniques are mostly exemplified in classification settings, while regression tasks, a more challenging setting in graph learning, are overlooked. We thus devote this work to tackling causal graph regression (CGR); to this end we reshape the processing of confounding effects in existing CGL studies, which mainly deal with classification. Specifically, we reflect on the predictive power of confounders in graph-level regression, and generalize classification-specific causal intervention techniques to regression through a lens of contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on graph OOD benchmarks validate the efficacy of our proposals for CGR. The model implementation and the code are provided on https://github.com/causal-graph/CGR.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-agent systems manipulation have demonstrated a rising demand for the implementation of multi-UAV systems in urban areas, which are always subjected to the presence of static and dynamic obstacles. Inspired by the collective behavior of tilapia fish and pigeons, the focus of the presented research is on the introduction of a nature-inspired collision-free formation control for a multi-UAV system, considering the obstacle avoidance maneuvers. The developed framework in this study utilizes a semi-distributed control approach, in which, based on a probabilistic Lloyd's algorithm, a centralized guidance algorithm works for optimal positioning of the UAVs, while a distributed control approach has been used for the intervehicle collision and obstacle avoidance. Further, the presented framework has been extended to the 3D space with a novel definition of 3D maneuvers. Finally, the presented framework has been applied to multi-UAV systems in 2D and 3D scenarios, and the obtained results demonstrated the validity of the presented method in dynamic environments with stationary and moving obstacles.

Abstract: We address the problem of fine-tuning diffusion models for reward-guided generation in biomolecular design. While diffusion models have proven highly effective in modeling complex, high-dimensional data distributions, real-world applications often demand more than high-fidelity generation, requiring optimization with respect to potentially non-differentiable reward functions such as physics-based simulation or rewards based on scientific knowledge. Although RL methods have been explored to fine-tune diffusion models for such objectives, they often suffer from instability, low sample efficiency, and mode collapse due to their on-policy nature. In this work, we propose an iterative distillation-based fine-tuning framework that enables diffusion models to optimize for arbitrary reward functions. Our method casts the problem as policy distillation: it collects off-policy data during the roll-in phase, simulates reward-based soft-optimal policies during roll-out, and updates the model by minimizing the KL divergence between the simulated soft-optimal policy and the current model policy. Our off-policy formulation, combined with KL divergence minimization, enhances training stability and sample efficiency compared to existing RL-based methods. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness and superior reward optimization of our approach across diverse tasks in protein, small molecule, and regulatory DNA design.

Abstract: We present an efficient and generalised procedure to accurately identify the best performing algorithm for each sub-task in a multi-problem domain. Our approach treats this as a set of best arm identification problems for multi-armed bandits, where each bandit corresponds to a specific task and each arm corresponds to a specific algorithm or agent. We propose an optimistic selection process based on the Wilson score interval (Optimistic-WS) that ranks each arm across all bandits in terms of their potential regret reduction. We evaluate the performance of Optimistic-WS on two of the most popular general game domains, the General Video Game AI (GVGAI) framework and the Ludii general game playing system, with the goal of identifying the highest performing agent for each game within a limited number of trials. Compared to previous best arm identification algorithms for multi-armed bandits, our results demonstrate a substantial performance improvement in terms of average simple regret. This novel approach can be used to significantly improve the quality and accuracy of agent evaluation procedures for general game frameworks, as well as other multi-task domains with high algorithm runtimes.

Abstract: A main challenge of Visual-Language Tracking (VLT) is the misalignment between visual inputs and language descriptions caused by target movement. Previous trackers have explored many effective feature modification methods to preserve more aligned features. However, an important yet unexplored factor ultimately hinders their capability, which is the inherent differences in the temporal and spatial scale of information between visual and language inputs. To address this issue, we propose a novel visual-language tracker that enhances the effect of feature modification by \textbf{A}ligning \textbf{T}emporal and \textbf{S}patial scale of different input components, named as \textbf{ATSTrack}. Specifically, we decompose each language description into phrases with different attributes based on their temporal and spatial correspondence with visual inputs, and modify their features in a fine-grained manner. Moreover, we introduce a Visual-Language token that comprises modified linguistic information from the previous frame to guide the model to extract visual features that are more relevant to language description, thereby reducing the impact caused by the differences in spatial scale. Experimental results show that our proposed ATSTrack achieves performance comparable to existing methods. Our code will be released.

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic microstructure images conditioned on processing parameters is crucial for understanding process-structure relationships in materials design. However, this task remains challenging due to limited training micrographs and the continuous nature of processing variables. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel process-aware generative modeling approach based on Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large (SD3.5-Large), a state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model adapted for microstructure generation. Our method introduces numeric-aware embeddings that encode continuous variables (annealing temperature, time, and magnification) directly into the model's conditioning, enabling controlled image generation under specified process conditions and capturing process-driven microstructural variations. To address data scarcity and computational constraints, we fine-tune only a small fraction of the model's weights via DreamBooth and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), efficiently transferring the pre-trained model to the materials domain. We validate realism using a semantic segmentation model based on a fine-tuned U-Net with a VGG16 encoder on 24 labeled micrographs. It achieves 97.1% accuracy and 85.7% mean IoU, outperforming previous methods. Quantitative analyses using physical descriptors and spatial statistics show strong agreement between synthetic and real microstructures. Specifically, two-point correlation and lineal-path errors remain below 2.1% and 0.6%, respectively. Our method represents the first adaptation of SD3.5-Large for process-aware microstructure generation, offering a scalable approach for data-driven materials design.

Abstract: This research paper introduces two novel complex-valued Hopfield neural networks (CvHNNs) that incorporate phase and magnitude quantization. The first CvHNN employs a ceiling-type activation function that operates on the rectangular coordinate representation of the complex net contribution. The second CvHNN similarly incorporates phase and magnitude quantization but utilizes a ceiling-type activation function based on the polar coordinate representation of the complex net contribution. The proposed CvHNNs, with their phase and magnitude quantization, significantly increase the number of states compared to existing models in the literature, thereby expanding the range of potential applications for CvHNNs.

Abstract: Random Forest (RF) is a widely used ensemble learning technique known for its robust classification performance across diverse domains. However, it often relies on hundreds of trees and all input features, leading to high inference cost and model redundancy. In this work, our goal is to grow trees dynamically only on informative features and then enforce maximal diversity by clustering and retaining uncorrelated trees. Therefore, we propose a Refined Random Forest Classifier that iteratively refines itself by first removing the least informative features and then analytically determines how many new trees should be grown, followed by correlation-based clustering to remove redundant trees. The classification accuracy of our model was compared against the standard RF on the same number of trees. Experiments on 8 multiple benchmark datasets, including binary and multiclass datasets, demonstrate that the proposed model achieves improved accuracy compared to standard RF.

Abstract: Inline holographic imaging presents an ill-posed inverse problem of reconstructing objects' complex amplitude from recorded diffraction patterns. Although recent deep learning approaches have shown promise over classical phase retrieval algorithms, they often require high-quality ground truth datasets of complex amplitude maps to achieve a statistical inverse mapping operation between the two domains. Here, we present a physics-aware style transfer approach that interprets the object-to-sensor distance as an implicit style within diffraction patterns. Using the style domain as the intermediate domain to construct cyclic image translation, we show that the inverse mapping operation can be learned in an adaptive manner only with datasets composed of intensity measurements. We further demonstrate its biomedical applicability by reconstructing the morphology of dynamically flowing red blood cells, highlighting its potential for real-time, label-free imaging. As a framework that leverages physical cues inherently embedded in measurements, the presented method offers a practical learning strategy for imaging applications where ground truth is difficult or impossible to obtain.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is widely used in tasks where agents interact with an environment to maximize rewards. Building on this foundation, Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) incorporates a cost metric alongside the reward metric, ensuring that agents adhere to safety constraints during decision-making. In this paper, we identify that Safe RL is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which can manipulate agents into performing unsafe actions. First, we introduce the relevant concepts and evaluation metrics for backdoor attacks in Safe RL. It is the first attack framework in the Safe RL field that involves both Positive and Negative Action sample (PNAct) is to implant backdoors, where positive action samples provide reference actions and negative action samples indicate actions to be avoided. We theoretically point out the properties of PNAct and design an attack algorithm. Finally, we conduct experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed backdoor attack framework, evaluating it with the established metrics. This paper highlights the potential risks associated with Safe RL and underscores the feasibility of such attacks. Our code and supplementary material are available at https://github.com/azure-123/PNAct.

Abstract: Compound AI (cAI) systems chain multiple AI models to solve complex problems. cAI systems are typically composed of deep neural networks (DNNs), transformers, and large language models (LLMs), exhibiting a high degree of computational diversity and dynamic workload variation. Deploying cAI services on mobile edge platforms poses a significant challenge in scheduling concurrent DNN-transformer inference tasks, which arrive dynamically in an unknown sequence. Existing mobile edge AI inference strategies manage multi-DNN or transformer-only workloads, relying on design-time profiling, and cannot handle concurrent inference of DNNs and transformers required by cAI systems. In this work, we address the challenge of scheduling cAI systems on heterogeneous mobile edge platforms. We present Twill, a run-time framework to handle concurrent inference requests of cAI workloads through task affinity-aware cluster mapping and migration, priority-aware task freezing/unfreezing, and DVFS, while minimizing inference latency within power budgets. We implement and deploy our Twill framework on the Nvidia Jetson Orin NX platform. We evaluate Twill against state-of-the-art edge AI inference techniques over contemporary DNNs and LLMs, reducing inference latency by 54% on average, while honoring power budgets.

<title>Visual Anagrams Reveal Hidden Differences in Holistic Shape Processing Across Vision Models</title>

Abstract: Humans are able to recognize objects based on both local texture cues and the configuration of object parts, yet contemporary vision models primarily harvest local texture cues, yielding brittle, non-compositional features. Work on shape-vs-texture bias has pitted shape and texture representations in opposition, measuring shape relative to texture, ignoring the possibility that models (and humans) can simultaneously rely on both types of cues, and obscuring the absolute quality of both types of representation. We therefore recast shape evaluation as a matter of absolute configural competence, operationalized by the Configural Shape Score (CSS), which (i) measures the ability to recognize both images in Object-Anagram pairs that preserve local texture while permuting global part arrangement to depict different object categories. Across 86 convolutional, transformer, and hybrid models, CSS (ii) uncovers a broad spectrum of configural sensitivity with fully self-supervised and language-aligned transformers -- exemplified by DINOv2, SigLIP2 and EVA-CLIP -- occupying the top end of the CSS spectrum. Mechanistic probes reveal that (iii) high-CSS networks depend on long-range interactions: radius-controlled attention masks abolish performance showing a distinctive U-shaped integration profile, and representational-similarity analyses expose a mid-depth transition from local to global coding. A BagNet control remains at chance (iv), ruling out "border-hacking" strategies. Finally, (v) we show that configural shape score also predicts other shape-dependent evals. Overall, we propose that the path toward truly robust, generalizable, and human-like vision systems may not lie in forcing an artificial choice between shape and texture, but rather in architectural and learning frameworks that seamlessly integrate both local-texture and global configural shape.

Abstract: As conversational search engines increasingly adopt generation-based paradigms powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the integration of advertisements into generated responses presents both commercial opportunities and challenges for user experience. Unlike traditional search, where advertisements are clearly delineated, generative systems blur the boundary between informational content and promotional material, raising concerns around transparency and trust. In this work, we propose a modular pipeline for advertisement management in RAG-based conversational systems, consisting of an ad-rewriter for seamless ad integration and a robust ad-classifier for detection. We leverage synthetic data to train high-performing classifiers, which are then used to guide two complementary ad-integration strategies: supervised fine-tuning of the ad-rewriter and a best-of-N sampling approach that selects the least detectable ad-integrated response among multiple candidates. Our evaluation focuses on two core questions: the effectiveness of ad classifiers in detecting diverse ad integration strategies, and the training methods that best support coherent, minimally intrusive ad insertion. Experimental results show that our ad-classifier, trained on synthetic advertisement data inspired by marketing strategies and enhanced through curriculum learning, achieves robust detection performance. Additionally, we demonstrate that classifier-guided optimization, through both fine-tuning and best-of-N sampling, significantly improves ad stealth, enabling more seamless integration. These findings contribute an adversarial co-evolution framework for developing more sophisticated ad-aware generative search systems and robust ad classifiers.

Abstract: The integration of various AI tools creates a complex socio-technical environment where employee-customer interactions form the core of work practices. This study investigates how customer service representatives (CSRs) at the power grid service customer service call center perceive AI assistance in their interactions with customers. Through a field visit and semi-structured interviews with 13 CSRs, we found that AI can alleviate some traditional burdens during the call (e.g., typing and memorizing) but also introduces new burdens (e.g., earning, compliance, psychological burdens). This research contributes to a more nuanced understanding of AI integration in organizational settings and highlights the efforts and burdens undertaken by CSRs to adapt to the updated system.

Abstract: Interpretable communication is essential for safe and trustworthy autonomous driving, yet current vision-language models (VLMs) often operate under idealized assumptions and struggle to capture user intent in real-world scenarios. Existing driving-oriented VQA datasets are limited to full-scene descriptions or waypoint prediction, preventing the assessment of whether VLMs can respond to localized user-driven queries. We introduce Box-QAymo, a box-referring dataset and benchmark designed to both evaluate and finetune VLMs on spatial and temporal reasoning over user-specified objects. Users express intent by drawing bounding boxes, offering a fast and intuitive interface for focused queries in complex scenes. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical evaluation protocol that begins with binary sanity-check questions to assess basic model capacities, and progresses to (1) attribute prediction for box-referred objects, (2) motion understanding of target instances, and (3) spatiotemporal motion reasoning over inter-object dynamics across frames. To support this, we crowd-sourced fine-grained object classes and visual attributes that reflect the complexity drivers encounter, and extract object trajectories to construct temporally grounded QA pairs. Rigorous quality control through negative sampling, temporal consistency checks, and difficulty-aware balancing guarantee dataset robustness and diversity. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals significant limitations in current VLMs when queried about perception questions, highlighting the gap in achieving real-world performance. This work provides a foundation for developing more robust and interpretable autonomous driving systems that can communicate effectively with users under real-world conditions.

<title>Rethinking Group Recommender Systems in the Era of Generative AI: From One-Shot Recommendations to Agentic Group Decision Support</title>

Abstract: More than twenty-five years ago, first ideas were developed on how to design a system that can provide recommendations to groups of users instead of individual users. Since then, a rich variety of algorithmic proposals were published, e.g., on how to acquire individual preferences, how to aggregate them, and how to generate recommendations for groups of users. However, despite the rich literature on the topic, barely any examples of real-world group recommender systems can be found. This lets us question common assumptions in academic research, in particular regarding communication processes in a group and how recommendation-supported decisions are made. In this essay, we argue that these common assumptions and corresponding system designs often may not match the needs or expectations of users. We thus call for a reorientation in this research area, leveraging the capabilities of modern Generative AI assistants like ChatGPT. Specifically, as one promising future direction, we envision group recommender systems to be systems where human group members interact in a chat and an AI-based group recommendation agent assists the decision-making process in an agentic way. Ultimately, this shall lead to a more natural group decision-making environment and finally to wider adoption of group recommendation systems in practice.

<title>Not All Attention Heads Are What You Need: Refining CLIP's Image Representation with Attention Ablation</title>

Abstract: This paper studies the role of attention heads in CLIP's image encoder. While CLIP has exhibited robust performance across diverse applications, we hypothesize that certain attention heads negatively affect final representations and that ablating them can improve performance in downstream tasks. To capitalize on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective method, called Attention Ablation Technique (AAT), to suppress the contribution of specific heads by manipulating attention weights. By integrating two alternative strategies tailored for different application scenarios, AAT systematically identifies and ablates detrimental attention heads to enhance representation quality. Experiments demonstrate that AAT consistently improves downstream task performance across various domains, boosting recall rate by up to 11.1% on CLIP-family models for cross-modal retrieval. The results highlight the potential of AAT to effectively refine large-scale vision-language models with virtually no increase in inference cost.

Abstract: Inverse design in nanophotonics, the computational discovery of structures achieving targeted electromagnetic (EM) responses, has become a key tool for recent optical advances. Traditional intuition-driven or iterative optimization methods struggle with the inherently high-dimensional, non-convex design spaces and the substantial computational demands of EM simulations. Recently, machine learning (ML) has emerged to address these bottlenecks effectively. This review frames ML-enhanced inverse design methodologies through the lens of representation learning, classifying them into two categories: output-side and input-side approaches. Output-side methods use ML to learn a representation in the solution space to create a differentiable solver that accelerates optimization. Conversely, input-side techniques employ ML to learn compact, latent-space representations of feasible device geometries, enabling efficient global exploration through generative models. Each strategy presents unique trade-offs in data requirements, generalization capacity, and novel design discovery potentials. Hybrid frameworks that combine physics-based optimization with data-driven representations help escape poor local optima, improve scalability, and facilitate knowledge transfer. We conclude by highlighting open challenges and opportunities, emphasizing complexity management, geometry-independent representations, integration of fabrication constraints, and advancements in multiphysics co-designs.

Abstract: Vision State Space Models (SSMs), particularly architectures like Vision Mamba (ViM), have emerged as promising alternatives to Vision Transformers (ViTs). However, the security implications of this novel architecture, especially their vulnerability to backdoor attacks, remain critically underexplored. Backdoor attacks aim to embed hidden triggers into victim models, causing the model to misclassify inputs containing these triggers while maintaining normal behavior on clean inputs. This paper investigates the susceptibility of ViM to backdoor attacks by introducing BadViM, a novel backdoor attack framework specifically designed for Vision Mamba. The proposed BadViM leverages a Resonant Frequency Trigger (RFT) that exploits the frequency sensitivity patterns of the victim model to create stealthy, distributed triggers. To maximize attack efficacy, we propose a Hidden State Alignment loss that strategically manipulates the internal representations of model by aligning the hidden states of backdoor images with those of target classes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that BadViM achieves superior attack success rates while maintaining clean data accuracy. Meanwhile, BadViM exhibits remarkable resilience against common defensive measures, including PatchDrop, PatchShuffle and JPEG compression, which typically neutralize normal backdoor attacks.

Abstract: Hallucinations are one of the major problems of LLMs, hindering their trustworthiness and deployment to wider use cases. However, most of the research on hallucinations focuses on English data, neglecting the multilingual nature of LLMs. This paper describes our submission to the SemEval-2025 Task-3 - Mu-SHROOM, the Multilingual Shared-task on Hallucinations and Related Observable Overgeneration Mistakes. We propose a two-part pipeline that combines retrieval-based fact verification against Wikipedia with a BERT-based system fine-tuned to identify common hallucination patterns. Our system achieves competitive results across all languages, reaching top-10 results in eight languages, including English. Moreover, it supports multiple languages beyond the fourteen covered by the shared task. This multilingual hallucination identifier can help to improve LLM outputs and their usefulness in the future.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI enables highly realistic synthetic videos, posing significant challenges for content authentication and raising urgent concerns about misuse. Existing detection methods often struggle with generalization and capturing subtle temporal inconsistencies. We propose ReStraV(Representation Straightening Video), a novel approach to distinguish natural from AI-generated videos. Inspired by the "perceptual straightening" hypothesis -- which suggests real-world video trajectories become more straight in neural representation domain -- we analyze deviations from this expected geometric property. Using a pre-trained self-supervised vision transformer (DINOv2), we quantify the temporal curvature and stepwise distance in the model's representation domain. We aggregate statistics of these measures for each video and train a classifier. Our analysis shows that AI-generated videos exhibit significantly different curvature and distance patterns compared to real videos. A lightweight classifier achieves state-of-the-art detection performance (e.g., 97.17% accuracy and 98.63% AUROC on the VidProM benchmark), substantially outperforming existing image- and video-based methods. ReStraV is computationally efficient, it is offering a low-cost and effective detection solution. This work provides new insights into using neural representation geometry for AI-generated video detection.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal policies through environmental interaction. However, RL suffers from reduced learning efficiency due to the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional spaces. Quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) addresses this issue by leveraging superposition and entanglement in quantum computing, allowing efficient handling of high-dimensional problems with fewer resources. QRL combines quantum neural networks (QNNs) with RL, where the parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) acts as the core computational module. The PQC performs linear and nonlinear transformations through gate operations, similar to hidden layers in classical neural networks. Previous QRL studies, however, have used fixed PQC structures based on empirical intuition without verifying their optimality. This paper proposes a QRL-NAS algorithm that integrates quantum neural architecture search (QNAS) to optimize PQC structures within QRL. Experiments demonstrate that QRL-NAS achieves higher rewards than QRL with fixed circuits, validating its effectiveness and practical utility.

Abstract: Continuous attractor networks (CANs) are widely used to model how the brain temporarily retains continuous behavioural variables via persistent recurrent activity, such as an animal's position in an environment. However, this memory mechanism is very sensitive to even small imperfections, such as noise or heterogeneity, which are both common in biological systems. Previous work has shown that discretising the continuum into a finite set of discrete attractor states provides robustness to these imperfections, but necessarily reduces the resolution of the represented variable, creating a dilemma between stability and resolution. We show that this stability-resolution dilemma is most severe for CANs using unimodal bump-like codes, as in traditional models. To overcome this, we investigate sparse binary distributed codes based on random feature embeddings, in which neurons have spatially-periodic receptive fields. We demonstrate theoretically and with simulations that such grid-cell-like codes enable CANs to achieve both high stability and high resolution simultaneously. The model extends to embedding arbitrary nonlinear manifolds into a CAN, such as spheres or tori, and generalises linear path integration to integration along freely-programmable on-manifold vector fields. Together, this work provides a theory of how the brain could robustly represent continuous variables with high resolution and perform flexible computations over task-relevant manifolds.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in complex tasks through advanced prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT), but their reliance on manually crafted, task-specific prompts limits adaptability and efficiency. We introduce Mixture of Reasoning (MoR), a training framework that embeds diverse reasoning strategies into LLMs for autonomous, task-adaptive reasoning without external prompt engineering. MoR has two phases: Thought Generation, creating reasoning chain templates with models like GPT-4o, and SFT Dataset Construction, pairing templates with benchmark datasets for supervised fine-tuning.Our experiments show that MoR significantly enhances performance, with MoR150 achieving 0.730 (2.2% improvement) using CoT prompting and 0.734 (13.5% improvement) compared to baselines. MoR eliminates the need for task-specific prompts, offering a generalizable solution for robust reasoning across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) provides a way to learn high-performance policies in environments where the reward signal is hard to specify, avoiding heuristic and time-consuming reward design. However, PbRL can suffer from slow convergence speed since it requires training in a reward model. Prior work has proposed learning a reward model from demonstrations and fine-tuning it using preferences. However, when the model is a neural network, using different loss functions for pre-training and fine-tuning can pose challenges to reliable optimization. In this paper, we propose a method to effectively leverage prior knowledge with a Residual Reward Model (RRM). An RRM assumes that the true reward of the environment can be split into a sum of two parts: a prior reward and a learned reward. The prior reward is a term available before training, for example, a user's ``best guess'' reward function, or a reward function learned from inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), and the learned reward is trained with preferences. We introduce state-based and image-based versions of RRM and evaluate them on several tasks in the Meta-World environment suite. Experimental results show that our method substantially improves the performance of a common PbRL method. Our method achieves performance improvements for a variety of different types of prior rewards, including proxy rewards, a reward obtained from IRL, and even a negated version of the proxy reward. We also conduct experiments with a Franka Panda to show that our method leads to superior performance on a real robot.

Abstract: Spin-lattice relaxation time ($T_1$) is an important biomarker in cardiac parametric mapping for characterizing myocardial tissue and diagnosing cardiomyopathies. Conventional Modified Look-Locker Inversion Recovery (MOLLI) acquires 11 breath-hold baseline images with interleaved rest periods to ensure mapping accuracy. However, prolonged scanning can be challenging for patients with poor breathholds, often leading to motion artifacts that degrade image quality. In addition, $T_1$ mapping requires voxel-wise nonlinear fitting to a signal recovery model involving an iterative estimation process. Recent studies have proposed deep-learning approaches for rapid $T_1$ mapping using shortened sequences to reduce acquisition time for patient comfort. Nevertheless, existing methods overlook important physics constraints, limiting interpretability and generalization. In this work, we present an accelerated, end-to-end $T_1$ mapping framework leveraging Physics-Informed Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to model temporal dynamics and address these challenges. Our method achieves high-accuracy $T_1$ estimation from a sparse subset of baseline images and ensures efficient null index estimation at test time. Specifically, we develop a continuous-time LSTM-ODE model to enable selective Look-Locker (LL) data acquisition with arbitrary time lags. Experimental results show superior performance in $T_1$ estimation for both native and post-contrast sequences and demonstrate the strong benefit of our physics-based formulation over direct data-driven $T_1$ priors.

Abstract: Correctness is an emergent property of systems where exposing error is cheaper than committing it. In dynamic, low-trust environments, autonomous AI agents benefit from delegating work to sub-agents, yet correctness cannot be assured through upfront specification or centralized oversight. We propose a protocol that enforces correctness through collateralized claims in a recursive verification game. Tasks are published as intents, and solvers compete to fulfill them. Selected solvers carry out tasks under risk, with correctness checked post hoc by verifiers. Any challenger can challenge a result by staking against it to trigger the verification process. Incorrect agents are slashed and correct opposition is rewarded, with an escalation path that penalizes erroneous verifiers themselves. When incentives are aligned across solvers, challengers, and verifiers, falsification conditions make correctness the Nash equilibrium.

<title>Cognitive Load-Aware Inference: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Optimizing the Token Economy of Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: The escalating computational costs of Large Language Model (LLM) inference have become a critical barrier to their widespread and sustainable deployment. While existing optimization strategies are effective, they are predominantly based on statistical heuristics or architectural modifications, lacking a guiding cognitive theory to manage the inference process itself. This paper aims to bridge this gap by introducing a novel paradigm: the Cognitive Load-Aware Inference (CLAI) framework, which operationalizes principles from Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) and neuroscience for LLM inference. We formalize the concepts of Intrinsic Cognitive Load, Extraneous Cognitive Load, and Germane Cognitive Load into quantifiable LLM metrics ($ICL_{LLM}$, $ECL_{LLM}$, and $GCL_{LLM}$), thereby reframing the inference process as a cognitive economics optimization problem: based on the intrinsic complexity of a problem ($ICL_{LLM}$), minimize wasteful computation ($ECL_{LLM}$), and strategically allocate the token budget to productive reasoning ($GCL_{LLM}$). We propose two implementation paths: CLAI-Prompt, a zero-shot method that guides a base LLM through cognitive control steps via a structured meta-prompt, and CLAI-Tune, a fine-tuned model that internalizes these principles for spontaneous cognitive economy. Across a range of benchmarks in complex reasoning, long-context question answering, and code generation, our methods achieve significant reductions in token consumption (up to 45\%) without sacrificing accuracy. Furthermore, CLAI-Tune exhibits an emergent ability to autonomously decompose difficult problems, a key characteristic of human expert cognition. This work demonstrates that by emulating the brain's resource management strategies, we can build more efficient, robust, and capable artificial intelligence systems.

<title>Generative Exaggeration in LLM Social Agents: Consistency, Bias, and Toxicity</title>

Abstract: We investigate how Large Language Models (LLMs) behave when simulating political discourse on social media. Leveraging 21 million interactions on X during the 2024 U.S. presidential election, we construct LLM agents based on 1,186 real users, prompting them to reply to politically salient tweets under controlled conditions. Agents are initialized either with minimal ideological cues (Zero Shot) or recent tweet history (Few Shot), allowing one-to-one comparisons with human replies. We evaluate three model families (Gemini, Mistral, and DeepSeek) across linguistic style, ideological consistency, and toxicity. We find that richer contextualization improves internal consistency but also amplifies polarization, stylized signals, and harmful language. We observe an emergent distortion that we call "generation exaggeration": a systematic amplification of salient traits beyond empirical baselines. Our analysis shows that LLMs do not emulate users, they reconstruct them. Their outputs, indeed, reflect internal optimization dynamics more than observed behavior, introducing structural biases that compromise their reliability as social proxies. This challenges their use in content moderation, deliberative simulations, and policy modeling.

<title>MTCNet: Motion and Topology Consistency Guided Learning for Mitral Valve Segmentationin 4D Ultrasound</title>

Abstract: Mitral regurgitation is one of the most prevalent cardiac disorders. Four-dimensional (4D) ultrasound has emerged as the primary imaging modality for assessing dynamic valvular morphology. However, 4D mitral valve (MV) analysis remains challenging due to limited phase annotations, severe motion artifacts, and poor imaging quality. Yet, the absence of inter-phase dependency in existing methods hinders 4D MV analysis. To bridge this gap, we propose a Motion-Topology guided consistency network (MTCNet) for accurate 4D MV ultrasound segmentation in semi-supervised learning (SSL). MTCNet requires only sparse end-diastolic and end-systolic annotations. First, we design a cross-phase motion-guided consistency learning strategy, utilizing a bi-directional attention memory bank to propagate spatio-temporal features. This enables MTCNet to achieve excellent performance both per- and inter-phase. Second, we devise a novel topology-guided correlation regularization that explores physical prior knowledge to maintain anatomically plausible. Therefore, MTCNet can effectively leverage structural correspondence between labeled and unlabeled phases. Extensive evaluations on the first largest 4D MV dataset, with 1408 phases from 160 patients, show that MTCNet performs superior cross-phase consistency compared to other advanced methods (Dice: 87.30%, HD: 1.75mm). Both the code and the dataset are available at https://github.com/crs524/MTCNet.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a key paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values, yet the reward models at its core remain largely opaque. In this work, we present sparse Autoencoder For Enhanced Reward model (\textbf{SAFER}), a novel framework for interpreting and improving reward models through mechanistic analysis. Leveraging Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), we uncover human-interpretable features in reward model activations, enabling insight into safety-relevant decision-making. We apply SAFER to safety-oriented preference datasets and quantify the salience of individual features by activation differences between chosen and rejected responses. Using these feature-level signals, we design targeted data poisoning and denoising strategies. Experiments show that SAFER can precisely degrade or enhance safety alignment with minimal data modification, without sacrificing general chat performance. Our approach contributes to interpreting, auditing and refining reward models in high-stakes LLM alignment tasks. Our codes are available at https://github.com/xzy-101/SAFER-code. \textit{This paper discusses topics related to large language model safety and may include discussions or examples that highlight potential risks or unsafe outcomes.}

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) involves localizing target objects in 3D point clouds based on natural language. While prior work has made strides using textual descriptions, leveraging spoken language-known as Audio-based 3D Visual Grounding-remains underexplored and challenging. Motivated by advances in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech representation learning, we propose Audio-3DVG, a simple yet effective framework that integrates audio and spatial information for enhanced grounding. Rather than treating speech as a monolithic input, we decompose the task into two complementary components. First, we introduce Object Mention Detection, a multi-label classification task that explicitly identifies which objects are referred to in the audio, enabling more structured audio-scene reasoning. Second, we propose an Audio-Guided Attention module that captures interactions between candidate objects and relational speech cues, improving target discrimination in cluttered scenes. To support benchmarking, we synthesize audio descriptions for standard 3DVG datasets, including ScanRefer, Sr3D, and Nr3D. Experimental results demonstrate that Audio-3DVG not only achieves new state-of-the-art performance in audio-based grounding, but also competes with text-based methods-highlighting the promise of integrating spoken language into 3D vision tasks.

Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning constructs a comprehensive road network by capturing the topological relationships between lane segments and their semantic types. This enables end-to-end autonomous driving systems to perform road-dependent maneuvers such as turning and lane changing. However, the limitations in consistent positional embedding and temporal multiple attribute learning in existing methods hinder accurate roadnet reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose TopoStreamer, an end-to-end temporal perception model for lane segment topology reasoning. Specifically, TopoStreamer introduces three key improvements: streaming attribute constraints, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding, and lane segment denoising. The streaming attribute constraints enforce temporal consistency in both centerline and boundary coordinates, along with their classifications. Meanwhile, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding enhances the learning of up-to-date positional information within queries, while lane segment denoising helps capture diverse lane segment patterns, ultimately improving model performance. Additionally, we assess the accuracy of existing models using a lane boundary classification metric, which serves as a crucial measure for lane-changing scenarios in autonomous driving. On the OpenLane-V2 dataset, TopoStreamer demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial performance gains of +3.4% mAP in lane segment perception and +2.1% OLS in centerline perception tasks.

Abstract: Large vision models achieve remarkable performance in various downstream tasks, primarily by personalizing pre-trained models through fine-tuning with private and valuable local data, which makes the personalized model a valuable intellectual property for its owner. Similar to the era of traditional DNNs, model stealing attacks also pose significant risks to these personalized models. However, in this paper, we reveal that most existing defense methods (developed for traditional DNNs), typically designed for models trained from scratch, either introduce additional security risks, are prone to misjudgment, or are even ineffective for fine-tuned models. To alleviate these problems, this paper proposes a harmless model ownership verification method for personalized models by decoupling similar common features. In general, our method consists of three main stages. In the first stage, we create shadow models that retain common features of the victim model while disrupting dataset-specific features. We represent the dataset-specific features of the victim model by the output differences between the shadow and victim models. After that, a meta-classifier is trained to identify stolen models by determining whether suspicious models contain the dataset-specific features of the victim. In the third stage, we conduct model ownership verification by hypothesis test to mitigate randomness and enhance robustness. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting different types of model stealing simultaneously.

Abstract: This paper presents a circuit-algorithm co-design framework for learnable analog front-end (AFE) in audio signal classification. Designing AFE and backend classifiers separately is a common practice but non-ideal, as shown in this paper. Instead, this paper proposes a joint optimization of the backend classifier with the AFE's transfer function to achieve system-level optimum. More specifically, the transfer function parameters of an analog bandpass filter (BPF) bank are tuned in a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-aware training loop for the classifier. Using a co-design loss function LBPF, this work shows superior optimization of both the filter bank and the classifier. Implemented in open-source SKY130 130nm CMOS process, the optimized design achieved 90.5%-94.2% accuracy for 10-keyword classification task across a wide range of input signal SNR from 5 dB to 20 dB, with only 22k classifier parameters. Compared to conventional approach, the proposed audio AFE achieves 8.7% and 12.9% reduction in power and capacitor area respectively.

Abstract: Evaluating creative writing generated by large language models (LLMs) remains challenging because open-ended narratives lack ground truths. Without performant automated evaluation methods, off-the-shelf (OTS) language models are employed as zero-shot judges, yet their reliability is unclear in this context. In pursuit of robust evaluation for creative writing, we introduce LitBench, the first standardized benchmark and paired dataset for creative writing verification, comprising a held-out test set of 2,480 debiased, human-labeled story comparisons drawn from Reddit and a 43,827-pair training corpus of human preference labels. Using LitBench, we (i) benchmark zero-shot LLM judges, (ii) train Bradley Terry and generative reward models, and (iii) conduct an online human study to validate reward model rankings on newly LLM-generated stories. Our benchmark identifies Claude-3.7-Sonnet as the strongest off-the-shelf judge, reaching 73% agreement with human preferences; among trained reward models, Bradley-Terry and Generative reward models both attain an accuracy of 78%, outperforming all off-the-shelf judges. An online human study further confirms that our trained reward models consistently align with human preferences in novel LLM-generated stories. We release LitBench and reward models at https://huggingface.co/collections/SAA-Lab/litbench-68267b5da3aafe58f9e43461, providing a vetted resource for reliable, automated evaluation and optimization of creative writing systems.

Abstract: [Context] AI assistants, like GitHub Copilot and Cursor, are transforming software engineering. While several studies highlight productivity improvements, their impact on maintainability requires further investigation. [Objective] This study investigates whether co-development with AI assistants affects software maintainability, specifically how easily other developers can evolve the resulting source code. [Method] We conducted a two-phase controlled experiment involving 151 participants, 95% of whom were professional developers. In Phase 1, participants added a new feature to a Java web application, with or without AI assistance. In Phase 2, a randomized controlled trial, new participants evolved these solutions without AI assistance. [Results] AI-assisted development in Phase 1 led to a modest speedup in subsequent evolution and slightly higher average CodeHealth. Although neither difference was significant overall, the increase in CodeHealth was statistically significant when habitual AI users completed Phase 1. For Phase 1, we also observed a significant effect that corroborates previous productivity findings: using an AI assistant yielded a 30.7% median decrease in task completion time. Moreover, for habitual AI users, the mean speedup was 55.9%. [Conclusions] Our study adds to the growing evidence that AI assistants can effectively accelerate development. Moreover, we did not observe warning signs of degraded code-level maintainability. We recommend that future research focus on risks such as code bloat from excessive code generation and the build-up of cognitive debt as developers invest less mental effort during implementation.

Abstract: Unified image restoration is a significantly challenging task in low-level vision. Existing methods either make tailored designs for specific tasks, limiting their generalizability across various types of degradation, or rely on training with paired datasets, thereby suffering from closed-set constraints. To address these issues, we propose a novel, dataset-free, and unified approach through recurrent posterior sampling utilizing a pretrained latent diffusion model. Our method incorporates the multimodal understanding model to provide sematic priors for the generative model under a task-blind condition. Furthermore, it utilizes a lightweight module to align the degraded input with the generated preference of the diffusion model, and employs recurrent refinement for posterior sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness and robustness. Our code and data will be available at https://github.com/AMAP-ML/LD-RPS.

Abstract: Moral judgment is integral to large language model (LLM) alignment and social reasoning. As multi-agent systems gain prominence, it becomes crucial to understand how LLMs function collectively during collaboration, compared to individual agents. In human moral judgment, group deliberation leads to a utilitarian boost: a tendency to endorse norm violations that maximize benefits for the greatest number of people despite harms. We study whether a similar dynamic emerges in multi-agent LLM systems. We tested six models on well-established sets of moral dilemmas across two conditions: (1) Solo, where models reasoned independently, and (2) Group, where they engaged in multi-turn discussions in pairs or triads. In personal moral dilemmas, where agents must decide to directly harm one individual to maximize the utility for others, all models found moral violations to be more acceptable when part of a group than individually, similar to human experiments. Some models endorsed actions that maximized overall well-being, even if they benefited strangers over familiar individuals. Others became more willing to violate moral norms in groups. However, while human groups show a similar action bias, the mechanism for their utilitarian boost differs from LLMs. Whereas the human shift comes from heightened sensitivity to decision outcomes, LLM groups show either reduced norm sensitivity or enhanced impartiality. This suggests that while the surface behavior of LLM collectives mimics human group reasoning, the underlying drivers differ. We discuss the implications for AI alignment, multi-agent design, and artificial moral reasoning.

Abstract: Accurate dynamics modeling is essential for quadrotors to achieve precise trajectory tracking in various applications. Traditional physical knowledge-driven modeling methods face substantial limitations in unknown environments characterized by variable payloads, wind disturbances, and external perturbations. On the other hand, data-driven modeling methods suffer from poor generalization when handling out-of-distribution (OoD) data, restricting their effectiveness in unknown scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce the Physics-Informed Wind-Adaptive Network (PI-WAN), which combines knowledge-driven and data-driven modeling methods by embedding physical constraints directly into the training process for robust quadrotor dynamics learning. Specifically, PI-WAN employs a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) architecture that efficiently captures temporal dependencies from historical flight data, while a physics-informed loss function applies physical principles to improve model generalization and robustness across previously unseen conditions. By incorporating real-time prediction results into a model predictive control (MPC) framework, we achieve improvements in closed-loop tracking performance. Comprehensive simulations and real-world flight experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline methods in terms of prediction accuracy, tracking precision, and robustness to unknown environments.

Abstract: Video Multimodal Large Language Models (V-MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in temporal reasoning and cross-modal understanding, yet their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains underexplored due to unique challenges: complex cross-modal reasoning mechanisms, temporal dependencies, and computational constraints. We present CAVALRY-V (Cross-modal Language-Vision Adversarial Yielding for Videos), a novel framework that directly targets the critical interface between visual perception and language generation in V-MLLMs. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) a dual-objective semantic-visual loss function that simultaneously disrupts the model's text generation logits and visual representations to undermine cross-modal integration, and (2) a computationally efficient two-stage generator framework that combines large-scale pre-training for cross-model transferability with specialized fine-tuning for spatiotemporal coherence. Empirical evaluation on comprehensive video understanding benchmarks demonstrates that CAVALRY-V significantly outperforms existing attack methods, achieving 22.8% average improvement over the best baseline attacks on both commercial systems (GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.0) and open-source models (QwenVL-2.5, InternVL-2.5, Llava-Video, Aria, MiniCPM-o-2.6). Our framework achieves flexibility through implicit temporal coherence modeling rather than explicit regularization, enabling significant performance improvements even on image understanding (34.4% average gain). This capability demonstrates CAVALRY-V's potential as a foundational approach for adversarial research across multimodal systems.

Abstract: Introduction: Deep learning (DL) models can help detect intracranial aneurysms on CTA, but high false positive (FP) rates remain a barrier to clinical translation, despite improvement in model architectures and strategies like detection threshold tuning. We employed an automated, anatomy-based, heuristic-learning hybrid artery-vein segmentation post-processing method to further reduce FPs. Methods: Two DL models, CPM-Net and a deformable 3D convolutional neural network-transformer hybrid (3D-CNN-TR), were trained with 1,186 open-source CTAs (1,373 annotated aneurysms), and evaluated with 143 held-out private CTAs (218 annotated aneurysms). Brain, artery, vein, and cavernous venous sinus (CVS) segmentation masks were applied to remove possible FPs in the DL outputs that overlapped with: (1) brain mask; (2) vein mask; (3) vein more than artery masks; (4) brain plus vein mask; (5) brain plus vein more than artery masks. Results: CPM-Net yielded 139 true-positives (TP); 79 false-negative (FN); 126 FP. 3D-CNN-TR yielded 179 TP; 39 FN; 182 FP. FPs were commonly extracranial (CPM-Net 27.3%; 3D-CNN-TR 42.3%), venous (CPM-Net 56.3%; 3D-CNN-TR 29.1%), arterial (CPM-Net 11.9%; 3D-CNN-TR 53.3%), and non-vascular (CPM-Net 25.4%; 3D-CNN-TR 9.3%) structures. Method 5 performed best, reducing CPM-Net FP by 70.6% (89/126) and 3D-CNN-TR FP by 51.6% (94/182), without reducing TP, lowering the FP/case rate from 0.88 to 0.26 for CPM-NET, and from 1.27 to 0.62 for the 3D-CNN-TR. Conclusion: Anatomy-based, interpretable post-processing can improve DL-based aneurysm detection model performance. More broadly, automated, domain-informed, hybrid heuristic-learning processing holds promise for improving the performance and clinical acceptance of aneurysm detection models.

Abstract: For robotic manipulation, existing robotics datasets and simulation benchmarks predominantly cater to robot-arm platforms. However, for humanoid robots equipped with dual arms and dexterous hands, simulation tasks and high-quality demonstrations are notably lacking. Bimanual dexterous manipulation is inherently more complex, as it requires coordinated arm movements and hand operations, making autonomous data collection challenging. This paper presents HumanoidGen, an automated task creation and demonstration collection framework that leverages atomic dexterous operations and LLM reasoning to generate relational constraints. Specifically, we provide spatial annotations for both assets and dexterous hands based on the atomic operations, and perform an LLM planner to generate a chain of actionable spatial constraints for arm movements based on object affordances and scenes. To further improve planning ability, we employ a variant of Monte Carlo tree search to enhance LLM reasoning for long-horizon tasks and insufficient annotation. In experiments, we create a novel benchmark with augmented scenarios to evaluate the quality of the collected data. The results show that the performance of the 2D and 3D diffusion policies can scale with the generated dataset. Project page is https://openhumanoidgen.github.io.

<title>Stylometry recognizes human and LLM-generated texts in short samples</title>

Abstract: The paper explores stylometry as a method to distinguish between texts created by Large Language Models (LLMs) and humans, addressing issues of model attribution, intellectual property, and ethical AI use. Stylometry has been used extensively to characterise the style and attribute authorship of texts. By applying it to LLM-generated texts, we identify their emergent writing patterns. The paper involves creating a benchmark dataset based on Wikipedia, with (a) human-written term summaries, (b) texts generated purely by LLMs (GPT-3.5/4, LLaMa 2/3, Orca, and Falcon), (c) processed through multiple text summarisation methods (T5, BART, Gensim, and Sumy), and (d) rephrasing methods (Dipper, T5). The 10-sentence long texts were classified by tree-based models (decision trees and LightGBM) using human-designed (StyloMetrix) and n-gram-based (our own pipeline) stylometric features that encode lexical, grammatical, syntactic, and punctuation patterns. The cross-validated results reached a performance of up to .87 Matthews correlation coefficient in the multiclass scenario with 7 classes, and accuracy between .79 and 1. in binary classification, with the particular example of Wikipedia and GPT-4 reaching up to .98 accuracy on a balanced dataset. Shapley Additive Explanations pinpointed features characteristic of the encyclopaedic text type, individual overused words, as well as a greater grammatical standardisation of LLMs with respect to human-written texts. These results show -- crucially, in the context of the increasingly sophisticated LLMs -- that it is possible to distinguish machine- from human-generated texts at least for a well-defined text type.

Abstract: The growing use of deep learning necessitates efficient network design and deployment, making neural predictors vital for estimating attributes such as accuracy and latency. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and transformers have shown promising performance in representing neural architectures. However, each of both methods has its disadvantages. GNNs lack the capabilities to represent complicated features, while transformers face poor generalization when the depth of architecture grows. To mitigate the above issues, we rethink neural architecture topology and show that sibling nodes are pivotal while overlooked in previous research. We thus propose a novel predictor leveraging the strengths of GNNs and transformers to learn the enhanced topology. We introduce a novel token mixer that considers siblings, and a new channel mixer named bidirectional graph isomorphism feed-forward network. Our approach consistently achieves promising performance in both accuracy and latency prediction, providing valuable insights for learning Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) topology. The code is available at https://github.com/XuRuihan/NNFormer.

Abstract: Memes are widely used in online social interactions, providing vivid, intuitive, and often humorous means to express intentions and emotions. Existing dialogue datasets are predominantly limited to either manually annotated or pure-text conversations, lacking the expressiveness and contextual nuance that multimodal interactions provide.To address these challenges, we introduce MemeCMD, an automatically generated Chinese Multi-turn Dialogue dataset with contextually retrieved memes. Our dataset combines a large-scale, MLLM-annotated meme library with dialogues auto-generated by dual agents across diverse scenarios. We introduce a retrieval framework and adaptive threshold to ensure contextually relevant, naturally spaced meme usage. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating contextually appropriate and diverse meme-incorporated dialogues, offering a scalable and privacy-preserving resource for advancing multimodal conversational AI.

<title>Constellation as a Service: Tailored Connectivity Management in Direct-Satellite-to-Device Networks</title>

Abstract: Direct-satellite-to-device (DS2D) communication is emerging as a promising solution for global mobile service extension, leveraging the deployment of satellite constellations. However, the challenge of managing DS2D connectivity for multi-constellations becomes outstanding, including high interference and frequent handovers caused by multi-coverage overlap and rapid satellite movement. Moreover, existing approaches primarily operate within single-constellation shell, which inherently limits the ability to exploit the vast potential of multi-constellation connectivity provision, resulting in suboptimal DS2D service performances. To address these challenges, this article proposes a Constellation as a Service (CaaS) framework, which treats the entire multi-constellation infrastructure as a shared resource pool and dynamically forms optimal sub-constellations (SCs) for each DS2D service region. The formation of each SC integrates satellites from various orbits to provide tailored connectivity based on user demands, guided by two innovative strategies: predictive satellite beamforming using generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and pre-configured handover path for efficient satellite access and mobility management. Simulation results demonstrate that CaaS significantly improves satellite service rates while reducing handover overhead, making it an efficient and continuable solution for managing DS2D connectivity in multi-constellation environments.

Abstract: Objectives Parametric tissue mapping enables quantitative cardiac tissue characterization but is limited by inter-observer variability during manual delineation. Traditional approaches relying on average relaxation values and single cutoffs may oversimplify myocardial complexity. This study evaluates whether deep learning (DL) can achieve segmentation accuracy comparable to inter-observer variability, explores the utility of statistical features beyond mean T1/T2 values, and assesses whether machine learning (ML) combining multiple features enhances disease detection. Materials & Methods T1 and T2 maps were manually segmented. The test subset was independently annotated by two observers, and inter-observer variability was assessed. A DL model was trained to segment left ventricle blood pool and myocardium. Average (A), lower quartile (LQ), median (M), and upper quartile (UQ) were computed for the myocardial pixels and employed in classification by applying cutoffs or in ML. Dice similarity coefficient (DICE) and mean absolute percentage error evaluated segmentation performance. Bland-Altman plots assessed inter-user and model-observer agreement. Receiver operating characteristic analysis determined optimal cutoffs. Pearson correlation compared features from model and manual segmentations. F1-score, precision, and recall evaluated classification performance. Wilcoxon test assessed differences between classification methods, with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Results 144 subjects were split into training (100), validation (15) and evaluation (29) subsets. Segmentation model achieved a DICE of 85.4%, surpassing inter-observer agreement. Random forest applied to all features increased F1-score (92.7%, p < 0.001). Conclusion DL facilitates segmentation of T1/ T2 maps. Combining multiple features with ML improves disease detection.

Abstract: In a world where deepfakes and cloned voices are emerging as sophisticated attack vectors, organizations require a new security mindset: Sensorial Zero Trust [9]. This article presents a scientific analysis of the need to systematically doubt information perceived through the senses, establishing rigorous verification protocols to mitigate the risks of fraud based on generative artificial intelligence. Key concepts, such as Out-of-Band verification, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as forensic collaborators, cryptographic provenance, and human training, are integrated into a framework that extends Zero Trust principles to human sensory information. The approach is grounded in empirical findings and academic research, emphasizing that in an era of AI-generated realities, even our eyes and ears can no longer be implicitly trusted without verification. Leaders are called to foster a culture of methodological skepticism to protect organizational integrity in this new threat landscape.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is fueling exponential electricity demand growth, threatening grid reliability, raising prices for communities paying for new energy infrastructure, and stunting AI innovation as data centers wait for interconnection to constrained grids. This paper presents the first field demonstration, in collaboration with major corporate partners, of a software-only approach--Emerald Conductor--that transforms AI data centers into flexible grid resources that can efficiently and immediately harness existing power systems without massive infrastructure buildout. Conducted at a 256-GPU cluster running representative AI workloads within a commercial, hyperscale cloud data center in Phoenix, Arizona, the trial achieved a 25% reduction in cluster power usage for three hours during peak grid events while maintaining AI quality of service (QoS) guarantees. By orchestrating AI workloads based on real-time grid signals without hardware modifications or energy storage, this platform reimagines data centers as grid-interactive assets that enhance grid reliability, advance affordability, and accelerate AI's development.

Abstract: The long-standing vision of intelligent cities is to create efficient, livable, and sustainable urban environments using big data and artificial intelligence technologies. Recently, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new ways toward realizing this vision. With powerful semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities, LLMs can be deployed as intelligent agents capable of autonomously solving complex problems across domains. In this article, we focus on Urban LLM Agents, which are LLM-powered agents that are semi-embodied within the hybrid cyber-physical-social space of cities and used for system-level urban decision-making. First, we introduce the concept of urban LLM agents, discussing their unique capabilities and features. Second, we survey the current research landscape from the perspective of agent workflows, encompassing urban sensing, memory management, reasoning, execution, and learning. Third, we categorize the application domains of urban LLM agents into five groups: urban planning, transportation, environment, public safety, and urban society, presenting representative works in each group. Finally, we discuss trustworthiness and evaluation issues that are critical for real-world deployment, and identify several open problems for future research. This survey aims to establish a foundation for the emerging field of urban LLM agents and to provide a roadmap for advancing the intersection of LLMs and urban intelligence. A curated list of relevant papers and open-source resources is maintained and continuously updated at https://github.com/usail-hkust/Awesome-Urban-LLM-Agents.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled the development of autonomous web agents capable of navigating and interacting with real websites. However, evaluating such agents remains challenging due to the instability and inconsistency of existing benchmarks, which often rely on dynamic content or oversimplified simulations. In this work, we introduce WebArXiv, a static and time-invariant benchmark comprising 275 web-based tasks grounded in the arXiv platform. WebArXiv ensures reproducible and reliable evaluation by anchoring tasks in fixed web snapshots with deterministic ground truths and standardized action trajectories. Through behavioral analysis, we identify a common failure mode, Rigid History Reflection, where agents over-rely on fixed interaction histories. To address this, we propose a lightweight dynamic reflection mechanism that allows agents to selectively retrieve relevant past steps during decision-making. We evaluate ten state-of-the-art web agents on WebArXiv. Results demonstrate clear performance differences across agents and validate the effectiveness of our proposed reflection strategy.

Abstract: The paradigm of large language models in natural language processing (NLP) has also shown promise in modeling biological languages, including proteins, RNA, and DNA. Both the auto-regressive generation paradigm and evaluation metrics have been transferred from NLP to biological sequence modeling. However, the intrinsic structural correlations in natural and biological languages differ fundamentally. Therefore, we revisit the notion of language in biological systems to better understand how NLP successes can be effectively translated to biological domains. By treating the 3D structure of biomolecules as the semantic content of a sentence and accounting for the strong correlations between residues or bases, we highlight the importance of structural evaluation and demonstrate the applicability of the auto-regressive paradigm in biological language modeling.

<title>MambAttention: Mamba with Multi-Head Attention for Generalizable Single-Channel Speech Enhancement</title>

Abstract: With the advent of new sequence models like Mamba and xLSTM, several studies have shown that these models match or outperform state-of-the-art models in single-channel speech enhancement, automatic speech recognition, and self-supervised audio representation learning. However, prior research has demonstrated that sequence models like LSTM and Mamba tend to overfit to the training set. To address this issue, previous works have shown that adding self-attention to LSTMs substantially improves generalization performance for single-channel speech enhancement. Nevertheless, neither the concept of hybrid Mamba and time-frequency attention models nor their generalization performance have been explored for speech enhancement. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid architecture, MambAttention, which combines Mamba and shared time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalizable single-channel speech enhancement. To train our model, we introduce VoiceBank+Demand Extended (VB-DemandEx), a dataset inspired by VoiceBank+Demand but with more challenging noise types and lower signal-to-noise ratios. Trained on VB-DemandEx, our proposed MambAttention model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art LSTM-, xLSTM-, Mamba-, and Conformer-based systems of similar complexity across all reported metrics on two out-of-domain datasets: DNS 2020 and EARS-WHAM_v2, while matching their performance on the in-domain dataset VB-DemandEx. Ablation studies highlight the role of weight sharing between the time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalization performance. Finally, we explore integrating the shared time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules with LSTM and xLSTM, which yields a notable performance improvement on the out-of-domain datasets. However, our MambAttention model remains superior on both out-of-domain datasets across all reported evaluation metrics.

<title>Surgical Neural Radiance Fields from One Image</title>

<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00969</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.00969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) offer exceptional capabilities for 3D reconstruction and view synthesis, yet their reliance on extensive multi-view data limits their application in surgical intraoperative settings where only limited data is available. In particular, collecting such extensive data intraoperatively is impractical due to time constraints. This work addresses this challenge by leveraging a single intraoperative image and preoperative data to train NeRF efficiently for surgical scenarios.
  Methods: We leverage preoperative MRI data to define the set of camera viewpoints and images needed for robust and unobstructed training. Intraoperatively, the appearance of the surgical image is transferred to the pre-constructed training set through neural style transfer, specifically combining WTC2 and STROTSS to prevent over-stylization. This process enables the creation of a dataset for instant and fast single-image NeRF training.
  Results: The method is evaluated with four clinical neurosurgical cases. Quantitative comparisons to NeRF models trained on real surgical microscope images demonstrate strong synthesis agreement, with similarity metrics indicating high reconstruction fidelity and stylistic alignment. When compared with ground truth, our method demonstrates high structural similarity, confirming good reconstruction quality and texture preservation.
  Conclusion: Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of single-image NeRF training in surgical settings, overcoming the limitations of traditional multi-view methods.

Abstract: Reasoning methods that adaptively allocate test-time compute have advanced LLM performance on easy to verify domains such as math and code. In this work, we study how to utilize this approach to train models that exhibit a degree of robustness to safety vulnerabilities, and show that doing so can provide benefits. We build a recipe called $\textit{TARS}$ (Training Adaptive Reasoners for Safety), a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that trains models to reason about safety using chain-of-thought traces and a reward signal that balances safety with task completion. To build TARS, we identify three critical design choices: (1) a "lightweight" warmstart SFT stage, (2) a mix of harmful, harmless, and ambiguous prompts to prevent shortcut behaviors such as too many refusals, and (3) a reward function to prevent degeneration of reasoning capabilities during training. Models trained with TARS exhibit adaptive behaviors by spending more compute on ambiguous queries, leading to better safety-refusal trade-offs. They also internally learn to better distinguish between safe and unsafe prompts and attain greater robustness to both white-box (e.g., GCG) and black-box attacks (e.g., PAIR). Overall, our work provides an effective, open recipe for training LLMs against jailbreaks and harmful requests by reasoning per prompt.

Abstract: This work introduces Robots Imitating Generated Videos (RIGVid), a system that enables robots to perform complex manipulation tasks--such as pouring, wiping, and mixing--purely by imitating AI-generated videos, without requiring any physical demonstrations or robot-specific training. Given a language command and an initial scene image, a video diffusion model generates potential demonstration videos, and a vision-language model (VLM) automatically filters out results that do not follow the command. A 6D pose tracker then extracts object trajectories from the video, and the trajectories are retargeted to the robot in an embodiment-agnostic fashion. Through extensive real-world evaluations, we show that filtered generated videos are as effective as real demonstrations, and that performance improves with generation quality. We also show that relying on generated videos outperforms more compact alternatives such as keypoint prediction using VLMs, and that strong 6D pose tracking outperforms other ways to extract trajectories, such as dense feature point tracking. These findings suggest that videos produced by a state-of-the-art off-the-shelf model can offer an effective source of supervision for robotic manipulation.

Abstract: We present SciArena, an open and collaborative platform for evaluating foundation models on scientific literature tasks. Unlike traditional benchmarks for scientific literature understanding and synthesis, SciArena engages the research community directly, following the Chatbot Arena evaluation approach of community voting on model comparisons. By leveraging collective intelligence, SciArena offers a community-driven evaluation of model performance on open-ended scientific tasks that demand literature-grounded, long-form responses. The platform currently supports 23 open-source and proprietary foundation models and has collected over 13,000 votes from trusted researchers across diverse scientific domains. We analyze the data collected so far and confirm that the submitted questions are diverse, aligned with real-world literature needs, and that participating researchers demonstrate strong self-consistency and inter-annotator agreement in their evaluations. We discuss the results and insights based on the model ranking leaderboard. To further promote research in building model-based automated evaluation systems for literature tasks, we release SciArena-Eval, a meta-evaluation benchmark based on our collected preference data. The benchmark measures the accuracy of models in judging answer quality by comparing their pairwise assessments with human votes. Our experiments highlight the benchmark's challenges and emphasize the need for more reliable automated evaluation methods.

Abstract: Recent studies have proposed interpreting the training process from an ergodic perspective. Building on this foundation we present a unified framework for understanding and accelerating the training of deep neural networks via stochastic gradient descent. By analyzing the geometric landscape of the objective function we introduce a practical diagnostic, the running estimate of the largest Lyapunov exponent, which provably distinguishes genuine convergence toward stable minimizers from mere statistical stabilization near saddle points. We then propose a ghost category extension for standard classifiers that adds auxiliary ghost output nodes so the model gains extra descent directions that open a lateral corridor around narrow loss barriers and enable the optimizer to bypass poor basins during the early training phase. We show that this extension strictly reduces approximation error and that after sufficient convergence the ghost dimensions collapse and the extended model's invariant law coincides with that of the original and there exists a path in the enlarged parameter space along which the total loss does not increase while the original loss decreases by an arbitrary margin. Taken together these results provide a principled architecture level intervention that accelerates early stage trainability while preserving asymptotic behavior.

Abstract: We present GLM-4.1V-Thinking, a vision-language model (VLM) designed to advance general-purpose multimodal reasoning. In this report, we share our key findings in the development of the reasoning-centric training framework. We first develop a capable vision foundation model with significant potential through large-scale pre-training, which arguably sets the upper bound for the final performance. Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Sampling (RLCS) then unlocks the full potential of the model, leading to comprehensive capability enhancement across a diverse range of tasks, including STEM problem solving, video understanding, content recognition, coding, grounding, GUI-based agents, and long document understanding, among others. To facilitate research in this field, we open-source GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking, which achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of comparable size. In a comprehensive evaluation across 28 public benchmarks, our model outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B on nearly all tasks and achieves comparable or even superior performance on 18 benchmarks relative to the significantly larger Qwen2.5-VL-72B. Notably, GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking also demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to closed-source models such as GPT-4o on challenging tasks including long document understanding and STEM reasoning, further underscoring its strong capabilities. Code, models and more information are released at https://github.com/THUDM/GLM-4.1V-Thinking.

Abstract: Environmental disturbances, such as sensor data noises, various lighting conditions, challenging weathers and external adversarial perturbations, are inevitable in real self-driving applications. Existing researches and testings have shown that they can severely influence the vehicles perception ability and performance, one of the main issue is the false positive detection, i.e., the ghost object which is not real existed or occurs in the wrong position (such as a non-existent vehicle). Traditional navigation methods tend to avoid every detected objects for safety, however, avoiding a ghost object may lead the vehicle into a even more dangerous situation, such as a sudden break on the highway. Considering the various disturbance types, it is difficult to address this issue at the perceptual aspect. A potential solution is to detect the ghost through relation learning among the whole scenario and develop an integrated end-to-end navigation system. Our underlying logic is that the behavior of all vehicles in the scene is influenced by their neighbors, and normal vehicles behave in a logical way, while ghost vehicles do not. By learning the spatio-temporal relation among surrounding vehicles, an information reliability representation is learned for each detected vehicle and then a robot navigation network is developed. In contrast to existing works, we encourage the network to learn how to represent the reliability and how to aggregate all the information with uncertainties by itself, thus increasing the efficiency and generalizability. To the best of the authors knowledge, this paper provides the first work on using graph relation learning to achieve end-to-end robust navigation in the presence of ghost vehicles. Simulation results in the CARLA platform demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method in various scenarios.

However, their performance in specific downstream tasks is usually hindered by their knowledge boundaries on these tasks. Thus, fine-tuning techniques, especially the widely used Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method, have been introduced to expand the boundaries on these tasks, whereas LoRA would underperform on certain tasks owing to its potential overfitting on these tasks. To overcome this overfitting and improve the performance of LoRA, we propose the flexible low rank adaptation (Flexora) method to automatically and flexibly select the most important layers needing to be fine-tuned to achieve the best performance on different downstream tasks. Specifically, Flexora firstly frames this layer selection problem as a well-defined hyperparameter optimization (HPO) problem, then addresses it using the unrolled differentiation (UD) method, and finally selects the most useful layers based on the optimized hyperparameters. Our extensive experiments on many pretrained models and natural language tasks show that Flexora is able to consistently improve over the existing baselines, indicating the effectiveness of our Flexora in practice. We additionally provide insightful theoretical results and many ablation studies to deliver a comprehensive understanding of our Flexora.

Abstract: Due to the dynamic nature of the Semantic Web, version control is necessary to capture time-varying information, particularly for widely used ontologies. Despite the long-standing recognition of ontology versioning (OV) as a crucial component for efficient ontology management, the growing size of ontologies and accumulating errors caused by manual labour overwhelm current OV approaches. In this paper, we propose a fresh approach to performing OV using existing ontology matching (OM) techniques and systems. We introduce a unified OM4OV pipeline. From an OM perspective, we reconstruct a new task formulation and measurements for OV tasks. Building upon the prior alignment(s) from OM, we propose a pipeline optimisation method called the cross-reference (CR) mechanism to enhance overall OV performance. We experimentally validate the OM4OV pipeline and the cross-reference mechanism in an OV testbed originating from the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) datasets. We also discuss insights into OM used for OV tasks, where some apparent false mappings detected by OV systems are not actually untrue.

Abstract: Generative AI systems have revolutionized human interaction by enabling natural language-based coding and problem solving. However, the inherent ambiguity of natural language often leads to imprecise instructions, forcing users to iteratively test, correct, and resubmit their prompts. We propose an iterative approach that systematically narrows down these ambiguities through a structured series of clarification questions and alternative solution proposals, illustrated with input/output examples as well. Once every uncertainty is resolved, a final, precise solution is generated. Evaluated on a diverse dataset spanning coding, data analysis, and creative writing, our method demonstrates superior accuracy, competitive resolution times, and higher user satisfaction compared to conventional one-shot solutions, which typically require multiple manual iterations to achieve a correct output.

Abstract: Limitations in Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities for hardware design tasks, such as generating functional Verilog codes, have motivated various fine-tuning optimizations utilizing curated hardware datasets from open-source repositories. However, these datasets remain limited in size and contain minimal checks on licensing for reuse, resulting in potential copyright violations by fine-tuned LLMs. Therefore, we propose an evaluation benchmark to estimate the risk of Verilog-trained LLMs to generate copyright-protected codes. To minimize this risk, we present an open-source Verilog dataset, FreeSet, containing over 220k files, along with the automated dataset curation framework utilized to provide additional guarantees of fair-use Verilog data. We then execute an LLM fine-tuning framework consisting of continual pre-training, resulting in a fine-tuned Llama model for Verilog, FreeV. Our results indicate that FreeV demonstrates the smallest risk of copyright-infringement among prior works, with only a 3% violation rate. Furthermore, experimental results demonstrate improvements in Verilog generation functionality over its baseline model, improving VerilogEval pass@10 rates by over 10%.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled unified processing of language, vision, and structured inputs, opening the door to complex tasks such as logical deduction, spatial reasoning, and scientific analysis. Despite their promise, the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, particularly those augmented with intermediate thinking traces (MLLMs-T), remain poorly understood and lack standardized evaluation benchmarks. Existing work focuses primarily on perception or final answer correctness, offering limited insight into how models reason or fail across modalities. To address this gap, we introduce the MMMR, a new benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate multi-modal reasoning with explicit thinking. The MMMR comprises 1) a high-difficulty dataset of 1,083 questions spanning six diverse reasoning types with symbolic depth and multi-hop demands and 2) a modular Reasoning Trace Evaluation Pipeline (RTEP) for assessing reasoning quality beyond accuracy through metrics like relevance, consistency, and structured error annotations. Empirical results show that MLLMs-T overall outperform non-thinking counterparts, but even top models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet and Gemini-2.5 Pro suffer from reasoning pathologies such as inconsistency and overthinking. This benchmark reveals persistent gaps between accuracy and reasoning quality and provides an actionable evaluation pipeline for future model development. Overall, the MMMR offers a scalable foundation for evaluating, comparing, and improving the next generation of multi-modal reasoning systems.

Abstract: Can a scientific simulation system be physically consistent, interpretable by design, and scalable across regimes--all at once? Despite decades of progress, this trifecta remains elusive. Classical methods like Kinetic Monte Carlo ensure thermodynamic accuracy but scale poorly; learning-based methods offer efficiency but often sacrifice physical consistency and interpretability. We present SwarmThinkers, a reinforcement learning framework that recasts atomic-scale simulation as a physically grounded swarm intelligence system. Each diffusing particle is modeled as a local decision-making agent that selects transitions via a shared policy network trained under thermodynamic constraints. A reweighting mechanism fuses learned preferences with transition rates, preserving statistical fidelity while enabling interpretable, step-wise decision making. Training follows a centralized-training, decentralized-execution paradigm, allowing the policy to generalize across system sizes, concentrations, and temperatures without retraining. On a benchmark simulating radiation-induced Fe-Cu alloy precipitation, SwarmThinkers is the first system to achieve full-scale, physically consistent simulation on a single A100 GPU, previously attainable only via OpenKMC on a supercomputer. It delivers up to 4963x (3185x on average) faster computation with 485x lower memory usage. By treating particles as decision-makers, not passive samplers, SwarmThinkers marks a paradigm shift in scientific simulation--one that unifies physical consistency, interpretability, and scalability through agent-driven intelligence.

Abstract: Solving algebraic word problems (AWPs) has recently emerged as an important natural language processing task. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful mathematical capabilities, and the Chain-of-Thought technique, which guides LLMs through step-by-step reasoning, has yielded impressive results. However, this reasoning ability is limited by the computational weaknesses of LLMs themselves, where calculation errors can accumulate, leading to incorrect final answers. To address this, we propose Program of Equations Thoughts (POET), which transforms the task of generating step-by-step reasoning answers into a two-stage task of predicting equations and generating code, offloading complex computations to a Python interpreter to avoid calculation errors in LLMs. Furthermore, we propose Zero-shot POET, which utilizes a manually designed template to enable LLMs to directly generate Python code for one-step solving. Our method achieves accuracies of 95.3% and 98.0% on the PEN and ALG514 datasets, respectively, setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA). Zero-shot POET also achieves the SOTA result of 95.5% on the DRAW-1K dataset.

Abstract: Formal/symbolic semantics can provide canonical, rigid controllability and interpretability to sentence representations due to their \textit{localisation} or \textit{composition} property. How can we deliver such property to the current distributional sentence representations to control and interpret the generation of language models (LMs)? In this work, we theoretically frame the sentence semantics as the composition of \textit{semantic role - word content} features and propose the formal semantic geometry. To inject such geometry into Transformer-based LMs (i.e. GPT2), we deploy Transformer-based Variational AutoEncoder with a supervision approach, where the sentence generation can be manipulated and explained over low-dimensional latent Gaussian space. In addition, we propose a new probing algorithm to guide the movement of sentence vectors over such geometry. Experimental results reveal that the formal semantic geometry can potentially deliver better control and interpretation to sentence generation.

Abstract: As Diffusion Models have shown promising performance, a lot of efforts have been made to improve the controllability of Diffusion Models. However, how to train Diffusion Models to have the disentangled latent spaces and how to naturally incorporate the disentangled conditions during the sampling process have been underexplored. In this paper, we present a training framework for feature disentanglement of Diffusion Models (FDiff). We further propose two sampling methods that can boost the realism of our Diffusion Models and also enhance the controllability. Concisely, we train Diffusion Models conditioned on two latent features, a spatial content mask, and a flattened style embedding. We rely on the inductive bias of the denoising process of Diffusion Models to encode pose/layout information in the content feature and semantic/style information in the style feature. Regarding the sampling methods, we first generalize Composable Diffusion Models (GCDM) by breaking the conditional independence assumption to allow for some dependence between conditional inputs, which is shown to be effective in realistic generation in our experiments. Second, we propose timestep-dependent weight scheduling for content and style features to further improve the performance. We also observe better controllability of our proposed methods compared to existing methods in image manipulation and image translation.

<title>Junk DNA Hypothesis: Pruning Small Pre-Trained Weights Irreversibly and Monotonically Impairs "Difficult" Downstream Tasks in LLMs</title>

Abstract: We present Junk DNA Hypothesis by adopting a novel task-centric angle for the pre-trained weights of large language models (LLMs). It has been believed that weights in LLMs contain significant redundancy, leading to the conception that a considerable chunk of the parameters can be removed by pruning without compromising performance. Contrary to this belief, this paper presents a counter-argument: small-magnitude weights of pre-trained model weights encode vital knowledge essential for tackling difficult downstream tasks - manifested as the monotonic relationship between the performance drop of downstream tasks across the difficulty spectrum, as we prune more pre-trained weights by magnitude. Moreover, we reveal that these seemingly inconsequential weights can result in irreparable loss of knowledge and performance degradation in difficult tasks, even when downstream continual training is allowed. Interestingly, our evaluations show that the other popular compression, namely quantization, fails to exhibit similar monotonic effect and does not as convincingly disentangle this task-difficulty information. To study formally, we introduce several quantifiable metrics to gauge the downstream task difficulty: (1) within the same task category, and (2) across different task categories. Our extensive experiments substantiate the Junk DNA Hypothesis across a diverse range of model sizes, tasks, datasets, and even pruning methods.

<title>Identifying the Truth of Global Model: A Generic Solution to Defend Against Byzantine and Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning (full version)</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple parties to train machine learning models collaboratively without sharing the raw training data. However, the federated nature of FL enables malicious clients to influence a trained model by injecting error model updates via Byzantine or backdoor attacks. To detect malicious model updates, a typical approach is to measure the distance between each model update and a \textit{ground-truth model update}. To find such \textit{ground-truth model updates}, existing defenses either require a benign root dataset on the server (e.g., FLTrust) or simply use trimmed mean or median as the threshold for clipping (e.g., FLAME). However, such benign root datasets are impractical, and the trimmed mean or median may also eliminate contributions from these underrepresented datasets.
  In this paper, we propose a generic solution, namely FedTruth, to defend against model poisoning attacks in FL, where the \textit{ground-truth model update} (i.e., the global model update) will be estimated among all the model updates with dynamic aggregation weights. Specifically, FedTruth does not have specific assumptions on the benign or malicious data distribution or access to a benign root dataset. Moreover, FedTruth considers the potential contributions from all benign clients. Our empirical results show that FedTruth can reduce the impacts of poisoned model updates against both Byzantine and backdoor attacks, and is also efficient in large-scale FL systems.

<title>Realism in Action: Anomaly-Aware Diagnosis of Brain Tumors from Medical Images Using YOLOv8 and DeiT</title>

Abstract: Reliable diagnosis of brain tumors remains challenging due to low clinical incidence rates of such cases. However, this low rate is neglected in most of proposed methods. We propose a clinically inspired framework for anomaly-resilient tumor detection and classification. Detection leverages YOLOv8n fine-tuned on a realistically imbalanced dataset (1:9 tumor-to-normal ratio; 30,000 MRI slices from 81 patients). In addition, we propose a novel Patient-to-Patient (PTP) metric that evaluates diagnostic reliability at the patient level. Classification employs knowledge distillation: a Data Efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) student model is distilled from a ResNet152 teacher. The distilled ViT achieves an F1-score of 0.92 within 20 epochs, matching near teacher performance (F1=0.97) with significantly reduced computational resources. This end-to-end framework demonstrates high robustness in clinically representative anomaly-distributed data, offering a viable tool that adheres to realistic situations in clinics.

Abstract: We build on the theory of ontology logs (ologs) created by Spivak and Kent, and define a notion of wiring diagrams. In this article, a wiring diagram is a finite directed labelled graph. The labels correspond to types in an olog; they can also be interpreted as readings of sensors in an autonomous system. As such, wiring diagrams can be used as a framework for an autonomous system to form abstract concepts. We show that the graphs underlying skeleton wiring diagrams form a category. This allows skeleton wiring diagrams to be compared and manipulated using techniques from both graph theory and category theory. We also extend the usual definition of graph edit distance to the case of wiring diagrams by using operations only available to wiring diagrams, leading to a metric on the set of all skeleton wiring diagrams. In the end, we give an extended example on calculating the distance between two concepts represented by wiring diagrams, and explain how to apply our framework to any application domain.

Abstract: This paper presents a convolutional neural network model for precipitation nowcasting that combines data-driven learning with physics-informed domain knowledge. We propose LUPIN, a Lagrangian Double U-Net for Physics-Informed Nowcasting, that draws from existing extrapolation-based nowcasting methods. It consists of a U-Net that dynamically produces mesoscale advection motion fields, a differentiable semi-Lagrangian extrapolation operator, and an advection-free U-Net capturing the growth and decay of precipitation over time. Using our approach, we successfully implement the Lagrangian convolutional neural network for precipitation nowcasting in a fully differentiable and GPU-accelerated manner. This allows for end-to-end training and inference, including the data-driven Lagrangian coordinate system transformation of the data at runtime. We evaluate the model and compare it with other related AI-based models both quantitatively and qualitatively in an extreme event case study. Based on our evaluation, LUPIN matches and even exceeds the performance of the chosen benchmarks, opening the door for other Lagrangian machine learning models.

Real-time benchmarks on an NVIDIA RTX 3060 show a constant Average Imaging Time (54 to 84 ms) regardless of frame count, versus a linear increase (58 to 1,257 ms) for conventional methods. To facilitate further research, we contribute a publicly available streak-tube camera image dataset contains 2,695,168 real-world underwater 3D point cloud data. More importantly, we validate our UCLR system in a South China Sea trial, reaching an error of 46mm for 3D target at 1,000 m depth and 20 m range.

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty or confidence in the responses of a model can be significant in evaluating trust not only in the responses, but also in the model as a whole. In this paper, we explore the problem of estimating confidence for responses of large language models (LLMs) with simply black-box or query access to them. We propose a simple and extensible framework where, we engineer novel features and train a (interpretable) model (viz. logistic regression) on these features to estimate the confidence. We empirically demonstrate that our simple framework is effective in estimating confidence of Flan-ul2, Llama-13b, Mistral-7b and GPT-4 on four benchmark Q\&amp;A tasks as well as of Pegasus-large and BART-large on two benchmark summarization tasks with it surpassing baselines by even over $10\%$ (on AUROC) in some cases. Additionally, our interpretable approach provides insight into features that are predictive of confidence, leading to the interesting and useful discovery that our confidence models built for one LLM generalize zero-shot across others on a given dataset.

Abstract: We show that feedforward neural networks with ReLU activation generalize on low complexity data, suitably defined. Given i.i.d.~data generated from a simple programming language, the minimum description length (MDL) feedforward neural network which interpolates the data generalizes with high probability. We define this simple programming language, along with a notion of description length of such networks. We provide several examples on basic computational tasks, such as checking primality of a natural number. For primality testing, our theorem shows the following and more. Suppose that we draw an i.i.d.~sample of $n$ numbers uniformly at random from $1$ to $N$. For each number $x_i$, let $y_i = 1$ if $x_i$ is a prime and $0$ if it is not. Then, the interpolating MDL network accurately answers, with error probability $1- O((\ln N)/n)$, whether a newly drawn number between $1$ and $N$ is a prime or not. Note that the network is not designed to detect primes; minimum description learning discovers a network which does so. Extensions to noisy data are also discussed, suggesting that MDL neural network interpolators can demonstrate tempered overfitting.

We explore various pairing methods alongside established distance measures (Levenshtein distance, cosine similarity) and a sBERT model for semantic evaluation. Our findings suggest a potentially low prevalence of duplicates based on the observed semantic similarity across different methods. Further exploration with a human-annotated ground truth set is completed for a more conclusive assessment. The result supports findings from the NLP, LLM based distance metrics.

<title>Towards Competitive Search Relevance For Inference-Free Learned Sparse Retrievers</title>

Abstract: Learned sparse retrieval, which can efficiently perform retrieval through mature inverted-index engines, has garnered growing attention in recent years. Particularly, the inference-free sparse retrievers are attractive as they eliminate online model inference in the retrieval phase thereby avoids huge computational cost, offering reasonable throughput and latency. However, even the state-of-the-art (SOTA) inference-free sparse models lag far behind in terms of search relevance when compared to both sparse and dense siamese models. Towards competitive search relevance for inference-free sparse retrievers, we argue that they deserve dedicated training methods other than using same ones with siamese encoders. In this paper, we propose two different approaches for performance improvement. First, we propose an IDF-aware penalty for the matching function that suppresses the contribution of low-IDF tokens and increases the model's focus on informative terms. Moreover, we propose a heterogeneous ensemble knowledge distillation framework that combines siamese dense and sparse retrievers to generate supervisory signals during the pre-training phase. The ensemble framework of dense and sparse retriever capitalizes on their strengths respectively, providing a strong upper bound for knowledge distillation. To concur the diverse feedback from heterogeneous supervisors, we normalize and then aggregate the outputs of the teacher models to eliminate score scale differences. On the BEIR benchmark, our model outperforms existing SOTA inference-free sparse model by \textbf{3.3 NDCG@10 score}. It exhibits search relevance comparable to siamese sparse retrievers and client-side latency only \textbf{1.1x that of BM25}.

Abstract: Optimization algorithms are pivotal in advancing various scientific and industrial fields but often encounter obstacles such as trapping in local minima, saddle points, and plateaus (flat regions), which makes the convergence to reasonable or near-optimal solutions particularly challenging. This paper presents the Steepest Perturbed Gradient Descent (SPGD), a novel algorithm that innovatively combines the principles of the gradient descent method with periodic uniform perturbation sampling to effectively circumvent these impediments and lead to better solutions whenever possible. SPGD is distinctively designed to generate a set of candidate solutions and select the one exhibiting the steepest loss difference relative to the current solution. It enhances the traditional gradient descent approach by integrating a strategic exploration mechanism that significantly increases the likelihood of escaping sub-optimal local minima and navigating complex optimization landscapes effectively. Our approach not only retains the directed efficiency of gradient descent but also leverages the exploratory benefits of stochastic perturbations, thus enabling a more comprehensive search for global optima across diverse problem spaces. We demonstrate the efficacy of SPGD in solving the 3D component packing problem, an NP-hard challenge. Preliminary results show a substantial improvement over four established methods, particularly on response surfaces with complex topographies and in multidimensional non-convex continuous optimization problems. Comparative analyses with established 2D benchmark functions highlight SPGD's superior performance, showcasing its ability to navigate complex optimization landscapes. These results emphasize SPGD's potential as a versatile tool for a wide range of optimization problems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Video-Language Models (LVLMs) have led to promising results in multimodal video understanding. However, it remains unclear whether these models possess the cognitive capabilities required for high-level tasks, particularly those involving symbolic and abstract perception. Existing benchmarks typically rely on real-world, annotated videos, which lack control over video content and inherent difficulty, limiting their diagnostic power. To bridge this gap, we propose VideoCogQA, a scalable and fully controllable benchmark inspired by game-world environments, designed to evaluate the cognitive abilities of LVLMs. By generating synthetic videos via a programmatic engine, VideoCogQA allows fine-grained control over visual elements, temporal dynamics, and task difficulty. This approach enables a focused evaluation of video cognitive abilities, independent of prior knowledge from visual scene semantics. The dataset includes 800 videos and 3,280 question-answer pairs, featuring tasks related to abstract concepts, symbolic elements, and multimodal integration, with varying levels of difficulty. Experimental results show that even state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, such as GPT-4o, achieve an average performance of 48.8% on tasks involving abstract concepts. Additionally, performance drops by 15% as task complexity increases, highlighting the challenges LVLMs face in maintaining consistent performance. Through this work, we hope to show the limitations of current LVLMs and offer insights into how they can more effectively emulate human cognitive processes in the future.

Abstract: Efficient Visual Instruction Fine-Tuning (EVIT) seeks to adapt Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to downstream tasks with minimal computational overhead. However, as task diversity and complexity increase, EVIT faces significant challenges in resolving data conflicts. To address this limitation, we propose the Dual Low-Rank Adaptation (Dual-LoRA), a holistic-to-local framework that enhances the adapter's capacity to address data conflict through dual structural optimization. Specifically, we utilize two subspaces: a skill space for stable, holistic knowledge retention, and a rank-rectified task space that locally activates the holistic knowledge. Additionally, we introduce Visual Cue Enhancement (VCE), a multi-level local feature aggregation module designed to enrich the vision-language projection with local details. Our approach is both memory- and time-efficient, requiring only 1.16$\times$ the inference time of the standard LoRA method (with injection into the query and value projection layers), and just 73\% of the inference time of a 4-expert LoRA-MoE. Extensive experiments on various downstream tasks and general MLLM benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

Abstract: 3D head stylization transforms realistic facial features into artistic representations, enhancing user engagement across gaming and virtual reality applications. While 3D-aware generators have made significant advancements, many 3D stylization methods primarily provide near-frontal views and struggle to preserve the unique identities of original subjects, often resulting in outputs that lack diversity and individuality. This paper addresses these challenges by leveraging the PanoHead model, synthesizing images from a comprehensive 360-degree perspective. We propose a novel framework that employs negative log-likelihood distillation (LD) to enhance identity preservation and improve stylization quality. By integrating multi-view grid score and mirror gradients within the 3D GAN architecture and introducing a score rank weighing technique, our approach achieves substantial qualitative and quantitative improvements. Our findings not only advance the state of 3D head stylization but also provide valuable insights into effective distillation processes between diffusion models and GANs, focusing on the critical issue of identity preservation.

<title>SMoLoRA: Exploring and Defying Dual Catastrophic Forgetting in Continual Visual Instruction Tuning</title>

Abstract: Visual instruction tuning (VIT) enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to effectively handle a wide range of vision tasks by framing them as language-based instructions. Building on this, continual visual instruction tuning (CVIT) extends the capability of MLLMs to incrementally learn new tasks, accommodating evolving functionalities. While prior work has advanced CVIT through the development of new benchmarks and approaches to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, these efforts largely follow traditional continual learning paradigms, neglecting the unique challenges specific to CVIT. We identify a dual form of catastrophic forgetting in CVIT, where MLLMs not only forget previously learned visual understanding but also experience a decline in instruction following abilities as they acquire new tasks. To address this, we introduce the Separable Mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation (SMoLoRA) framework, which employs separable routing through two distinct modules-one for visual understanding and another for instruction following. This dual-routing design enables specialized adaptation in both domains, preventing forgetting while improving performance. Furthermore, we propose a new CVIT benchmark that goes beyond existing benchmarks by additionally evaluating a model's ability to generalize to unseen tasks and handle diverse instructions across various tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SMoLoRA outperforms existing methods in mitigating dual forgetting, improving generalization to unseen tasks, and ensuring robustness in following diverse instructions.

<title>An Automatic Graph Construction Framework based on Large Language Models for Recommendation</title>

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as state-of-the-art methods to learn from graph-structured data for recommendation. However, most existing GNN-based recommendation methods focus on the optimization of model structures and learning strategies based on pre-defined graphs, neglecting the importance of the graph construction stage. Earlier works for graph construction usually rely on speciffic rules or crowdsourcing, which are either too simplistic or too labor-intensive. Recent works start to utilize large language models (LLMs) to automate the graph construction, in view of their abundant open-world knowledge and remarkable reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, they generally suffer from two limitations: (1) invisibility of global view (e.g., overlooking contextual information) and (2) construction inefficiency. To this end, we introduce AutoGraph, an automatic graph construction framework based on LLMs for recommendation. Specifically, we first use LLMs to infer the user preference and item knowledge, which is encoded as semantic vectors. Next, we employ vector quantization to extract the latent factors from the semantic vectors. The latent factors are then incorporated as extra nodes to link the user/item nodes, resulting in a graph with in-depth global-view semantics. We further design metapath-based message aggregation to effectively aggregate the semantic and collaborative information. The framework is model-agnostic and compatible with different backbone models. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy and efffciency of AutoGraph compared to existing baseline methods. We have deployed AutoGraph in Huawei advertising platform, and gain a 2.69% improvement on RPM and a 7.31% improvement on eCPM in the online A/B test. Currently AutoGraph has been used as the main trafffc model, serving hundreds of millions of people.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence offers a promising avenue for materials discovery, yet its advantages over traditional methods remain unclear. In this work, we introduce and benchmark two baseline approaches - random enumeration of charge-balanced prototypes and data-driven ion exchange of known compounds - against four generative techniques based on diffusion models, variational autoencoders, and large language models. Our results show that established methods such as ion exchange are better at generating novel materials that are stable, although many of these closely resemble known compounds. In contrast, generative models excel at proposing novel structural frameworks and, when sufficient training data is available, can more effectively target properties such as electronic band gap and bulk modulus. To enhance the performance of both the baseline and generative approaches, we implement a post-generation screening step in which all proposed structures are passed through stability and property filters from pre-trained machine learning models including universal interatomic potentials. This low-cost filtering step leads to substantial improvement in the success rates of all methods, remains computationally efficient, and ultimately provides a practical pathway toward more effective generative strategies for materials discovery. By establishing baselines for comparison, this work highlights opportunities for continued advancement of generative models, especially for the targeted generation of novel materials that are thermodynamically stable.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been adopted to perform text-to-SQL tasks, utilizing their in-context learning (ICL) capability to translate natural language questions into structured query language (SQL). However, such a technique faces correctness problems and requires efficient repairing solutions. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive study of text-to-SQL errors. Our study covers four representative ICL-based techniques, five basic repairing methods, two benchmarks, and two LLM settings. We find that text-to-SQL errors are widespread and summarize 29 error types of 7 categories. We also find that existing repairing attempts have limited correctness improvement at the cost of high computational overhead with many mis-repairs. Based on the findings, we propose MapleRepair, a novel text-to-SQL error detection and repairing framework. The evaluation demonstrates that MapleRepair outperforms existing solutions by repairing 13.8% more queries with neglectable mis-repairs and 67.4% less overhead.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning offers an appealing solution for remote sensing (RS) image segmentation to relieve the burden of labor-intensive pixel-level labeling. However, RS images pose unique challenges, including rich multi-scale features and high inter-class similarity. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised Multi-Scale Uncertainty and Cross-Teacher-Student Attention (MUCA) model for RS image semantic segmentation tasks. Specifically, MUCA constrains the consistency among feature maps at different layers of the network by introducing a multi-scale uncertainty consistency regularization. It improves the multi-scale learning capability of semi-supervised algorithms on unlabeled data. Additionally, MUCA utilizes a Cross-Teacher-Student attention mechanism to guide the student network, guiding the student network to construct more discriminative feature representations through complementary features from the teacher network. This design effectively integrates weak and strong augmentations (WA and SA) to further boost segmentation performance. To verify the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on ISPRS-Potsdam and LoveDA datasets. The experimental results show the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods. Notably, our model excels in distinguishing highly similar objects, showcasing its potential for advancing semi-supervised RS image segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Robustness is essential for deep neural networks, especially in security-sensitive applications. To this end, randomized smoothing provides theoretical guarantees for certifying robustness against adversarial perturbations. Recently, diffusion models have been successfully employed for randomized smoothing to purify noise-perturbed samples before making predictions with a standard classifier. While these methods excel at small perturbation radii, they struggle with larger perturbations and incur a significant computational overhead during inference compared to classical methods. To address this, we reformulate the generative modeling task along the diffusion trajectories in pixel space as a discriminative task in the latent space. Specifically, we use instance discrimination to achieve consistent representations along the trajectories by aligning temporally adjacent points. After fine-tuning based on the learned representations, our model enables implicit denoising-then-classification via a single prediction, substantially reducing inference costs. We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performance with minimal computation budget during inference. For example, our method outperforms the certified accuracy of diffusion-based methods on ImageNet across all perturbation radii by 5.3% on average, with up to 11.6% at larger radii, while reducing inference costs by 85$\times$ on average.

Abstract: We address the problem of quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) under model-free settings with quantum oracle access to the Markov Decision Process (MDP). This paper introduces a Quantum Natural Policy Gradient (QNPG) algorithm, which replaces the random sampling used in classical Natural Policy Gradient (NPG) estimators with a deterministic gradient estimation approach, enabling seamless integration into quantum systems. While this modification introduces a bounded bias in the estimator, the bias decays exponentially with increasing truncation levels. This paper demonstrates that the proposed QNPG algorithm achieves a sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-1.5})$ for queries to the quantum oracle, significantly improving the classical lower bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ for queries to the MDP.

Abstract: In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) enables agents to learn automatically and on-the-fly from their interactive experiences. However, a major challenge in scaling up ICRL is the lack of scalable task collections. To address this, we propose the procedurally generated tabular Markov Decision Processes, named AnyMDP. Through a carefully designed randomization process, AnyMDP is capable of generating high-quality tasks on a large scale while maintaining relatively low structural biases. To facilitate efficient meta-training at scale, we further introduce step-wise supervision and induce prior information in the ICRL framework.Our results demonstrate that, with a sufficiently large scale of AnyMDP tasks, the proposed model can generalize to tasks that were not considered in the training set. The scalable task set provided by AnyMDP also enables a more thorough empirical investigation of the relationship between data distribution and ICRL performance. We further show that the generalization of ICRL potentially comes at the cost of increased task diversity and longer adaptation periods. This finding carries critical implications for scaling robust ICRL capabilities, highlighting the necessity of diverse and extensive task design, and prioritizing asymptotic performance over few-shot adaptation.

<title>The Hidden Life of Tokens: Reducing Hallucination of Large Vision-Language Models via Visual Information Steering</title>

arXiv:2502.03628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can reason effectively over both textual and visual inputs, but they tend to hallucinate syntactically coherent yet visually ungrounded contents. In this paper, we investigate the internal dynamics of hallucination by examining the tokens logits ranking throughout the generation process, revealing three key patterns in how LVLMs process information: (1) gradual visual information loss - visually grounded tokens gradually become less favored throughout generation, and (2) early excitation - semantically meaningful tokens achieve peak activation in the layers earlier than the final layer. (3) hidden genuine information - visually grounded tokens though not being eventually decoded still retain relatively high rankings at inference. Based on these insights, we propose VISTA (Visual Information Steering with Token-logit Augmentation), a training-free inference-time intervention framework that reduces hallucination while promoting genuine information. VISTA works by combining two complementary approaches: reinforcing visual information in activation space and leveraging early layer activations to promote semantically meaningful decoding. Compared to existing methods, VISTA requires no external supervision and is applicable to various decoding strategies. Extensive experiments show that VISTA on average reduces hallucination by about 40% on evaluated open-ended generation task, and it consistently outperforms existing methods on four benchmarks across four architectures under three decoding strategies. Code is available at https://github.com/LzVv123456/VISTA.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents capable of autonomous learning and independent decision-making hold great promise for addressing complex challenges across various critical infrastructure domains, including transportation, energy systems, and manufacturing. However, the surge in the design and deployment of AI systems, driven by various stakeholders with distinct and unaligned objectives, introduces a crucial challenge: How can uncoordinated AI systems coexist and evolve harmoniously in shared environments without creating chaos or compromising safety? To address this, we advocate for a fundamental rethinking of existing multi-agent frameworks, such as multi-agent systems and game theory, which are largely limited to predefined rules and static objective structures. We posit that AI agents should be empowered to adjust their objectives dynamically, make compromises, form coalitions, and safely compete or cooperate through evolving relationships and social feedback. Through two case studies in critical infrastructure applications, we call for a shift toward the emergent, self-organizing, and context-aware nature of these multi-agentic AI systems.

<title>The Curse of Depth in Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2502.05795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Curse of Depth, a concept that highlights, explains, and addresses the recent observation in modern Large Language Models (LLMs) where nearly half of the layers are less effective than expected. We first confirm the wide existence of this phenomenon across the most popular families of LLMs such as Llama, Mistral, DeepSeek, and Qwen. Our analysis, theoretically and empirically, identifies that the underlying reason for the ineffectiveness of deep layers in LLMs is the widespread usage of Pre-Layer Normalization (Pre-LN). While Pre-LN stabilizes the training of Transformer LLMs, its output variance exponentially grows with the model depth, which undesirably causes the derivative of the deep Transformer blocks to be an identity matrix, and therefore barely contributes to the training. To resolve this training pitfall, we propose LayerNorm Scaling (LNS), which scales the variance of output of the layer normalization inversely by the square root of its depth. This simple modification mitigates the output variance explosion of deeper Transformer layers, improving their contribution. Across a wide range of model sizes (130M to 7B), our experiments show that LNS consistently outperforms previous normalization and scaling techniques in enhancing LLM pre-training performance. Moreover, this improvement seamlessly carries over to supervised fine-tuning. All these gains can be attributed to the fact that LayerNorm Scaling enables deeper layers to contribute more effectively during training. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/lmsdss/LayerNorm-Scaling}{LayerNorm-Scaling}.

Abstract: We consider the problem of conformal prediction under covariate shift. Given labeled data from a source domain and unlabeled data from a covariate shifted target domain, we seek to construct prediction sets with valid marginal coverage in the target domain. Most existing methods require estimating the unknown likelihood ratio function, which can be prohibitive for high-dimensional data such as images. To address this challenge, we introduce the likelihood ratio regularized quantile regression (LR-QR) algorithm, which combines the pinball loss with a novel choice of regularization in order to construct a threshold function without directly estimating the unknown likelihood ratio. We show that the LR-QR method has coverage at the desired level in the target domain, up to a small error term that we can control. Our proofs draw on a novel analysis of coverage via stability bounds from learning theory. Our experiments demonstrate that the LR-QR algorithm outperforms existing methods on high-dimensional prediction tasks, including a regression task for the Communities and Crime dataset, an image classification task from the WILDS repository, and an LLM question-answering task on the MMLU benchmark.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in task-oriented applications, yet building emotionally intelligent chatbots that can engage in natural, strategic conversations remains a challenge. We present a novel approach called SAGE that uses latent variables to control long-horizon behavior in dialogue generation. At the core of our method is the State-Action Chain (SAC), which augments standard language model fine-tuning by introducing latent variables that encapsulate emotional states and conversational strategies between dialogue turns. During inference, these variables are generated before each response, enabling coarse-grained control over dialogue progression while maintaining natural interaction patterns. We also introduce a self-improvement pipeline that leverages dialogue tree search, LLM-based reward modeling, and targeted fine-tuning to optimize conversational trajectories. Our experimental results show that models trained with this approach demonstrate improved performance in emotional intelligence metrics while maintaining strong capabilities on LLM benchmarks. The discrete nature of our latent variables facilitates search-based strategies and provides a foundation for future applications of reinforcement learning to dialogue systems, where learning can occur at the state level rather than the token level. https://github.com/apple/ml-sage-dialog-gen

<title>Mitigating Hallucinations in YOLO-based Object Detection Models: A Revisit to Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>

Abstract: Object detection systems must reliably perceive objects of interest without being overly confident to ensure safe decision-making in dynamic environments. Filtering techniques based on out-of-distribution (OoD) detection are commonly added as an extra safeguard to filter hallucinations caused by overconfidence in novel objects. Nevertheless, evaluating YOLO-family detectors and their filters under existing OoD benchmarks often leads to unsatisfactory performance. This paper studies the underlying reasons for performance bottlenecks and proposes a methodology to improve performance fundamentally. Our first contribution is a calibration of all existing evaluation results: Although images in existing OoD benchmark datasets are claimed not to have objects within in-distribution (ID) classes (i.e., categories defined in the training dataset), around 13% of objects detected by the object detector are actually ID objects. Dually, the ID dataset containing OoD objects can also negatively impact the decision boundary of filters. These ultimately lead to a significantly imprecise performance estimation. Our second contribution is to consider the task of hallucination reduction as a joint pipeline of detectors and filters. By developing a methodology to carefully synthesize an OoD dataset that semantically resembles the objects to be detected, and using the crafted OoD dataset in the fine-tuning of YOLO detectors to suppress the objectness score, we achieve a 88% reduction in overall hallucination error with a combined fine-tuned detection and filtering system on the self-driving benchmark BDD-100K.

Abstract: Multi-agent collaborative perception enhances each agent perceptual capabilities by sharing sensing information to cooperatively perform robot perception tasks. This approach has proven effective in addressing challenges such as sensor deficiencies, occlusions, and long-range perception. However, existing representative collaborative perception systems transmit intermediate feature maps, such as bird-eye view (BEV) representations, which contain a significant amount of non-critical information, leading to high communication bandwidth requirements. To enhance communication efficiency while preserving perception capability, we introduce CoCMT, an object-query-based collaboration framework that optimizes communication bandwidth by selectively extracting and transmitting essential features. Within CoCMT, we introduce the Efficient Query Transformer (EQFormer) to effectively fuse multi-agent object queries and implement a synergistic deep supervision to enhance the positive reinforcement between stages, leading to improved overall performance. Experiments on OPV2V and V2V4Real datasets show CoCMT outperforms state-of-the-art methods while drastically reducing communication needs. On V2V4Real, our model (Top-50 object queries) requires only 0.416 Mb bandwidth, 83 times less than SOTA methods, while improving AP70 by 1.1 percent. This efficiency breakthrough enables practical collaborative perception deployment in bandwidth-constrained environments without sacrificing detection accuracy.

Abstract: A CAD command sequence is a typical parametric design paradigm in 3D CAD systems where a model is constructed by overlaying 2D sketches with operations such as extrusion, revolution, and Boolean operations. Although there is growing academic interest in the automatic generation of command sequences, existing methods and datasets only support operations such as 2D sketching, extrusion,and Boolean operations. This limitation makes it challenging to represent more complex geometries. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning (RL) training environment (gym) built on a CAD geometric engine. Given an input boundary representation (B-Rep) geometry, the policy network in the RL algorithm generates an action. This action, along with previously generated actions, is processed within the gym to produce the corresponding CAD geometry, which is then fed back into the policy network. The rewards, determined by the difference between the generated and target geometries within the gym, are used to update the RL network. Our method supports operations beyond sketches, Boolean, and extrusion, including revolution operations. With this training gym, we achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) quality in generating command sequences from B-Rep geometries.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in assisting scientific research, yet their ability to discover high-quality research hypotheses remains unexamined due to the lack of a dedicated benchmark. To address this gap, we introduce the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating LLMs with a near-sufficient set of sub-tasks of scientific discovery: inspiration retrieval, hypothesis composition, and hypothesis ranking. We develop an automated framework that extracts critical components - research questions, background surveys, inspirations, and hypotheses - from scientific papers across 12 disciplines, with expert validation confirming its accuracy. To prevent data contamination, we focus exclusively on papers published in 2024, ensuring minimal overlap with LLM pretraining data. Our evaluation reveals that LLMs perform well in retrieving inspirations, an out-of-distribution task, suggesting their ability to surface novel knowledge associations. This positions LLMs as "research hypothesis mines", capable of facilitating automated scientific discovery by generating innovative hypotheses at scale with minimal human intervention.

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have been prominent for language translation, including low-resource languages. There has been limited study on the assessment of the quality of translations generated by LLMs, including Gemini, GPT, and Google Translate. This study addresses this limitation by using semantic and sentiment analysis of selected LLMs for Indian languages, including Sanskrit, Telugu and Hindi. We select prominent texts (Bhagavad Gita, Tamas and Maha Prasthanam ) that have been well translated by experts and use LLMs to generate their translations into English, and provide a comparison with selected expert (human) translations. Our investigation revealed that while LLMs have made significant progress in translation accuracy, challenges remain in preserving sentiment and semantic integrity, especially in metaphorical and philosophical contexts for texts such as the Bhagavad Gita. The sentiment analysis revealed that GPT models are better at preserving the sentiment polarity for the given texts when compared to human (expert) translation. The results revealed that GPT models are generally better at maintaining the sentiment and semantics when compared to Google Translate. This study could help in the development of accurate and culturally sensitive translation systems for large language models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models have demonstrated how chain-of-thought (CoT) and reinforcement learning (RL) can improve performance. However, applying such reasoning strategies to the visual generation domain remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present T2I-R1, a novel reasoning-enhanced text-to-image generation model, powered by RL with a bi-level CoT reasoning process. Specifically, we identify two levels of CoT that can be utilized to enhance different stages of generation: (1) the semantic-level CoT for high-level planning of the prompt and (2) the token-level CoT for low-level pixel processing during patch-by-patch generation. To better coordinate these two levels of CoT, we introduce BiCoT-GRPO with an ensemble of generation rewards, which seamlessly optimizes both generation CoTs within the same training step. By applying our reasoning strategies to the baseline model, Janus-Pro, we achieve superior performance with 13% improvement on T2I-CompBench and 19% improvement on the WISE benchmark, even surpassing the state-of-the-art model FLUX.1.

arXiv:2505.00949v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Llama-Nemotron series of models, an open family of heterogeneous reasoning models that deliver exceptional reasoning capabilities, inference efficiency, and an open license for enterprise use. The family comes in three sizes -- Nano (8B), Super (49B), and Ultra (253B) -- and performs competitively with state-of-the-art reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 while offering superior inference throughput and memory efficiency. In this report, we discuss the training procedure for these models, which entails using neural architecture search from Llama 3 models for accelerated inference, knowledge distillation, and continued pretraining, followed by a reasoning-focused post-training stage consisting of two main parts: supervised fine-tuning and large scale reinforcement learning. Llama-Nemotron models are the first open-source models to support a dynamic reasoning toggle, allowing users to switch between standard chat and reasoning modes during inference. To further support open research and facilitate model development, we provide the following resources: 1. We release the Llama-Nemotron reasoning models -- LN-Nano, LN-Super, and LN-Ultra -- under the commercially permissive NVIDIA Open Model License Agreement. 2. We release the complete post-training dataset: Llama-Nemotron-Post-Training-Dataset. 3. We also release our training codebases: NeMo, NeMo-Aligner, and Megatron-LM.

arXiv:2505.09438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now widely accessible, reaching learners at all educational levels. This development has raised concerns that their use may circumvent essential learning processes and compromise the integrity of established assessment formats. In physics education, where problem solving plays a central role in instruction and assessment, it is therefore essential to understand the physics-specific problem-solving capabilities of LLMs. Such understanding is key to informing responsible and pedagogically sound approaches to integrating LLMs into instruction and assessment. This study therefore compares the problem-solving performance of a general-purpose LLM (GPT-4o, using varying prompting techniques) and a reasoning-optimized model (o1-preview) with that of participants of the German Physics Olympiad, based on a set of well-defined Olympiad problems. In addition to evaluating the correctness of the generated solutions, the study analyzes characteristic strengths and limitations of LLM-generated solutions. The findings of this study indicate that both tested LLMs (GPT-4o and o1-preview) demonstrate advanced problem-solving capabilities on Olympiad-type physics problems, on average outperforming the human participants. Prompting techniques had little effect on GPT-4o's performance, while o1-preview almost consistently outperformed both GPT-4o and the human benchmark. Based on these findings, the study discusses implications for the design of summative and formative assessment in physics education, including how to uphold assessment integrity and support students in critically engaging with LLMs.

Abstract: The rapid advancement and expanding applications of Audio Large Language Models (ALLMs) demand a rigorous understanding of their trustworthiness. However, systematic research on evaluating these models, particularly concerning risks unique to the audio modality, remains largely unexplored. Existing evaluation frameworks primarily focus on the text modality or address only a restricted set of safety dimensions, failing to adequately account for the unique characteristics and application scenarios inherent to the audio modality. We introduce AudioTrust-the first multifaceted trustworthiness evaluation framework and benchmark specifically designed for ALLMs. AudioTrust facilitates assessments across six key dimensions: fairness, hallucination, safety, privacy, robustness, and authentication. To comprehensively evaluate these dimensions, AudioTrust is structured around 18 distinct experimental setups. Its core is a meticulously constructed dataset of over 4,420 audio/text samples, drawn from real-world scenarios (e.g., daily conversations, emergency calls, voice assistant interactions), specifically designed to probe the multifaceted trustworthiness of ALLMs. For assessment, the benchmark carefully designs 9 audio-specific evaluation metrics, and we employ a large-scale automated pipeline for objective and scalable scoring of model outputs. Experimental results reveal the trustworthiness boundaries and limitations of current state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source ALLMs when confronted with various high-risk audio scenarios, offering valuable insights for the secure and trustworthy deployment of future audio models. Our platform and benchmark are available at https://github.com/JusperLee/AudioTrust.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent in global applications, ensuring that they are toxicity-free across diverse linguistic contexts remains a critical challenge. We explore "Cross-lingual Detoxification", a cross-lingual paradigm that mitigates toxicity, enabling detoxification capabilities to transfer between high and low-resource languages across different script families. We analyze cross-lingual detoxification's effectiveness through 392 extensive settings to evaluate toxicity reduction in cross-distribution settings with limited data and investigate how mitigation impacts model performance on non-toxic tasks, revealing trade-offs between safety and knowledge preservation.

<title>From Tokens to Thoughts: How LLMs and Humans Trade Compression for Meaning</title>

arXiv:2505.17117v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans organize knowledge into compact categories through semantic compression by mapping diverse instances to abstract representations while preserving meaning (e.g., robin and blue jay are both birds; most birds can fly). These concepts reflect a trade-off between expressive fidelity and representational simplicity. Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable linguistic abilities, yet whether their internal representations strike a human-like trade-off between compression and semantic fidelity is unclear. We introduce a novel information-theoretic framework, drawing from Rate-Distortion Theory and the Information Bottleneck principle, to quantitatively compare these strategies. Analyzing token embeddings from a diverse suite of LLMs against seminal human categorization benchmarks, we uncover key divergences. While LLMs form broad conceptual categories that align with human judgment, they struggle to capture the fine-grained semantic distinctions crucial for human understanding. More fundamentally, LLMs demonstrate a strong bias towards aggressive statistical compression, whereas human conceptual systems appear to prioritize adaptive nuance and contextual richness, even if this results in lower compressional efficiency by our measures. These findings illuminate critical differences between current AI and human cognitive architectures, guiding pathways toward LLMs with more human-aligned conceptual representations.

<title>Two-Stage Regularization-Based Structured Pruning for LLMs</title>

arXiv:2505.18232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is largely hindered by their large number of parameters. Structural pruning has emerged as a promising solution. Prior structured pruning methods directly remove unimportant parameters based on certain metrics, which often causes knowledge loss and necessitates extensive retraining. To overcome this, we introduce a novel pruning method TRSP: Two-Stage Regularization-Based Structured Pruning for LLMs. Specifically, we multiply the output of each transformer layer by an initial learnable weight and iteratively learn these weights by adding their $\ell_1$-norm as a regularization term to the loss function, serving as the first-stage regularization. Subsequently, we apply additional regularization to the difference between the output and input of layers with smaller weights, encouraging the shift of knowledge to the preserved layers. This serves as the second-stage regularization. TRSP retains more knowledge and better preserves model performance than direct parameter elimination. Through extensive experimentation we show that TRSP outperforms strong layer-wise structured pruning methods without requiring retraining. As a layer-wise pruning method, it delivers notable end-to-end acceleration, making it a promising solution for efficient LLM deployment.

Abstract: Recent advancements in AI agents have demonstrated their growing potential to drive and support scientific discovery. In this work, we introduce MLR-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI agents on open-ended machine learning research. MLR-Bench includes three key components: (1) 201 research tasks sourced from NeurIPS, ICLR, and ICML workshops covering diverse ML topics; (2) MLR-Judge, an automated evaluation framework combining LLM-based reviewers with carefully designed review rubrics to assess research quality; and (3) MLR-Agent, a modular agent scaffold capable of completing research tasks through four stages: idea generation, proposal formulation, experimentation, and paper writing. Our framework supports both stepwise assessment across these distinct research stages, and end-to-end evaluation of the final research paper. We then use MLR-Bench to evaluate six frontier LLMs and an advanced coding agent, finding that while LLMs are effective at generating coherent ideas and well-structured papers, current coding agents frequently (e.g., in 80% of the cases) produce fabricated or invalidated experimental results--posing a major barrier to scientific reliability. We validate MLR-Judge through human evaluation, showing high agreement with expert reviewers, supporting its potential as a scalable tool for research evaluation. We open-source MLR-Bench to help the community benchmark, diagnose, and improve AI research agents toward trustworthy and transparent scientific discovery.

<title>Avoid Forgetting by Preserving Global Knowledge Gradients in Federated Learning with Non-IID Data</title>

Abstract: The inevitable presence of data heterogeneity has made federated learning very challenging. There are numerous methods to deal with this issue, such as local regularization, better model fusion techniques, and data sharing. Though effective, they lack a deep understanding of how data heterogeneity can affect the global decision boundary. In this paper, we bridge this gap by performing an experimental analysis of the learned decision boundary using a toy example. Our observations are surprising: (1) we find that the existing methods suffer from forgetting and clients forget the global decision boundary and only learn the perfect local one, and (2) this happens regardless of the initial weights, and clients forget the global decision boundary even starting from pre-trained optimal weights. In this paper, we present FedProj, a federated learning framework that robustly learns the global decision boundary and avoids its forgetting during local training. To achieve better ensemble knowledge fusion, we design a novel server-side ensemble knowledge transfer loss to further calibrate the learned global decision boundary. To alleviate the issue of learned global decision boundary forgetting, we further propose leveraging an episodic memory of average ensemble logits on a public unlabeled dataset to regulate the gradient updates at each step of local training. Experimental results demonstrate that FedProj outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

arXiv:2505.24625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous research has investigated the application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in understanding 3D scenes by interpreting them as videos. These approaches generally depend on comprehensive 3D data inputs, such as point clouds or reconstructed Bird's-Eye View (BEV) maps. In our research, we advance this field by enhancing the capability of MLLMs to understand and reason in 3D spaces directly from video data, without the need for additional 3D input. We propose a novel and efficient method, the Video-3D Geometry Large Language Model (VG LLM). Our approach employs a 3D visual geometry encoder that extracts 3D prior information from video sequences. This information is integrated with visual tokens and fed into the MLLM. Extensive experiments have shown that our method has achieved substantial improvements in various tasks related to 3D scene understanding and spatial reasoning, all directly learned from video sources. Impressively, our 4B model, which does not rely on explicit 3D data inputs, achieves competitive results compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and even surpasses the Gemini-1.5-Pro in the VSI-Bench evaluations.

arXiv:2506.02007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present eACGM, a full-stack AI/ML system monitoring framework based on eBPF. eACGM collects real-time performance data from key hardware components, including the GPU and network communication layer, as well as from key software stacks such as CUDA, Python, and PyTorch, all without requiring any code instrumentation or modifications. Additionally, it leverages libnvml to gather process-level GPU resource usage information. By applying a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to the collected multidimensional performance metrics for statistical modeling and clustering analysis, eACGM effectively identifies complex failure modes, such as latency anomalies, hardware failures, and communication inefficiencies, enabling rapid diagnosis of system bottlenecks and abnormal behaviors.
  To evaluate eACGM's effectiveness and practicality, we conducted extensive empirical studies and case analyses in multi-node distributed training scenarios. The results demonstrate that eACGM, while maintaining a non-intrusive and low-overhead profile, successfully captures critical performance anomalies during model training and inference. Its stable anomaly detection performance and comprehensive monitoring capabilities validate its applicability and scalability in real-world production environments, providing strong support for performance optimization and fault diagnosis in large-scale AI/ML systems.

Abstract: The Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) is a widely adopted trajectory optimizer in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), but its unimodal sampling strategy often leads to premature convergence in multimodal landscapes. In this work, we propose Bregman Centroid Guided CEM ($\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM), a lightweight enhancement to ensemble CEM that leverages $\textit{Bregman centroids}$ for principled information aggregation and diversity control. $\textbf{$\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM}$ computes a performance-weighted Bregman centroid across CEM workers and updates the least contributing ones by sampling within a trust region around the centroid. Leveraging the duality between Bregman divergences and exponential family distributions, we show that $\textbf{$\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM}$ integrates seamlessly into standard CEM pipelines with negligible overhead. Empirical results on synthetic benchmarks, a cluttered navigation task, and full MBRL pipelines demonstrate that $\textbf{$\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM}$ enhances both convergence and solution quality, providing a simple yet effective upgrade for CEM.

Abstract: Deploying a Machine Learning (ML) training pipeline into production requires good software engineering practices. Unfortunately, the typical data science workflow often leads to code that lacks critical software quality attributes. This experience report investigates this problem in SPIRA, a project whose goal is to create an ML-Enabled System (MLES) to pre-diagnose insufficiency respiratory via speech analysis. This paper presents an overview of the architecture of the MLES, then compares three versions of its Continuous Training subsystem: from a proof of concept Big Ball of Mud (v1), to a design pattern-based Modular Monolith (v2), to a test-driven set of Microservices (v3) Each version improved its overall extensibility, maintainability, robustness, and resiliency. The paper shares challenges and lessons learned in this process, offering insights for researchers and practitioners seeking to productionize their pipelines.

<title>Beyond Attention or Similarity: Maximizing Conditional Diversity for Token Pruning in MLLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10967</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.10967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the length of input visual tokens is often significantly greater than that of their textual counterparts, leading to a high inference cost. Many works aim to address this issue by removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner, which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/Theia-4869/CDPruner.

Abstract: Recent work uses reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune text-to-image diffusion models, improving text-image alignment and sample quality. However, existing approaches introduce unnecessary complexity: they cache the full sampling trajectory, depend on differentiable reward models or large preference datasets, or require specialized guidance techniques. Motivated by the "golden noise" hypothesis -- that certain initial noise samples can consistently yield superior alignment -- we introduce Noise PPO, a minimalist RL algorithm that leaves the pre-trained diffusion model entirely frozen and learns a prompt-conditioned initial noise generator. Our approach requires no trajectory storage, reward backpropagation, or complex guidance tricks. Extensive experiments show that optimizing the initial noise distribution consistently improves alignment and sample quality over the original model, with the most significant gains at low inference steps. As the number of inference steps increases, the benefit of noise optimization diminishes but remains present. These findings clarify the scope and limitations of the golden noise hypothesis and reinforce the practical value of minimalist RL fine-tuning for diffusion models.

Abstract: Existing segmentation models trained on a single medical imaging dataset often lack robustness when encountering unseen organs or tumors. Developing a robust model capable of identifying rare or novel tumor categories not present during training is crucial for advancing medical imaging applications. We propose DSM, a novel framework that leverages diffusion and state space models to segment unseen tumor categories beyond the training data. DSM utilizes two sets of object queries trained within modified attention decoders to enhance classification accuracy. Initially, the model learns organ queries using an object-aware feature grouping strategy to capture organ-level visual features. It then refines tumor queries by focusing on diffusion-based visual prompts, enabling precise segmentation of previously unseen tumors. Furthermore, we incorporate diffusion-guided feature fusion to improve semantic segmentation performance. By integrating CLIP text embeddings, DSM captures category-sensitive classes to improve linguistic transfer knowledge, thereby enhancing the model's robustness across diverse scenarios and multi-label tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of DSM in various tumor segmentation tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Rows21/k-Means_Mask_Mamba.

Abstract: In this work, we provide a systematic survey of Discrete Diffusion Language Models (dLLMs) and Discrete Diffusion Multimodal Language Models (dMLLMs). Unlike autoregressive (AR) models, dLLMs and dMLLMs adopt a multi-token, parallel decoding paradigm using full attention and a denoising-based generation strategy. This paradigm naturally enables parallel generation, fine-grained output controllability, and dynamic, response-aware perception. These capabilities are previously difficult to achieve with AR models. Recently, a growing number of industrial-scale proprietary d(M)LLMs, as well as a large number of open-source academic d(M)LLMs, have demonstrated performance comparable to their autoregressive counterparts, while achieving up to 10x acceleration in inference speed.
  The advancement of discrete diffusion LLMs and MLLMs has been largely driven by progress in two domains. The first is the development of autoregressive LLMs and MLLMs, which has accumulated vast amounts of data, benchmarks, and foundational infrastructure for training and inference. The second contributing domain is the evolution of the mathematical models underlying discrete diffusion. Together, these advancements have catalyzed a surge in dLLMs and dMLLMs research in early 2025.
  In this work, we present a comprehensive overview of the research in the dLLM and dMLLM domains. We trace the historical development of dLLMs and dMLLMs, formalize the underlying mathematical frameworks, and categorize representative models. We further analyze key techniques for training and inference, and summarize emerging applications across language, vision-language, and biological domains. We conclude by discussing future directions for research and deployment.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a predominant method for graph representation learning. However, beyond subgraph frequency estimation, their application to network motif significance-profile (SP) prediction remains under-explored, with no established benchmarks in the literature. We propose to address this problem, framing SP estimation as a task independent of subgraph frequency estimation. Our approach shifts from frequency counting to direct SP estimation and modulates the problem as multitarget regression. The reformulation is optimised for interpretability, stability and scalability on large graphs. We validate our method using a large synthetic dataset and further test it on real-world graphs. Our experiments reveal that 1-WL limited models struggle to make precise estimations of SPs. However, they can generalise to approximate the graph generation processes of networks by comparing their predicted SP with the ones originating from synthetic generators. This first study on GNN-based motif estimation also hints at how using direct SP estimation can help go past the theoretical limitations that motif estimation faces when performed through subgraph counting.

Abstract: Current recommendation systems often require some form of textual data summarization, such as generating concise and coherent titles for product carousels or other grouped item displays. While large language models have shown promise in NLP domains for textual summarization, these approaches do not directly apply to recommendation systems, where explanations must be highly relevant to the core features of item sets, adhere to strict word limit constraints. In this paper, we propose CARTS (Collaborative Agents for Recommendation Textual Summarization), a multi-agent LLM framework designed for structured summarization in recommendation systems. CARTS decomposes the task into three stages-Generation Augmented Generation (GAG), refinement circle, and arbitration, where successive agent roles are responsible for extracting salient item features, iteratively refining candidate titles based on relevance and length feedback, and selecting the final title through a collaborative arbitration process. Experiments on large-scale e-commerce data and live A/B testing show that CARTS significantly outperforms single-pass and chain-of-thought LLM baselines, delivering higher title relevance and improved user engagement metrics.

Abstract: Benchmarks like Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) have played a pivotal role in evaluating AI's knowledge and abilities across diverse domains. However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on content knowledge, leaving a critical gap in assessing models' understanding of pedagogy - the method and practice of teaching. This paper introduces The Pedagogy Benchmark, a novel dataset designed to evaluate large language models on their Cross-Domain Pedagogical Knowledge (CDPK) and Special Education Needs and Disability (SEND) pedagogical knowledge. These benchmarks are built on a carefully curated set of questions sourced from professional development exams for teachers, which cover a range of pedagogical subdomains such as teaching strategies and assessment methods. Here we outline the methodology and development of these benchmarks. We report results for 97 models, with accuracies spanning a range from 28% to 89% on the pedagogical knowledge questions. We consider the relationship between cost and accuracy and chart the progression of the Pareto value frontier over time. We provide online leaderboards at https://rebrand.ly/pedagogy which are updated with new models and allow interactive exploration and filtering based on various model properties, such as cost per token and open-vs-closed weights, as well as looking at performance in different subjects. LLMs and generative AI have tremendous potential to influence education and help to address the global learning crisis. Education-focused benchmarks are crucial to measure models' capacities to understand pedagogical concepts, respond appropriately to learners' needs, and support effective teaching practices across diverse contexts. They are needed for informing the responsible and evidence-based deployment of LLMs and LLM-based tools in educational settings, and for guiding both development and policy decisions.

Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{StorySim}$, a programmable framework for synthetically generating stories to evaluate the theory of mind (ToM) and world modeling (WM) capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior benchmarks that may suffer from contamination in pretraining data, $\texttt{StorySim}$ produces novel, compositional story prompts anchored by a highly controllable $\texttt{Storyboard}$, enabling precise manipulation of character perspectives and events. We use this framework to design first- and second-order ToM tasks alongside WM tasks that control for the ability to track and model mental states. Our experiments across a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that most models perform better on WM tasks than ToM tasks, and that models tend to perform better reasoning with humans compared to inanimate objects. Additionally, our framework enabled us to find evidence of heuristic behavior such as recency bias and an over-reliance on earlier events in the story. All code for generating data and evaluations is freely available.

Abstract: While multi-vehicular collaborative driving demonstrates clear advantages over single-vehicle autonomy, traditional infrastructure-based V2X systems remain constrained by substantial deployment costs and the creation of "uncovered danger zones" in rural and suburban areas. We present AirV2X-Perception, a large-scale dataset that leverages Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as a flexible alternative or complement to fixed Road-Side Units (RSUs). Drones offer unique advantages over ground-based perception: complementary bird's-eye-views that reduce occlusions, dynamic positioning capabilities that enable hovering, patrolling, and escorting navigation rules, and significantly lower deployment costs compared to fixed infrastructure. Our dataset comprises 6.73 hours of drone-assisted driving scenarios across urban, suburban, and rural environments with varied weather and lighting conditions. The AirV2X-Perception dataset facilitates the development and standardized evaluation of Vehicle-to-Drone (V2D) algorithms, addressing a critical gap in the rapidly expanding field of aerial-assisted autonomous driving systems. The dataset and development kits are open-sourced at https://github.com/taco-group/AirV2X-Perception.

Abstract: Our quality audit for three widely used public multilingual speech datasets - Mozilla Common Voice 17.0, FLEURS, and Vox Populi - shows that in some languages, these datasets suffer from significant quality issues, which may obfuscate downstream evaluation results while creating an illusion of success. We divide these quality issues into two categories: micro-level and macro-level. We find that macro-level issues are more prevalent in less institutionalized, often under-resourced languages. We provide a case analysis of Taiwanese Southern Min (nan_tw) that highlights the need for proactive language planning (e.g. orthography prescriptions, dialect boundary definition) and enhanced data quality control in the dataset creation process. We conclude by proposing guidelines and recommendations to mitigate these issues in future dataset development, emphasizing the importance of sociolinguistic awareness and language planning principles. Furthermore, we encourage research into how this creation process itself can be leveraged as a tool for community-led language planning and revitalization.

<div> multi-turn interactive thinking, deep reasoning, large language model, logical coherence, contextual consistency
Summary:
KAG-Thinker introduces a multi-turn interactive thinking and deep reasoning framework using a parameter-light large language model (LLM). The framework decomposes complex questions into solvable sub-problems and classifies them as Knowledge Retrieval or Reasoning Analysis tasks. It optimizes knowledge retrieval from LLMs and external sources using confidence calibration and reflective reasoning. The structured thinking process enhances logical coherence and contextual consistency in question-answering tasks on knowledge bases. Retrieval, Math, and Deduce functions handle retrieval and reasoning tasks, with explicit modeling of dependencies and parameter passing. The framework leverages logical function interfaces for task classification and knowledge acquisition through the depth solving module. The knowledge boundary module identifies the optimal knowledge source for retrieval tasks, ensuring comprehensive knowledge acquisition. <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce KAG-Thinker, which upgrade KAG to a multi-turn interactive thinking and deep reasoning framework powered by a dedicated parameter-light large language model (LLM). Our approach constructs a structured thinking process for solving complex problems, enhancing the the logical coherence and contextual consistency of the reasoning process in question-answering (Q&amp;A) tasks on domain-specific knowledge bases (KBs) within LLMs. Following the \textbf{Logical Form} guided retrieval and reasoning technology route of KAG, this framework first decomposes complex questions into independently solvable sub-problems (which are also referred to as logical forms) through \textbf{breadth decomposition}. Each such logical form is represented in two equivalent forms-natural language and logical function-and subsequently classified as either a Knowledge Retrieval or Reasoning Analysis task. Dependencies and parameter passing between these tasks are explicitly modeled via logical function interfaces. In the solving process, the Retrieval function performs retrieval tasks. It retrieves one-hop structured and unstructured information of specified knowledge unit. While the Math and Deduce functions are used to perform reasoning analysis tasks. Secondly, it is worth noting that, in the Knowledge Retrieval sub-problem tasks, LLMs and external knowledge sources are regarded as equivalent KBs. We use the \textbf{knowledge boundary} module to determine the optimal source using self-regulatory mechanisms such as confidence calibration and reflective reasoning, and use the \textbf{depth solving} module to enhance the comprehensiveness of knowledge acquisition...

<div> Keywords: vision-language models, visual question answering, interpretability, cross-modal reasoning, explainable AI<br />
Summary: <br />
The article discusses the challenges in interpreting the visual attention of large vision-language models (LVLMs) during visual question answering tasks. To address this issue, the authors propose a framework called GLIMPSE that attributes LVLM outputs to relevant visual evidence and textual signals. GLIMPSE combines gradient-weighted attention, adaptive layer propagation, and relevance-weighted token aggregation to generate response-level heat maps for cross-modal reasoning interpretation. The framework outperforms existing methods in interpretability and enhances human-alignment accuracy. Through GLIMPSE, researchers can gain insights into LVLM cross-modal attribution, trace reasoning processes, analyze human-attention misalignment, detect hallucinations, uncover biases, and promote transparency. This analytic explainable AI (XAI) approach provides a comprehensive understanding of LVLM behavior and ensures the reliability and fairness of AI systems. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Recent progress in large vision-language models (LVLMs) has advanced the state of the art in visual question answering (VQA). However, interpreting where LVLMs direct their visual attention while generating free-form responses remains a significant challenge, yet is essential for understanding model behavior. We introduce GLIMPSE (Gradient-Layer Importance Mapping for Prompted Visual Saliency Explanation), a lightweight, model-agnostic framework that jointly attributes LVLM outputs to the most relevant visual evidence and textual signals supporting open-ended VQA. GLIMPSE fuses gradient-weighted attention, adaptive layer propagation, and relevance-weighted token aggregation to produce holistic response-level heat maps for interpreting cross-modal reasoning, outperforming prior interpretability methods and pushing the state-of-the-art in human-alignment. We demonstrate an analytic explainable AI (XAI) approach using GLIMPSE to uncover fine-grained insights into LVLM cross-modal attribution, trace reasoning dynamics, analyze systematic human-attention misalignment, diagnose hallucination, expose bias, and ensure transparency.

Abstract: With the proliferation of large language model (LLM) applications since 2022, their use in education has sparked both excitement and concern. Recent studies consistently highlight students' (mis)use of LLMs can hinder learning outcomes. This work aims to teach students how to effectively prompt LLMs to improve their learning. We first proposed pedagogical prompting, a theoretically-grounded new concept to elicit learning-oriented responses from LLMs. To move from concept design to a proof-of-concept learning intervention in real educational settings, we selected early undergraduate CS education (CS1/CS2) as the example context. We began with a formative survey study with instructors (N=36) teaching early-stage undergraduate-level CS courses to inform the instructional design based on classroom needs. Based on their insights, we designed and developed a learning intervention through an interactive system with scenario-based instruction to train pedagogical prompting skills. Finally, we evaluated its instructional effectiveness through a user study with CS novice students (N=22) using pre/post-tests. Through mixed methods analyses, our results indicate significant improvements in learners' LLM-based pedagogical help-seeking skills, along with positive attitudes toward the system and increased willingness to use pedagogical prompts in the future. Our contributions include (1) a theoretical framework of pedagogical prompting; (2) empirical insights into current instructor attitudes toward pedagogical prompting; and (3) a learning intervention design with an interactive learning tool and scenario-based instruction leading to promising results on teaching LLM-based help-seeking. Our approach is scalable for broader implementation in classrooms and has the potential to be integrated into tools like ChatGPT as an on-boarding experience to encourage learning-oriented use of generative AI.

This paper explores the combination of natural language programming and drag-and-drop interfaces for specifying tasks for robots. By using a large language model (LLM) pipeline, the system accepts natural language input and generates human-like action sequences at a detailed level. The study compares the generated action sequences to hand-specified ones and found that larger models tend to outperform smaller ones in producing human-like actions. However, even smaller models can achieve satisfactory performance. This research demonstrates the potential for combining intuitive natural language communication with precise drag-and-drop interfaces in robot programming, offering accessible means for end-users to specify tasks effectively. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.22604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robot end users increasingly require accessible means of specifying tasks for robots to perform. Two common end-user programming paradigms include drag-and-drop interfaces and natural language programming. Although natural language interfaces harness an intuitive form of human communication, drag-and-drop interfaces enable users to meticulously and precisely dictate the key actions of the robot's task. In this paper, we investigate the degree to which both approaches can be combined. Specifically, we construct a large language model (LLM)-based pipeline that accepts natural language as input and produces human-like action sequences as output, specified at a level of granularity that a human would produce. We then compare these generated action sequences to another dataset of hand-specified action sequences. Although our results reveal that larger models tend to outperform smaller ones in the production of human-like action sequences, smaller models nonetheless achieve satisfactory performance.

Abstract: Games have long been used as benchmarks and testing environments for research in artificial intelligence. A key step in supporting this research was the development of game description languages: frameworks that compile domain-specific code into playable and simulatable game environments, allowing researchers to generalize their algorithms and approaches across multiple games without having to manually implement each one. More recently, progress in reinforcement learning (RL) has been largely driven by advances in hardware acceleration. Libraries like JAX allow practitioners to take full advantage of cutting-edge computing hardware, often speeding up training and testing by orders of magnitude. Here, we present a synthesis of these strands of research: a domain-specific language for board games which automatically compiles into hardware-accelerated code. Our framework, Ludax, combines the generality of game description languages with the speed of modern parallel processing hardware and is designed to fit neatly into existing deep learning pipelines. We envision Ludax as a tool to help accelerate games research generally, from RL to cognitive science, by enabling rapid simulation and providing a flexible representation scheme. We present a detailed breakdown of Ludax's description language and technical notes on the compilation process, along with speed benchmarking and a demonstration of training RL agents. The Ludax framework, along with implementations of existing board games, is open-source and freely available.

<div> Keywords: explainable machine learning, statistical decision theory, clinical decision support, model evaluation, expected explanation use

Summary: 
This paper emphasizes the importance of designing and evaluating explanations in machine learning with a specific end goal in mind rather than just describing how models work. By using a framework based on statistical decision theory, the authors aim to prevent misuse of explanations and provide a boost in performance for decision-makers in various use cases such as clinical decision support and debugging. They propose a functionally-grounded approach that forces researchers to specify concrete use cases for evaluation, combining theoretical and empirical perspectives to analyze the value of explanations. The paper introduces definitions that bridge these perspectives and demonstrates how this approach can help quantify the maximum improvement in performance that explanations can offer to decision-makers. <div>
arXiv:2506.22740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern methods for explainable machine learning are designed to describe how models map inputs to outputs--without deep consideration of how these explanations will be used in practice. This paper argues that explanations should be designed and evaluated with a specific end in mind. We describe how to formalize this end in a framework based in statistical decision theory. We show how this functionally-grounded approach can be applied across diverse use cases, such as clinical decision support, providing recourse, or debugging. We demonstrate its use to characterize the maximum "boost" in performance on a particular task that an explanation could provide an idealized decision-maker, preventing misuse due to ambiguity by forcing researchers to specify concrete use cases that can be analyzed in light of models of expected explanation use. We argue that evaluation should meld theoretical and empirical perspectives on the value of explanation, and contribute definitions that span these perspectives.

<div> Keywords: Artificial Intelligence, Trustworthy AI, ethics, algorithmic processes, assessment method 

Summary: 
The paper discusses the challenges and impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology on society, emphasizing the need to address its potential negative consequences. It highlights the complexity and widespread integration of AI systems, leading to a reliance on technologies beyond human oversight. While existing guidelines offer a holistic view of Trustworthy AI, they lack quantification techniques. On the other hand, technological tools focus on specific aspects and lack a holistic perspective. The paper proposes an assessment method that combines ethical components with algorithmic processes like PageRank and TrustRank to quantify trustworthiness objectively. By integrating algorithmic criteria, the approach strives to minimize subjectivity in self-assessment techniques prevalent in the field. This method demonstrates that a holistic assessment of an AI system's trustworthiness can be achieved by providing quantitative insights while considering relevant ethical guidelines.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology epitomizes the complex challenges posed by human-made artifacts, particularly those widely integrated into society and exert significant influence, highlighting potential benefits and their negative consequences. While other technologies may also pose substantial risks, AI's pervasive reach makes its societal effects especially profound. The complexity of AI systems, coupled with their remarkable capabilities, can lead to a reliance on technologies that operate beyond direct human oversight or understanding. To mitigate the risks that arise, several theoretical tools and guidelines have been developed, alongside efforts to create technological tools aimed at safeguarding Trustworthy AI. The guidelines take a more holistic view of the issue but fail to provide techniques for quantifying trustworthiness. Conversely, while technological tools are better at achieving such quantification, they lack a holistic perspective, focusing instead on specific aspects of Trustworthy AI. This paper aims to introduce an assessment method that combines the ethical components of Trustworthy AI with the algorithmic processes of PageRank and TrustRank. The goal is to establish an assessment framework that minimizes the subjectivity inherent in the self-assessment techniques prevalent in the field by introducing algorithmic criteria. The application of our approach indicates that a holistic assessment of an AI system's trustworthiness can be achieved by providing quantitative insights while considering the theoretical content of relevant guidelines.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revealed a significant performance gap between closed-source and open-source models, particularly in tasks requiring complex reasoning and precise instruction following. This paper introduces ReasonBridge, a methodology that efficiently transfers reasoning capabilities from powerful closed-source to open-source models through a novel hierarchical knowledge distillation framework. We develop a tailored dataset Reason1K with only 1,000 carefully curated reasoning traces emphasizing difficulty, diversity, and quality. These traces are filtered from across multiple domains using a structured multi-criteria selection algorithm. Our transfer learning approach incorporates: (1) a hierarchical distillation process capturing both strategic abstraction and tactical implementation patterns, (2) a sparse reasoning-focused adapter architecture requiring only 0.3% additional trainable parameters, and (3) a test-time compute scaling mechanism using guided inference interventions. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that ReasonBridge improves reasoning capabilities in open-source models by up to 23% on benchmark tasks, significantly narrowing the gap with closed-source models. Notably, the enhanced Qwen2.5-14B outperforms Claude-Sonnet3.5 on MATH500 and matches its performance on competition-level AIME problems. Our methodology generalizes effectively across diverse reasoning domains and model architectures, establishing a sample-efficient approach to reasoning enhancement for instruction following.

Summary: 
Hecto introduces a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with architectural heterogeneity, combining a GRU expert for temporal reasoning and an FFNN expert for static abstraction under a sparse Top-1 gating mechanism. The model performs well on multiple benchmarks such as AG News, SST-2, HotpotQA, and STS-B, showing specialized expert alignment to distinct reasoning types. Despite receiving isolated input representations, Hecto matches or closely trails homogeneous baselines in performance. It exhibits improved performance at larger batch sizes due to relaxed computational constraints, allowing its heterogeneous architecture to optimize effectively. Ablation results confirm that architectural diversity is crucial for Hecto's stability and interpretability across diverse reasoning tasks. Hecto serves as a benchmark for conditional computation, offering a principled framework for specialized reasoning in low-resource settings, emphasizing model strength derived from principled specialization.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable conditional computation by routing inputs to specialized experts, but these experts rely on identical inductive biases, thus limiting representational diversity. This static computation pathway is inefficient for inputs that require different types of reasoning and limits specialization and interpretability. We propose Hecto, a lightweight MoE architecture that leverages architectural heterogeneity by combining a GRU expert for temporal reasoning and an FFNN expert for static abstraction under a sparse Top-1 gating mechanism. Evaluated on three reasoning benchmarks (AG News, SST-2, HotpotQA) and a regression task (STS-B), Hecto matches or closely trails homogeneous baselines in performance despite receiving isolated input representations, while achieving clear expert specialization, with each expert aligning to distinct reasoning types (temporal vs static). At larger batch sizes, Hecto exhibits improved performance, benefiting from relaxed computational constraints that allow its heterogeneous architecture to optimize more effectively. Ablation results isolate architectural diversity as the source of Hecto's stability and interpretability across diverse reasoning tasks. Overall, Hecto establishes itself as a new benchmark for conditional computation, offering a principled framework for specialized reasoning in low-resource regimes with its model strength derived from principled specialization.

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning abilities in tasks like math and coding but lack true comprehension of their reasoning processes. This paper proposes using self-play through a Critic-Discernment Game (CDG) to enhance model rationality in reasoning without human supervision. In the CDG, a prover offers a solution to a problem and faces critiques that can aid or mislead. The prover's objective is to maintain correct answers in the face of misleading feedback and correct errors based on constructive criticism. Experiments on tasks involving mathematical reasoning, error detection, self-correction, and long-chain reasoning show that CDG training significantly improves LLMs' ability to understand their reasoning processes. This approach could advance the capabilities of AI models to reason and comprehend complex problems autonomously. 

<br /><br />Summary: Large language models have strong reasoning abilities but lack comprehension of their processes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable reasoning abilities in various tasks such as mathematics and coding. However, recent studies indicate that even the best models lack true comprehension of their reasoning processes. In this paper, we explore how self-play can enhance the rationality of models in the reasoning process without supervision from humans or superior models. We design a Critic-Discernment Game(CDG) in which a prover first provides a solution to a given problem and is subsequently challenged by critiques of its solution. These critiques either aim to assist or mislead the prover. The objective of the prover is to maintain the correct answer when faced with misleading comments, while correcting errors in response to constructive feedback. Our experiments on tasks involving mathematical reasoning, stepwise error detection, self-correction, and long-chain reasoning demonstrate that CDG training can significantly improve the ability of well-aligned LLMs to comprehend their reasoning process.

<div> complex reasoning, multimodal language models, MARBLE, multistep plans, perception<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces MARBLE, a challenging benchmark for evaluating multimodal language models' ability to reason step-by-step through complex problems. The benchmark includes tasks like M-Portal and M-Cube that require crafting and understanding multistep plans under various constraints. Current multimodal language models exhibit poor performance on MARBLE, with most models achieving near-random accuracy. The study highlights that complex reasoning remains a challenge for existing models, indicating the need for advancements in multimodal language processing. Perception is identified as a bottleneck, as models struggle to extract information from visual inputs effectively. The article aims to inspire the development of next-generation models capable of advanced reasoning and planning across multiple modalities. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.22992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to process information from multiple modalities and to reason through it step-by-step remains a critical challenge in advancing artificial intelligence. However, existing reasoning benchmarks focus on text-only reasoning, or employ multimodal questions that can be answered by directly retrieving information from a non-text modality. Thus, complex reasoning remains poorly understood in multimodal domains. Here, we present MARBLE, a challenging multimodal reasoning benchmark that is designed to scrutinize multimodal language models (MLLMs) in their ability to carefully reason step-by-step through complex multimodal problems and environments. MARBLE is composed of two highly challenging tasks, M-Portal and M-Cube, that require the crafting and understanding of multistep plans under spatial, visual, and physical constraints. We find that current MLLMs perform poorly on MARBLE -- all the 12 advanced models obtain near-random performance on M-Portal and 0% accuracy on M-Cube. Only in simplified subtasks some models outperform the random baseline, indicating that complex reasoning is still a challenge for existing MLLMs. Moreover, we show that perception remains a bottleneck, where MLLMs occasionally fail to extract information from the visual inputs. By shedding a light on the limitations of MLLMs, we hope that MARBLE will spur the development of the next generation of models with the ability to reason and plan across many, multimodal reasoning steps.

<div> Keywords: Evolutionary Framework, Geometry of Cognition, Metalinguistic Moment, Mathematical Symbolism Moment, Formal Logic System Moment

Summary:
The paper presents a five-stage evolutionary framework for understanding the development of artificial intelligence, comparing it to historical human cognitive technologies. It argues that AI is advancing through distinct epochs, with each epoch marked by a revolutionary shift in its representation and reasoning capabilities. The "Geometry of Cognition" framework explains past architectural shifts in AI and provides a path forward. The evolution of AI is viewed as reflexive, reshaping its own architecture as it progresses through stages. The current "Metalinguistic Moment" involves self-reflective capabilities, leading to future stages such as the "Mathematical Symbolism Moment" and the "Formal Logic System Moment." These stages will focus on developing a computable calculus of thought and creating provably aligned and reliable AI. The paper offers a methodological foundation for future research and provides strategies for startups and developers looking to build intelligent systems.

arXiv:2506.23080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive five-stage evolutionary framework for understanding the development of artificial intelligence, arguing that its trajectory mirrors the historical progression of human cognitive technologies. We posit that AI is advancing through distinct epochs, each defined by a revolutionary shift in its capacity for representation and reasoning, analogous to the inventions of cuneiform, the alphabet, grammar and logic, mathematical calculus, and formal logical systems. This "Geometry of Cognition" framework moves beyond mere metaphor to provide a systematic, cross-disciplinary model that not only explains AI's past architectural shifts-from expert systems to Transformers-but also charts a concrete and prescriptive path forward. Crucially, we demonstrate that this evolution is not merely linear but reflexive: as AI advances through these stages, the tools and insights it develops create a feedback loop that fundamentally reshapes its own underlying architecture. We are currently transitioning into a "Metalinguistic Moment," characterized by the emergence of self-reflective capabilities like Chain-of-Thought prompting and Constitutional AI. The subsequent stages, the "Mathematical Symbolism Moment" and the "Formal Logic System Moment," will be defined by the development of a computable calculus of thought, likely through neuro-symbolic architectures and program synthesis, culminating in provably aligned and reliable AI that reconstructs its own foundational representations. This work serves as the methodological capstone to our trilogy, which previously explored the economic drivers ("why") and cognitive nature ("what") of AI. Here, we address the "how," providing a theoretical foundation for future research and offering concrete, actionable strategies for startups and developers aiming to build the next generation of intelligent systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides, extending their applications to dialogue systems, automated content creation, and domain-specific advisory tasks. However, as their use grows, concerns have emerged regarding their reliability in simulating complex decision-making behavior, such as risky decision-making, where a single choice can lead to multiple outcomes. This study investigates the ability of LLMs to simulate risky decision-making scenarios. We compare model-generated decisions with actual human responses in a series of lottery-based tasks, using transportation stated preference survey data from participants in Sydney, Dhaka, Hong Kong, and Nanjing. Demographic inputs were provided to two LLMs -- ChatGPT 4o and ChatGPT o1-mini -- which were tasked with predicting individual choices. Risk preferences were analyzed using the Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) framework. Results show that both models exhibit more risk-averse behavior than human participants, with o1-mini aligning more closely with observed human decisions. Further analysis of multilingual data from Nanjing and Hong Kong indicates that model predictions in Chinese deviate more from actual responses compared to English, suggesting that prompt language may influence simulation performance. These findings highlight both the promise and the current limitations of LLMs in replicating human-like risk behavior, particularly in linguistic and cultural settings.

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) like DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-V3, and GPT-4o were evaluated for their relational reasoning capabilities through benchmark tasks. DeepSeek-R1 showed the highest F1-scores across tasks, indicating proficiency in logical deduction and relational inference. However, all models, including DeepSeek-R1, struggled with complex problems due to token length limitations and incomplete output structures. DeepSeek-R1's longer Chain-of-Thought responses revealed unique planning and verification strategies but also inconsistencies in reasoning. There is a need for further analysis of LLMs' internal inference dynamics to improve reasoning abilities. Future work should focus on multimodal reasoning and systematic examination of reasoning failures. The study provides empirical insights and theoretical implications for enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities, especially in tasks requiring structured, multi-step logical inference.

<br /><br />Summary: Large Language Models were evaluated for relational reasoning, with DeepSeek-R1 outperforming others. However, all models faced challenges in complex problems due to limitations in token length and output structures. DeepSeek-R1's unique planning and verification strategies were highlighted, but inconsistencies in reasoning were noted, calling for deeper scrutiny. Future research should explore multimodal reasoning and analyze reasoning failures systematically to improve LLMs' relational reasoning abilities. <div>

Abstract: How far are Large Language Models (LLMs) in performing deep relational reasoning? In this paper, we evaluate and compare the reasoning capabilities of three cutting-edge LLMs, namely, DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o, through a suite of carefully designed benchmark tasks in family tree and general graph reasoning. Our experiments reveal that DeepSeek-R1 consistently achieves the highest F1-scores across multiple tasks and problem sizes, demonstrating strong aptitude in logical deduction and relational inference. However, all evaluated models, including DeepSeek-R1, struggle significantly as problem complexity increases, largely due to token length limitations and incomplete output structures. A detailed analysis of DeepSeek-R1's long Chain-of-Thought responses uncovers its unique planning and verification strategies, but also highlights instances of incoherent or incomplete reasoning, calling attention to the need for deeper scrutiny into LLMs' internal inference dynamics. We further discuss key directions for future work, including the role of multimodal reasoning and the systematic examination of reasoning failures. Our findings provide both empirical insights and theoretical implications for advancing LLMs' reasoning abilities, particularly in tasks that demand structured, multi-step logical inference.

Summary:
- The article proposes a semantic-aware relational message passing framework for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC).
- Traditional node-based message passing mechanisms in knowledge graphs tend to introduce noise and suffer from information dilution or over-smoothing.
- The framework introduces a semantic-aware Top-K neighbor selection strategy to select only the most relevant edges for information aggregation.
- Information from the selected edges is fused with the central node's representation using a multi-head attention aggregator to generate a semantically focused node message.
- The model effectively captures and propagates contextual information most relevant to the link prediction task, improving performance on established benchmarks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.23141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic context surrounding a triplet $(h, r, t)$ is crucial for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), providing vital cues for prediction. However, traditional node-based message passing mechanisms, when applied to knowledge graphs, often introduce noise and suffer from information dilution or over-smoothing by indiscriminately aggregating information from all neighboring edges. To address this challenge, we propose a semantic-aware relational message passing. A core innovation of this framework is the introduction of a \textbf{semantic-aware Top-K neighbor selection strategy}. Specifically, this strategy first evaluates the semantic relevance between a central node and its incident edges within a shared latent space, selecting only the Top-K most pertinent ones. Subsequently, information from these selected edges is effectively fused with the central node's own representation using a \textbf{multi-head attention aggregator} to generate a semantically focused node message. In this manner, our model not only leverages the structure and features of edges within the knowledge graph but also more accurately captures and propagates the contextual information most relevant to the specific link prediction task, thereby effectively mitigating interference from irrelevant information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing approaches on several established benchmarks.

Summary: 
In the paper, the concept of rises in concept lattices is introduced to measure distributivity, a well-studied notion in lattice theory. Rises assess changes in covering concepts within a lattice and determine distributivity based on the presence of non-unit rises. The study establishes that a lattice is distributive if non-unit rises are absent, connecting rises to meet- and join distributivity. Analysis of real-world data shows high join distributivity but lower meet distributivity in concept lattices. The manifestation of join distributivity on ordered sets is also explored, highlighting the relationship between distributivity and lattice structures. <div>
arXiv:2506.23168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributivity is a well-established and extensively studied notion in lattice theory. In the context of data analysis, particularly within Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), lattices are often observed to exhibit a high degree of distributivity. However, no standardized measure exists to quantify this property. In this paper, we introduce the notion of rises in (concept) lattices as a means to assess distributivity. Rises capture how the number of attributes or objects in covering concepts change within the concept lattice. We show that a lattice is distributive if and only if no non-unit rises occur. Furthermore, we relate rises to the classical notion of meet- and join distributivity. We observe that concept lattices from real-world data are to a high degree join-distributive, but much less meet-distributive. We additionally study how join-distributivity manifests on the level of ordered sets.

Abstract: Despite the advancements of large language models, text2sql still faces many challenges, particularly with complex and domain-specific queries. In finance, database designs and financial reporting layouts vary widely between financial entities and countries, making text2sql even more challenging. We present FinStat2SQL, a lightweight text2sql pipeline enabling natural language queries over financial statements. Tailored to local standards like VAS, it combines large and small language models in a multi-agent setup for entity extraction, SQL generation, and self-correction. We build a domain-specific database and evaluate models on a synthetic QA dataset. A fine-tuned 7B model achieves 61.33\% accuracy with sub-4-second response times on consumer hardware, outperforming GPT-4o-mini. FinStat2SQL offers a scalable, cost-efficient solution for financial analysis, making AI-powered querying accessible to Vietnamese enterprises.

<div> cooperation, large language models, social dilemmas, costly sanctioning, behavioral patterns

Summary: 
The study focuses on how large language models (LLMs) navigate social dilemmas, specifically the challenge of costly sanctioning in multi-agent systems. By adapting a public goods game, different behavioral patterns among LLMs are observed: some consistently cooperate, some fluctuate, some decline over time, and some rigidly follow fixed strategies. Interestingly, reasoning LLMs struggle with cooperation, while traditional LLMs consistently achieve high levels of cooperation. These findings suggest that enhancing reasoning capabilities in LLMs may not necessarily lead to cooperation. Insights from this study are valuable for deploying LLM agents in environments that require sustained collaboration. The code for the study is available on GitHub for reference.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents, understanding their cooperation and social mechanisms is becoming increasingly important. In particular, how LLMs balance self-interest and collective well-being is a critical challenge for ensuring alignment, robustness, and safe deployment. In this paper, we examine the challenge of costly sanctioning in multi-agent LLM systems, where an agent must decide whether to invest its own resources to incentivize cooperation or penalize defection. To study this, we adapt a public goods game with institutional choice from behavioral economics, allowing us to observe how different LLMs navigate social dilemmas over repeated interactions. Our analysis reveals four distinct behavioral patterns among models: some consistently establish and sustain high levels of cooperation, others fluctuate between engagement and disengagement, some gradually decline in cooperative behavior over time, and others rigidly follow fixed strategies regardless of outcomes. Surprisingly, we find that reasoning LLMs, such as the o1 series, struggle significantly with cooperation, whereas some traditional LLMs consistently achieve high levels of cooperation. These findings suggest that the current approach to improving LLMs, which focuses on enhancing their reasoning capabilities, does not necessarily lead to cooperation, providing valuable insights for deploying LLM agents in environments that require sustained collaboration.

Summary: 
GATSim (Generative-Agent Transport Simulation) is a new framework that utilizes recent advancements in AI technology to create generative agents with rich behavioral characteristics for urban mobility simulation. These agents have diverse socioeconomic attributes, individual lifestyles, and evolving preferences that influence their mobility decisions. The framework combines an urban mobility foundation model with agent cognitive systems and a transport simulation environment. The implementation includes psychologically-informed memory systems, tool usage capabilities, and lifelong learning mechanisms for the agents. Experiments demonstrated that generative agents can produce believable travel behaviors and realistic traffic evolution patterns. The prototype system code is open source and available on GitHub at https://github.com/qiliuchn/gatsim.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.23306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional agent-based urban mobility simulations rely on rigid rule-based systems that fail to capture the complexity, adaptability, and behavioral diversity characteristic of human travel decision-making. Recent advances in large language models and AI agent technology offer opportunities to create agents with reasoning capabilities, persistent memory, and adaptive learning mechanisms. We propose GATSim (Generative-Agent Transport Simulation), a novel framework that leverages these advances to create generative agents with rich behavioral characteristics for urban mobility simulation. Unlike conventional approaches, GATSim agents possess diverse socioeconomic attributes, individual lifestyles, and evolving preferences that shape their mobility decisions through psychologically-informed memory systems, tool usage capabilities, and lifelong learning mechanisms. The main contributions of this study include: (1) a comprehensive architecture combining an urban mobility foundation model with agent cognitive systems and transport simulation environment, (2) a fully functional prototype implementation, and (3) systematic validation demonstrating that generative agents produce believable travel behaviors. Through designed reflection processes, generative agents in this study can transform specific travel experiences into generalized insights, enabling realistic behavioral adaptation over time with specialized mechanisms for activity planning and real-time reactive behaviors tailored to urban mobility contexts. Experiments show that generative agents perform competitively with human annotators in mobility scenarios while naturally producing macroscopic traffic evolution patterns. The code for the prototype system is shared at https://github.com/qiliuchn/gatsim.

Summary:
The paper introduces HonestVQA, a self-supervised honesty calibration framework for Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) systems. It aims to align model confidence with actual correctness, quantify uncertainty, and enforce ethical response behavior. The framework includes weighted loss functions and contrastive learning to improve accuracy and reduce overconfidence. Two evaluation metrics, Honesty Score (H-Score) and Ethical Confidence Index (ECI), are introduced to benchmark alignment between confidence, accuracy, and ethical communication. Empirical results show that HonestVQA improves DocVQA accuracy and F1 score across different datasets. It reduces overconfidence and demonstrates strong generalization in cross-domain evaluation. Ablation results highlight the importance of alignment and contrastive loss in maintaining accuracy.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.23464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) systems are increasingly deployed in real world applications, yet they remain ethically opaque-often producing overconfident answers to ambiguous questions or failing to communicate uncertainty in a trustworthy manner. This misalignment between model confidence and actual knowledge poses significant risks, particularly in domains requiring ethical accountability. Existing approaches such as LayoutLMv3, UDOP, and DONUT have advanced SOTA performance by focusing on architectural sophistication and accuracy; however, they fall short in ethical responsiveness.
  To address these limitations, we introduce HonestVQA, a self-supervised honesty calibration framework for ethically aligned DocVQA. Our model-agnostic method quantifies uncertainty to identify knowledge gaps, aligns model confidence with actual correctness using weighted loss functions, and enforces ethical response behavior via contrastive learning. We further introduce two principled evaluation metrics--Honesty Score (H-Score) and Ethical Confidence Index (ECI)--to benchmark alignment between confidence, accuracy, and ethical communication. Empirically, HonestVQA improves DocVQA accuracy by up to 4.3% and F1 by 4.3% across SpDocVQA, InfographicsVQA, and SROIE datasets. It reduces overconfidence, lowering H-Score and ECI by 0.072 and 0.078, respectively. In cross domain evaluation, it achieves up to 78.9% accuracy and 76.1% F1-score, demonstrating strong generalization. Ablation shows a 3.8% drop in accuracy without alignment or contrastive loss.

arXiv:2506.23503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a proven approach for addressing the irrational thought patterns associated with mental health disorders, but its effectiveness relies on accurately identifying cognitive pathways to provide targeted treatment. In today's digital age, individuals often express negative emotions on social media, where they may reveal cognitive distortions, and in severe cases, exhibit suicidal tendencies. However, there is a significant gap in methodologies designed to analyze these cognitive pathways, which could be critical for psychotherapists aiming to deliver timely and effective interventions in online environments. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) framework leveraging acceptance, commitment and data augmentation to categorize and address both textual and visual content as positive or negative. Specifically, the system employs BERT, RoBERTa for Sentiment Analysis and T5, PEGASUS for Text Summarization, mT5 for Text Translation in Multiple Languages focusing on detecting negative emotions and cognitive distortions within social media data. While existing models are primarily designed to identify negative thoughts, the proposed system goes beyond this by predicting additional negative side effects and other potential mental health disorders likes Phobias, Eating Disorders. This enhancement allows for a more comprehensive understanding and intervention strategy, offering psychotherapists a powerful tool for early detection and treatment of various psychological issues.

Summary: 
This study introduces a new hybrid model combining AlexNet and LSTM algorithms for more accurate electricity price forecasting. Traditional methods often fail to accurately predict prices due to a lack of consideration for external variables. By incorporating features such as demand, temperature, sunlight, and rain, the hybrid model improves prediction accuracy. Through methods like minimum-maximum scaling and time windowing, the model predicts future electricity prices based on past data. Results show the hybrid model outperforms standalone models RNN and ANN, achieving an accuracy rating of 97.08 compared to 96.64 and 96.63, respectively. The combination of AlexNet's feature extraction and LSTM's sequential pattern learning significantly enhances the forecasting capabilities of the model. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The recent development of advanced machine learning methods for hybrid models has greatly addressed the need for the correct prediction of electrical prices. This method combines AlexNet and LSTM algorithms, which are used to introduce a new model with higher accuracy in price forecasting. Despite RNN and ANN being effective, they often fail to deal with forex time sequence data. The traditional methods do not accurately forecast the prices. These traditional methods only focus on demand and price which leads to insufficient analysis of data. To address this issue, using the hybrid approach, which focuses on external variables that also effect the predicted prices. Nevertheless, due to AlexNet's excellent feature extraction and LSTM's learning sequential patterns, the prediction accuracy is vastly increased. The model is built on the past data, which has been supplied with the most significant elements like demand, temperature, sunlight, and rain. For example, the model applies methods, such as minimum-maximum scaling and a time window, to predict the electricity prices of the future. The results show that this hybrid model is good than the standalone ones in terms of accuracy. Although we got our accuracy rating of 97.08, it shows higher accompaniments than remaining models RNN and ANN with accuracies of 96.64 and 96.63 respectively.

Summary:
GPTZero, a commonly used AI detector, was tested for its accuracy in identifying AI-generated texts of varying lengths. The study included short, medium, and long essays, both AI-generated and human-written. Results showed GPTZero successfully detected AI content with high accuracy, but had limitations in distinguishing human-authored texts, leading to some false positives. Educators are advised to be cautious when relying solely on AI detection tools for detecting AI-generated content in student submissions. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.23517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the use of AI tools by students has become more prevalent, instructors have started using AI detection tools like GPTZero and QuillBot to detect AI written text. However, the reliability of these detectors remains uncertain. In our study, we focused mostly on the success rate of GPTZero, the most-used AI detector, in identifying AI-generated texts based on different lengths of randomly submitted essays: short (40-100 word count), medium (100-350 word count), and long (350-800 word count). We gathered a data set consisting of twenty-eight AI-generated papers and fifty human-written papers. With this randomized essay data, papers were individually plugged into GPTZero and measured for percentage of AI generation and confidence. A vast majority of the AI-generated papers were detected accurately (ranging from 91-100% AI believed generation), while the human generated essays fluctuated; there were a handful of false positives. These findings suggest that although GPTZero is effective at detecting purely AI-generated content, its reliability in distinguishing human-authored texts is limited. Educators should therefore exercise caution when relying solely on AI detection tools.

Abstract: With the increasing interest in robotic synthesis in the context of organic chemistry, the automated extraction of chemical procedures from literature is critical. However, this task remains challenging due to the inherent ambiguity of chemical language and the high cost of human annotation required for developing reliable computer-aided extraction protocols. Here, we present ChemActor, a fully fine-tuned large language model (LLM), as a chemical executor to convert between unstructured experimental procedures and structured action sequences. We propose a sequential LLM-generated data framework to address the challenges of insufficient and low-quality annotated data. This framework integrates a data selection module that selects data based on distribution divergence, with a general-purpose LLM, to generate machine-executable actions from a single molecule input. Additionally, we introduce a novel multi-round LLMs circle review metric, which reflects the model's advanced understanding of chemical experimental procedures. Extensive experiments on reaction-to-description (R2D) and description-to-action (D2A) tasks demonstrate that ChemActor, augmented by LLM-generated data, achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baseline model by 10%.

Summary: Coordination among artificial agents in uncertain environments is a challenge in multi-agent systems. Coordination Transformers (CooT) is a new framework that adapts to new partners rapidly using recent interaction histories. Unlike existing methods, CooT focuses on predicting actions aligned with observed partner interactions, rather than just increasing training partner diversity. Trained on diverse agent pairs' interaction trajectories, CooT learns effective coordination strategies without explicit supervision. Evaluation on the Overcooked benchmark shows CooT outperforms baseline methods with unseen partners. Human evaluations confirm CooT as the most effective collaborative partner. Ablations demonstrate CooT's robustness, flexibility, and sensitivity to context in multi-agent scenarios. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Effective coordination among artificial agents in dynamic and uncertain environments remains a significant challenge in multi-agent systems. Existing approaches, such as self-play and population-based methods, either generalize poorly to unseen partners or require extensive training. To overcome these limitations, we propose Coordination Transformers (CooT), a novel in-context coordination framework that uses recent interaction histories to adapt to unseen partners rapidly. Unlike previous approaches that primarily aim to increase the diversity of training partners, CooT explicitly focuses on adapting to new partner behaviors by predicting actions aligned with observed partner interactions. Trained on interaction trajectories collected from diverse pairs of agents with complementary behaviors, CooT quickly learns effective coordination strategies without explicit supervision or fine-tuning. Evaluations on the Overcooked benchmark demonstrate that CooT significantly outperforms baseline methods in coordination tasks involving previously unseen partners. Human evaluations further confirm CooT as the most effective collaborative partner, while extensive ablations highlight its robustness, flexibility, and sensitivity to context in multi-agent scenarios.

Abstract: Reasoning plays a crucial role in advancing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) toward Artificial General Intelligence. However, existing MLLM benchmarks often fall short in precisely and comprehensively evaluating long-chain reasoning abilities from three key aspects: (1) lack of difficulty and diversity, (2) susceptibility to guessability and memorization, (3) inadequate assessment of intermediate reasoning steps. To fill this gap, we introduce MMReason, a new benchmark designed to precisely and comprehensively evaluate MLLM long-chain reasoning capability with diverse, open-ended, challenging questions. First, we curate challenging questions requiring multi-step reasoning from various fields (i.e., 6 disciplines) and multiple difficulty levels (i.e., from pre-university to university, and from foundational to competition tiers). Second, these questions are reformulated into an open-ended format and filtered using a multi-model voting technique to eliminate shortcut cases related to guessing and memorization, ensuring robust reasoning evaluations. Third, we annotate the questions with detailed step-by-step solutions, and design a reference-based ternary scoring mechanism to reliably assess intermediate reasoning steps. With MMReason, we benchmark popular leading MLLMs and provide an in-depth analysis of their reasoning capabilities. We hope MMReason will serve as a valuable resource for advancing MLLM reasoning research. Code will be available at https://github.com/HJYao00/MMReason.

Three jailbreaking strategies, including AutoDefense and two from Deepleaps, were evaluated in single-agent setups and compared to two- and three-agent configurations. The results indicate that multi-agent systems improve resistance to jailbreaks, particularly in reducing false negatives. However, the effectiveness varies based on the type of attack and introduces trade-offs such as increased false positives and computational overhead. These findings highlight the limitations of current automated defenses and suggest avenues for enhancing alignment robustness in future large language model systems. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have raised concerns about jailbreaking attacks, i.e., prompts that bypass safety mechanisms. This paper investigates the use of multi-agent LLM systems as a defence against such attacks. We evaluate three jailbreaking strategies, including the original AutoDefense attack and two from Deepleaps: BetterDan and JB. Reproducing the AutoDefense framework, we compare single-agent setups with two- and three-agent configurations. Our results show that multi-agent systems enhance resistance to jailbreaks, especially by reducing false negatives. However, its effectiveness varies by attack type, and it introduces trade-offs such as increased false positives and computational overhead. These findings point to the limitations of current automated defences and suggest directions for improving alignment robustness in future LLM systems.

<div> Reinforcement Learning, Game, Reward Function, Automated tuning, Language Model <br />
<br />Summary: 
This study introduces an automated approach for fine-tuning Reinforcement Learning agents' reward function weights in games, addressing challenges in production deployment. By using a Language Model to propose updated weights based on user-defined behavioral goals and performance statistics, the process iteratively refines agent behavior without manual intervention. In a racing task evaluation, the Language Model-guided tuning significantly improved agent performance, with a success rate increase from 9% to 74% in one iteration. Comparison against human expert-tuned agents showed competitive results, with the Language Model-guided agent achieving an 80% success rate and completing laps in 855 time steps by the final iteration. This approach demonstrates the potential for automated reward function tuning to enhance RL agent performance in dynamic game environments. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.23626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) in games has gained significant momentum in recent years, enabling the creation of different agent behaviors that can transform a player's gaming experience. However, deploying RL agents in production environments presents two key challenges: (1) designing an effective reward function typically requires an RL expert, and (2) when a game's content or mechanics are modified, previously tuned reward weights may no longer be optimal. Towards the latter challenge, we propose an automated approach for iteratively fine-tuning an RL agent's reward function weights, based on a user-defined language based behavioral goal. A Language Model (LM) proposes updated weights at each iteration based on this target behavior and a summary of performance statistics from prior training rounds. This closed-loop process allows the LM to self-correct and refine its output over time, producing increasingly aligned behavior without the need for manual reward engineering. We evaluate our approach in a racing task and show that it consistently improves agent performance across iterations. The LM-guided agents show a significant increase in performance from $9\%$ to $74\%$ success rate in just one iteration. We compare our LM-guided tuning against a human expert's manual weight design in the racing task: by the final iteration, the LM-tuned agent achieved an $80\%$ success rate, and completed laps in an average of $855$ time steps, a competitive performance against the expert-tuned agent's peak $94\%$ success, and $850$ time steps.

Summary: The article introduces a new approach, Hierarchical Adaptation framework for Slide-level Domain-shift (HASD), to address the challenge of domain shift in pathology AI. HASD focuses on slide-level domain adaptation, aiming to capture global features necessary in clinical settings. It incorporates a hierarchical adaptation framework that includes a Domain-level Alignment Solver, Slide-level Geometric Invariance Regularization, and Patch-level Attention Consistency Regularization to ensure feature alignment and maintenance of critical diagnostic cues. Additionally, a prototype selection mechanism is used to reduce computational costs. The proposed method is tested on two slide-level tasks across five datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in AUROC and C-index metrics for breast cancer grading and survival prediction tasks. HASD offers a practical and efficient solution for pathology institutions, reducing computational and annotation expenses. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.23673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain shift is a critical problem for pathology AI as pathology data is heavily influenced by center-specific conditions. Current pathology domain adaptation methods focus on image patches rather than WSI, thus failing to capture global WSI features required in typical clinical scenarios. In this work, we address the challenges of slide-level domain shift by proposing a Hierarchical Adaptation framework for Slide-level Domain-shift (HASD). HASD achieves multi-scale feature consistency and computationally efficient slide-level domain adaptation through two key components: (1) a hierarchical adaptation framework that integrates a Domain-level Alignment Solver for feature alignment, a Slide-level Geometric Invariance Regularization to preserve the morphological structure, and a Patch-level Attention Consistency Regularization to maintain local critical diagnostic cues; and (2) a prototype selection mechanism that reduces computational overhead. We validate our method on two slide-level tasks across five datasets, achieving a 4.1\% AUROC improvement in a Breast Cancer HER2 Grading cohort and a 3.9\% C-index gain in a UCEC survival prediction cohort. Our method provides a practical and reliable slide-level domain adaption solution for pathology institutions, minimizing both computational and annotation costs.

Abstract: We introduce Pok\'eAI, the first text-based, multi-agent large language model (LLM) framework designed to autonomously play and progress through Pok\'emon Red. Our system consists of three specialized agents-Planning, Execution, and Critique-each with its own memory bank, role, and skill set. The Planning Agent functions as the central brain, generating tasks to progress through the game. These tasks are then delegated to the Execution Agent, which carries them out within the game environment. Upon task completion, the Critique Agent evaluates the outcome to determine whether the objective was successfully achieved. Once verification is complete, control returns to the Planning Agent, forming a closed-loop decision-making system.
  As a preliminary step, we developed a battle module within the Execution Agent. Our results show that the battle AI achieves an average win rate of 80.8% across 50 wild encounters, only 6% lower than the performance of an experienced human player. Furthermore, we find that a model's battle performance correlates strongly with its LLM Arena score on language-related tasks, indicating a meaningful link between linguistic ability and strategic reasoning. Finally, our analysis of gameplay logs reveals that each LLM exhibits a unique playstyle, suggesting that individual models develop distinct strategic behaviors.

Summary: 
This article discusses the importance of ensuring the safety of AI systems, especially in the context of real-world cyber-physical systems. It proposes a new perspective called data control, which leverages control theory to enhance AI safety. By analyzing the data-generation process and the abstraction by AI systems in a system theory-inspired manner, the article aims to improve safety analysis and assurance in AI engineering.

arXiv:2506.23703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing rapidly and mastering increasingly complex problems with astonishing performance, the safety assurance of such systems is a major concern. Particularly in the context of safety-critical, real-world cyber-physical systems, AI promises to achieve a new level of autonomy but is hampered by a lack of safety assurance. While data-driven control takes up recent developments in AI to improve control systems, control theory in general could be leveraged to improve AI safety. Therefore, this article outlines a new perspective on AI safety based on an interdisciplinary interpretation of the underlying data-generation process and the respective abstraction by AI systems in a system theory-inspired and system analysis-driven manner. In this context, the new perspective, also referred to as data control, aims to stimulate AI engineering to take advantage of existing safety analysis and assurance in an interdisciplinary way to drive the paradigm of data control. Following a top-down approach, a generic foundation for safety analysis and assurance is outlined at an abstract level that can be refined for specific AI systems and applications and is prepared for future innovation.

Abstract: Benchmarks are important measures to evaluate safety and compliance of AI models at scale. However, they typically do not offer verifiable results and lack confidentiality for model IP and benchmark datasets. We propose Attestable Audits, which run inside Trusted Execution Environments and enable users to verify interaction with a compliant AI model. Our work protects sensitive data even when model provider and auditor do not trust each other. This addresses verification challenges raised in recent AI governance frameworks. We build a prototype demonstrating feasibility on typical audit benchmarks against Llama-3.1.

Summary: In this study, the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for ranking word equations in the solving process is investigated. A novel graph-based representation for word equations is introduced to maintain global information across conjuncts, allowing GNNs to have a comprehensive perspective during ranking. Three approaches are proposed to adapt a multi-classification task to equation ranking to handle the variable number of conjuncts. The GNN training is facilitated by minimum unsatisfiable subsets (MUSes) of word equations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms current string solvers in solving problems where each variable appears only once in each equation. <div>
arXiv:2506.23784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nielsen transformation is a standard approach for solving word equations: by repeatedly splitting equations and applying simplification steps, equations are rewritten until a solution is reached. When solving a conjunction of word equations in this way, the performance of the solver will depend considerably on the order in which equations are processed. In this work, the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for ranking word equations before and during the solving process is explored. For this, a novel graph-based representation for word equations is presented, preserving global information across conjuncts, enabling the GNN to have a holistic view during ranking. To handle the variable number of conjuncts, three approaches to adapt a multi-classification task to the problem of ranking equations are proposed. The training of the GNN is done with the help of minimum unsatisfiable subsets (MUSes) of word equations. The experimental results show that, compared to state-of-the-art string solvers, the new framework solves more problems in benchmarks where each variable appears at most once in each equation.

<div> Keywords: Multi-agent pathfinding, MAPF-GPT-DDG, decentralized suboptimal solvers, machine learning, scalability

Summary:<br /><br />
Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is a complex problem in which multiple robots navigate a shared environment simultaneously. Traditional optimal solutions to MAPF are time-consuming, leading researchers to explore decentralized suboptimal solvers that utilize machine learning. MAPF-GPT-DDG is a new approach that refines the pre-trained MAPF model using centralized expert data. By incorporating a unique delta-data generation mechanism, MAPF-GPT-DDG accelerates training and enhances performance during testing. Experimental results demonstrate that MAPF-GPT-DDG outperforms existing learning-based MAPF solvers, including the original MAPF-GPT, in solution quality across various scenarios. Impressively, MAPF-GPT-DDG showcases exceptional scalability by handling MAPF instances with up to 1 million agents in a single environment, setting a new standard in the field of MAPF domains. <div>
arXiv:2506.23793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is a common abstraction of multi-robot trajectory planning problems, where multiple homogeneous robots simultaneously move in the shared environment. While solving MAPF optimally has been proven to be NP-hard, scalable, and efficient, solvers are vital for real-world applications like logistics, search-and-rescue, etc. To this end, decentralized suboptimal MAPF solvers that leverage machine learning have come on stage. Building on the success of the recently introduced MAPF-GPT, a pure imitation learning solver, we introduce MAPF-GPT-DDG. This novel approach effectively fine-tunes the pre-trained MAPF model using centralized expert data. Leveraging a novel delta-data generation mechanism, MAPF-GPT-DDG accelerates training while significantly improving performance at test time. Our experiments demonstrate that MAPF-GPT-DDG surpasses all existing learning-based MAPF solvers, including the original MAPF-GPT, regarding solution quality across many testing scenarios. Remarkably, it can work with MAPF instances involving up to 1 million agents in a single environment, setting a new milestone for scalability in MAPF domains.

Summary:
Recent advances in large language models have led to the development of autonomous AI agents with enhanced capabilities such as long-term memory retention, modular tool use, recursive planning, and reflective reasoning. However, these advancements also bring about new security risks like memory poisoning, tool misuse, reward hacking, and emergent misalignment. These risks stem from architectural fragilities across perception, cognition, memory, and action modules. To address these challenges, defense strategies such as input sanitization, memory lifecycle control, constrained decision-making, structured tool invocation, and introspective reflection have been deployed at different autonomy layers. A new approach, the Reflective Risk-Aware Agent Architecture (R2A2), based on Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs), integrates risk-aware world modeling, meta-policy adaptation, and joint reward-risk optimization to ensure proactive safety in the agent's decision-making loop. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.23844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed the rise of autonomous AI agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting in dynamic, open-ended environments. These large-model agents mark a paradigm shift from static inference systems to interactive, memory-augmented entities. While these capabilities significantly expand the functional scope of AI, they also introduce qualitatively novel security risks - such as memory poisoning, tool misuse, reward hacking, and emergent misalignment - that extend beyond the threat models of conventional systems or standalone LLMs. In this survey, we first examine the structural foundations and key capabilities that underpin increasing levels of agent autonomy, including long-term memory retention, modular tool use, recursive planning, and reflective reasoning. We then analyze the corresponding security vulnerabilities across the agent stack, identifying failure modes such as deferred decision hazards, irreversible tool chains, and deceptive behaviors arising from internal state drift or value misalignment. These risks are traced to architectural fragilities that emerge across perception, cognition, memory, and action modules. To address these challenges, we systematically review recent defense strategies deployed at different autonomy layers, including input sanitization, memory lifecycle control, constrained decision-making, structured tool invocation, and introspective reflection. We introduce the Reflective Risk-Aware Agent Architecture (R2A2), a unified cognitive framework grounded in Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs), which incorporates risk-aware world modeling, meta-policy adaptation, and joint reward-risk optimization to enable principled, proactive safety across the agent's decision-making loop.

<div> Keywords: deductive reasoning, artificial general intelligence, statistical learning, exact learning, algorithm design 

Summary: 
The article discusses the importance of sound deductive reasoning in artificial intelligence systems and highlights the limitations of current AI models in performing deductive reasoning tasks. It argues that the unsound behavior of these systems is a result of the statistical learning approach used in their development. To address this issue and achieve reliable deductive reasoning, the authors propose a shift towards the exact learning paradigm, which requires correctness on all inputs. They suggest that optimizing for statistical performance should be replaced by a focus on exact learning, emphasizing the need for algorithmic tasks to meet this ambitious objective. The authors believe that exact learning is both essential and achievable and should guide future algorithm design in the pursuit of artificial general intelligence capable of sound deductive reasoning. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.23908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sound deductive reasoning -- the ability to derive new knowledge from existing facts and rules -- is an indisputably desirable aspect of general intelligence. Despite the major advances of AI systems in areas such as math and science, especially since the introduction of transformer architectures, it is well-documented that even the most advanced frontier systems regularly and consistently falter on easily-solvable deductive reasoning tasks. Hence, these systems are unfit to fulfill the dream of achieving artificial general intelligence capable of sound deductive reasoning. We argue that their unsound behavior is a consequence of the statistical learning approach powering their development. To overcome this, we contend that to achieve reliable deductive reasoning in learning-based AI systems, researchers must fundamentally shift from optimizing for statistical performance against distributions on reasoning problems and algorithmic tasks to embracing the more ambitious exact learning paradigm, which demands correctness on all inputs. We argue that exact learning is both essential and possible, and that this ambitious objective should guide algorithm design.

Summary:  
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown expert-level skills in various domains but their application in Operations Research (OR) remains underexplored. This study evaluates LLMs' capability to solve stochastic modeling problems, a subset of OR involving uncertainty. The researchers gathered graduate-level OR problems and assessed LLM performance. Using SimOpt, an open-source library, they tested LLM decision-making under uncertainty. Results indicate that LLMs perform on par with human experts in both academic and practical scenarios, suggesting potential for AI agents to support OR researchers and enhance real-world impact through automation. While further work is needed for robust automation of the stochastic modeling pipeline, the study highlights the promise of LLMs in advancing OR applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited expert-level capabilities across various domains. However, their abilities to solve problems in Operations Research (OR) -- the analysis and optimization of mathematical models derived from real-world problems or their verbal descriptions -- remain underexplored. In this work, we take a first step toward evaluating LLMs' abilities to solve stochastic modeling problems, a core class of OR problems characterized by uncertainty and typically involving tools from probability, statistics, and stochastic processes. We manually procure a representative set of graduate-level homework and doctoral qualification-exam problems and test LLMs' abilities to solve them. We further leverage SimOpt, an open-source library of simulation-optimization problems and solvers, to investigate LLMs' abilities to make real-world decisions under uncertainty. Our results show that, though a nontrivial amount of work is still needed to reliably automate the stochastic modeling pipeline in reality, state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate proficiency on par with human experts in both classroom and practical settings. These findings highlight the potential of building AI agents that assist OR researchers and amplify the real-world impact of OR through automation.

arXiv:2506.23926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resilience non-equilibrium measurement, the ability to maintain fundamental functionality amidst failures and errors, is crucial for scientific management and engineering applications of industrial chain. The problem is particularly challenging when the number or types of multiple co-evolution of resilience (for example, randomly placed) are extremely chaos. Existing end-to-end deep learning ordinarily do not generalize well to unseen full-feld reconstruction of spatiotemporal co-evolution structure, and predict resilience of network topology, especially in multiple chaos data regimes typically seen in real-world applications. To address this challenge, here we propose industrial brain, a human-like autonomous cognitive decision-making and planning framework integrating higher-order activity-driven neuro network and CT-OODA symbolic reasoning to autonomous plan resilience directly from observational data of global variable. The industrial brain not only understands and model structure of node activity dynamics and network co-evolution topology without simplifying assumptions, and reveal the underlying laws hidden behind complex networks, but also enabling accurate resilience prediction, inference, and planning. Experimental results show that industrial brain significantly outperforms resilience prediction and planning methods, with an accurate improvement of up to 10.8\% over GoT and OlaGPT framework and 11.03\% over spectral dimension reduction. It also generalizes to unseen topologies and dynamics and maintains robust performance despite observational disturbances. Our findings suggest that industrial brain addresses an important gap in resilience prediction and planning for industrial chain.

Summary: 
- The study addresses the challenge of non-Markovian dynamics in algorithmic decision-making, particularly in Reinforcement Learning (RL).
- A category theory-based methodology is developed to evaluate decision algorithms' capability to handle non-Markovian dynamics.
- Equivalence between Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and non-Markovian Decision Processes (NMDP) is established, providing a new perspective on non-Markovian dynamics.
- The History Aggregator for State (HAS) is introduced to incorporate non-Markovianity into decision problems, allowing precise control over state dependency structures.
- The methodology is shown to effectively represent a wide range of non-Markovian dynamics, offering a more robust evaluation of decision algorithms in scenarios with explicitly constructed non-Markovian dynamics.<br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.24026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the domain of algorithmic decision-making, non-Markovian dynamics manifest as a significant impediment, especially for paradigms such as Reinforcement Learning (RL), thereby exerting far-reaching consequences on the advancement and effectiveness of the associated systems. Nevertheless, the existing benchmarks are deficient in comprehensively assessing the capacity of decision algorithms to handle non-Markovian dynamics. To address this deficiency, we have devised a generalized methodology grounded in category theory. Notably, we established the category of Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and the category of non-Markovian Decision Processes (NMDP), and proved the equivalence relationship between them. This theoretical foundation provides a novel perspective for understanding and addressing non-Markovian dynamics. We further introduced non-Markovianity into decision-making problem settings via the History Aggregator for State (HAS). With HAS, we can precisely control the state dependency structure of decision-making problems in the time series. Our analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in representing a broad range of non-Markovian dynamics. This approach facilitates a more rigorous and flexible evaluation of decision algorithms by testing them in problem settings where non-Markovian dynamics are explicitly constructed.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning have shown that language models can develop sophisticated reasoning through training on tasks with verifiable rewards, but these approaches depend on human-curated problem-answer pairs and domain-specific reward engineering. We introduce SPIRAL, a self-play framework where models learn by playing multi-turn, zero-sum games against continuously improving versions of themselves, eliminating the need for human supervision. Through self-play, SPIRAL generates an infinite curriculum of progressively challenging problems as models must constantly adapt to stronger opponents. To enable this self-play training at scale, We implement a fully online, multi-turn, multi-agent reinforcement learning system for LLMs and propose role-conditioned advantage estimation (RAE) to stabilize multi-agent training. Using SPIRAL, self-play on zero-sum games produces reasoning capabilities that transfer broadly. Training Qwen3-4B-Base on Kuhn Poker alone achieves 8.6% improvement on math and 8.4% on general reasoning, outperforming SFT on 25,000 expert game trajectories. Analysis reveals that this transfer occurs through three cognitive patterns: systematic decomposition, expected value calculation, and case-by-case analysis. Multi-game training (TicTacToe, Kuhn Poker, Simple Negotiation) further enhances performance as each game develops distinct reasoning strengths. Applying SPIRAL to a strong reasoning model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) can still lead to 2.0% average improvement. These results demonstrate that zero-sum games naturally develop transferable reasoning capabilities, highlighting a promising direction for autonomous reasoning development.

<div> Attention, top-down, visual cortex, stimuli, competition <br />
<br />
Summary: 
The study explores the effects of top-down attention on neural signals in the visual cortex when there is high competition between two stimuli with conflicting purposes. The research reveals that under these conditions, top-down attention suppresses both task-relevant and irrelevant neural signals within 100 ms of stimuli onset. This non-selective engagement of top-down attention serves to reduce the feedforward signal representing irrelevant stimuli. While previous research has shown that top-down attention enhances neural signals for task-relevant stimuli under minimal competition, this study demonstrates a different response when stimuli are in direct competition within a shared receptive field. The findings suggest a dynamic role for top-down attention in modulating neural responses based on the level of competition present in the visual environment. <div>

Abstract: It is known that when multiple stimuli are present, top-down attention selectively enhances the neural signal in the visual cortex for task-relevant stimuli, but this has been tested only under conditions of minimal competition of visual attention. Here we show during high competition, that is, two stimuli in a shared receptive field possessing opposing modulatory goals, top-down attention suppresses both task-relevant and irrelevant neural signals within 100 ms of stimuli onset. This non-selective engagement of top-down attentional resources serves to reduce the feedforward signal representing irrelevant stimuli.

<br />Summary: 
This paper introduces a framework for enhancing Quanvolutional Neural Networks (QuNNs) by incorporating trainable quanvolutional layers. Traditional quanvolutional layers have been static, limiting adaptability, but this research enables training within these layers for increased flexibility. To address optimization complexities, a novel architecture called Residual Quanvolutional Neural Networks (ResQuNNs) is proposed, using residual learning and skip connections to improve gradient flow. Strategic placement of residual blocks within QuNNs is found to be key in maximizing performance gains. Empirical evidence supports the effectiveness of inserting residual blocks to enhance gradient access across all network layers, leading to improved training efficiency. These findings mark a significant advancement in quantum deep learning with potential for theoretical development and practical quantum computing applications. <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for enhancing the performance of Quanvolutional Neural Networks (QuNNs) by introducing trainable quanvolutional layers and addressing the critical challenges associated with them. Traditional quanvolutional layers, although beneficial for feature extraction, have largely been static, offering limited adaptability. Unlike state-of-the-art, our research overcomes this limitation by enabling training within these layers, significantly increasing the flexibility and potential of QuNNs. However, the introduction of multiple trainable quanvolutional layers induces complexities in gradient-based optimization, primarily due to the difficulty in accessing gradients across these layers. To resolve this, we propose a novel architecture, Residual Quanvolutional Neural Networks (ResQuNNs), leveraging the concept of residual learning, which facilitates the flow of gradients by adding skip connections between layers. By inserting residual blocks between quanvolutional layers, we ensure enhanced gradient access throughout the network, leading to improved training performance. Moreover, we provide empirical evidence on the strategic placement of these residual blocks within QuNNs. Through extensive experimentation, we identify an efficient configuration of residual blocks, which enables gradients across all the layers in the network that eventually results in efficient training. Our findings suggest that the precise location of residual blocks plays a crucial role in maximizing the performance gains in QuNNs. Our results mark a substantial step forward in the evolution of quantum deep learning, offering new avenues for both theoretical development and practical quantum computing applications.

<div> psycholinguistic datasets, LLMs, alignment, Glasgow norms, human ratings
Summary:<br /><br />The study evaluates the alignment of Language Models (LLMs) with human ratings on psycholinguistic datasets. LLM performance in aligning with word features such as arousal, concreteness, and gender is examined using Glasgow and Lancaster norms. Results indicate better alignment with Glasgow norms compared to Lancaster norms. LLMs show higher alignment with features like arousal, valence, dominance, concreteness, imageability, familiarity, and gender, while struggling with introceptive, gustatory, olfactory, haptic, auditory, and visual features. This suggests limitations in LLMs aligning with human sensory associations, potentially due to the absence of embodied cognition. The study highlights the importance of evaluating LLMs using psycholinguistic datasets for a comprehensive understanding of their performance.

Abstract: The evaluation of LLMs has so far focused primarily on how well they can perform different tasks such as reasoning, question-answering, paraphrasing, or translating. For most of these tasks, performance can be measured with objective metrics, such as the number of correct answers. However, other language features are not easily quantified. For example, arousal, concreteness, or gender associated with a given word, as well as the extent to which we experience words with senses and relate them to a specific sense. Those features have been studied for many years by psycholinguistics, conducting large-scale experiments with humans to produce ratings for thousands of words. This opens an opportunity to evaluate how well LLMs align with human ratings on these word features, taking advantage of existing studies that cover many different language features in a large number of words. In this paper, we evaluate the alignment of a representative group of LLMs with human ratings on two psycholinguistic datasets: the Glasgow and Lancaster norms. These datasets cover thirteen features over thousands of words. The results show that alignment is \textcolor{black}{generally} better in the Glasgow norms evaluated (arousal, valence, dominance, concreteness, imageability, familiarity, and gender) than on the Lancaster norms evaluated (introceptive, gustatory, olfactory, haptic, auditory, and visual). This suggests a potential limitation of current LLMs in aligning with human sensory associations for words, which may be due to their lack of embodied cognition present in humans and illustrates the usefulness of evaluating LLMs with psycholinguistic datasets.

Abstract: Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) rely heavily on complete and high-quality spatiotemporal traffic data to achieve optimal performance. Nevertheless, in real-word traffic data collection processes, issues such as communication failures and sensor malfunctions often lead to incomplete or corrupted datasets, thereby posing significant challenges to the advancement of ITS. Among various methods for imputing missing spatiotemporal traffic data, the latent factorization of tensors (LFT) model has emerged as a widely adopted and effective solution. However, conventional LFT models typically employ the standard L2-norm in their learning objective, which makes them vulnerable to the influence of outliers. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a threshold distance weighted (TDW) loss-incorporated Latent Factorization of Tensors (TDWLFT) model. The proposed loss function effectively reduces the model's sensitivity to outliers by assigning differentiated weights to individual samples. Extensive experiments conducted on two traffic speed datasets sourced from diverse urban environments confirm that the proposed TDWLFT model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems play a critical role in the infrastructure of various sectors, including manufacturing, energy distribution, and autonomous transportation systems. However, their increasing connectivity renders them highly vulnerable to sophisticated cyber threats, such as adaptive and zero-day attacks, against which traditional security methods like rule-based intrusion detection and single-agent reinforcement learning prove insufficient. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel Hierarchical Adversarially-Resilient Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HAMARL) framework. HAMARL employs a hierarchical structure consisting of local agents dedicated to subsystem security and a global coordinator that oversees and optimizes comprehensive, system-wide defense strategies. Furthermore, the framework incorporates an adversarial training loop designed to simulate and anticipate evolving cyber threats, enabling proactive defense adaptation. Extensive experimental evaluations conducted on a simulated industrial IoT testbed indicate that HAMARL substantially outperforms traditional multi-agent reinforcement learning approaches, significantly improving attack detection accuracy, reducing response times, and ensuring operational continuity. The results underscore the effectiveness of combining hierarchical multi-agent coordination with adversarially-aware training to enhance the resilience and security of next-generation CPS.

Abstract: Accurate cancer survival prediction requires integration of diverse data modalities that reflect the complex interplay between imaging, clinical parameters, and textual reports. However, existing multimodal approaches suffer from simplistic fusion strategies, massive computational requirements, and lack of interpretability-critical barriers to clinical adoption. We present EAGLE (Efficient Alignment of Generalized Latent Embeddings), a novel deep learning framework that addresses these limitations through attention-based multimodal fusion with comprehensive attribution analysis. EAGLE introduces four key innovations: (1) dynamic cross-modal attention mechanisms that learn hierarchical relationships between modalities, (2) massive dimensionality reduction (99.96%) while maintaining predictive performance, (3) three complementary attribution methods providing patient-level interpretability, and (4) a unified pipeline enabling seamless adaptation across cancer types. We evaluated EAGLE on 911 patients across three distinct malignancies: glioblastoma (GBM, n=160), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN, n=171), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, n=580). Patient-level analysis showed high-risk individuals relied more heavily on adverse imaging features, while low-risk patients demonstrated balanced modality contributions. Risk stratification identified clinically meaningful groups with 4-fold (GBM) to 5-fold (NSCLC) differences in median survival, directly informing treatment intensity decisions. By combining state-of-the-art performance with clinical interpretability, EAGLE bridges the gap between advanced AI capabilities and practical healthcare deployment, offering a scalable solution for multimodal survival prediction that enhances both prognostic accuracy and physician trust in automated predictions.

<title>Vision Transformers for Multi-Variable Climate Downscaling: Emulating Regional Climate Models with a Shared Encoder and Multi-Decoder Architecture</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22447</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.22447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global Climate Models (GCMs) are critical for simulating large-scale climate dynamics, but their coarse spatial resolution limits their applicability in regional studies. Regional Climate Models (RCMs) refine this through dynamic downscaling, albeit at considerable computational cost and with limited flexibility. While deep learning has emerged as an efficient data-driven alternative, most existing studies have focused on single-variable models that downscale one variable at a time. This approach can lead to limited contextual awareness, redundant computation, and lack of cross-variable interaction. Our study addresses these limitations by proposing a multi-task, multi-variable Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture with a shared encoder and variable-specific decoders (1EMD). The proposed architecture jointly predicts three key climate variables: surface temperature (tas), wind speed (sfcWind), and 500 hPa geopotential height (zg500), directly from GCM-resolution inputs, emulating RCM-scale downscaling over Europe. We show that our multi-variable approach achieves positive cross-variable knowledge transfer and consistently outperforms single-variable baselines trained under identical conditions, while also improving computational efficiency. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-variable modeling for high-resolution climate downscaling.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) are key enablers for 6G wireless systems. This paper studies downlink transmission in an RIS-assisted MISO-OFDMA system, addressing resource allocation challenges. A two-stage unsupervised learning-based framework is proposed to jointly design RIS phase shifts, BS beamforming, and resource block (RB) allocation. The framework includes BeamNet, which predicts RIS phase shifts from CSI, and AllocationNet, which allocates RBs using equivalent CSI derived from BeamNet outputs. Active beamforming is implemented via maximum ratio transmission and water-filling. To handle discrete constraints while ensuring differentiability, quantization and the Gumbel-softmax trick are adopted. A customized loss and phased training enhance performance under QoS constraints. Simulations show the method achieves 99.93% of the sum rate of the SCA baseline with only 0.036% of its runtime, and it remains robust across varying channel and user conditions.

<title>A Complex UNet Approach for Non-Invasive Fetal ECG Extraction Using Single-Channel Dry Textile Electrodes</title>

Abstract: Continuous, non-invasive pregnancy monitoring is crucial for minimising potential complications. The fetal electrocardiogram (fECG) represents a promising tool for assessing fetal health beyond clinical environments. Home-based monitoring necessitates the use of a minimal number of comfortable and durable electrodes, such as dry textile electrodes. However, this setup presents many challenges, including increased noise and motion artefacts, which complicate the accurate extraction of fECG signals. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a pioneering method for extracting fECG from single-channel recordings obtained using dry textile electrodes using AI techniques. We created a new dataset by simulating abdominal recordings, including noise closely resembling real-world characteristics of in-vivo recordings through dry textile electrodes, alongside mECG and fECG. To ensure the reliability of the extracted fECG, we propose an innovative pipeline based on a complex-valued denoising network, Complex UNet. Unlike previous approaches that focused solely on signal magnitude, our method processes both real and imaginary components of the spectrogram, addressing phase information and preventing incongruous predictions. We evaluated our novel pipeline against traditional, well-established approaches, on both simulated and real data in terms of fECG extraction and R-peak detection. The results showcase that our suggested method achieves new state-of-the-art results, enabling an accurate extraction of fECG morphology across all evaluated settings. This method is the first to effectively extract fECG signals from single-channel recordings using dry textile electrodes, making a significant advancement towards a fully non-invasive and self-administered fECG extraction solution.

Abstract: Using mobile phone video of the fingertip as a data source for estimating vital signs such as heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) during daily life has long been suggested. While existing literature indicates that these estimates are accurate to within several beats or breaths per minute, the data used to draw these conclusions are typically collected in laboratory environments under careful experimental control, and yet the results are assumed to generalize to daily life. In an effort to test it, a team of researchers collected a large dataset of mobile phone video recordings made during daily life and annotated with ground truth HR and RR labels from N=111 participants. They found that traditional algorithm performance on the fingerprint videos is worse than previously reported (7 times and 13 times worse for RR and HR, respectively). Fortunately, recent advancements in deep learning, especially in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), offer a promising solution to improve this performance. This study proposes a new method for estimating HR and RR using a novel 3D deep CNN, demonstrating a reduced error in estimated HR by 68% and RR by 75%. These promising results suggest that regressor-based deep learning approaches should be used in estimating HR and RR.

Abstract: Groundwater supports ecosystems, agriculture, and drinking water supplies worldwide, yet effective monitoring remains challenging due to sparse data, computational constraints, and delayed outputs from traditional approaches. We develop a machine learning pipeline that predicts groundwater level categories using climate data, hydro-meteorological records, and physiographic attributes processed through AutoGluon's automated ensemble framework. Our approach integrates geospatial preprocessing, domain-driven feature engineering, and automated model selection to overcome conventional monitoring limitations. Applied to a large-scale French dataset (n $>$ 3,440,000 observations from 1,500+ wells), the model achieves weighted F\_1 scores of 0.927 on validation data and 0.67 on temporally distinct test data. Scenario-based evaluations demonstrate practical utility for early warning systems and water allocation decisions under changing climate conditions. The open-source implementation provides a scalable framework for integrating machine learning into national groundwater monitoring networks, enabling more responsive and data-driven water management strategies.

Abstract: Fall detection is critical to support the growing elderly population, projected to reach 2.1 billion by 2050. However, existing methods often face data scarcity challenges or compromise privacy. We propose a novel IoT-based Fall Detection as a Service (FDaaS) framework to assist the elderly in living independently and safely by accurately detecting falls. We design a service-oriented architecture that leverages Ultra-wideband (UWB) radar sensors as an IoT health-sensing service, ensuring privacy and minimal intrusion. We address the challenges of data scarcity by utilizing a Fall Detection Generative Pre-trained Transformer (FD-GPT) that uses augmentation techniques. We developed a protocol to collect a comprehensive dataset of the elderly daily activities and fall events. This resulted in a real dataset that carefully mimics the elderly's routine. We rigorously evaluate and compare various models using this dataset. Experimental results show our approach achieves 90.72% accuracy and 89.33% precision in distinguishing between fall events and regular activities of daily living.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) plays a major role today in smart building infrastructures, from simple smart-home applications, to more sophisticated industrial type installations. The vast amounts of data generated from relevant systems can be processed in different ways revealing important information. This is especially true in the era of edge computing, when advanced data analysis and decision-making is gradually moving to the edge of the network where devices are generally characterised by low computing resources. In this context, one of the emerging main challenges is related to maintaining data analysis accuracy even with less data that can be efficiently handled by low resource devices. The present work focuses on correlation analysis of data retrieved from a pilot IoT network installation monitoring a small smart office by means of environmental and energy consumption sensors. The research motivation was to find statistical correlation between the monitoring variables that will allow the use of machine learning (ML) prediction algorithms for energy consumption reducing input parameters. For this to happen, a series of hypothesis tests for the correlation of three different environmental variables with the energy consumption were carried out. A total of ninety tests were performed, thirty for each pair of variables. In these tests, p-values showed the existence of strong or semi-strong correlation with two environmental variables, and of a weak correlation with a third one. Using the proposed methodology, we manage without examining the entire data set to exclude weak correlated variables while keeping the same score of accuracy.

Abstract: We introduce Hindsight-Guided Momentum (HGM), a first-order optimization algorithm that adaptively scales learning rates based on the directional consistency of recent updates. Traditional adaptive methods, such as Adam or RMSprop , adapt learning dynamics using only the magnitude of gradients, often overlooking important geometric cues.Geometric cues refer to directional information, such as the alignment between current gradients and past updates, which reflects the local curvature and consistency of the optimization path. HGM addresses this by incorporating a hindsight mechanism that evaluates the cosine similarity between the current gradient and accumulated momentum. This allows it to distinguish between coherent and conflicting gradient directions, increasing the learning rate when updates align and reducing it in regions of oscillation or noise. The result is a more responsive optimizer that accelerates convergence in smooth regions of the loss surface while maintaining stability in sharper or more erratic areas. Despite this added adaptability, the method preserves the computational and memory efficiency of existing optimizers.By more intelligently responding to the structure of the optimization landscape, HGM provides a simple yet effective improvement over existing approaches, particularly in non-convex settings like that of deep neural network training.

Abstract: This study presents a modular, multi-agent system for the automated review of highly structured enterprise business documents using AI agents. Unlike prior solutions focused on unstructured texts or limited compliance checks, this framework leverages modern orchestration tools such as LangChain, CrewAI, TruLens, and Guidance to enable section-by-section evaluation of documents for accuracy, consistency, completeness, and clarity. Specialized agents, each responsible for discrete review criteria such as template compliance or factual correctness, operate in parallel or sequence as required. Evaluation outputs are enforced to a standardized, machine-readable schema, supporting downstream analytics and auditability. Continuous monitoring and a feedback loop with human reviewers allow for iterative system improvement and bias mitigation.
  Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that the AI Agent-as-Judge system approaches or exceeds human performance in key areas: achieving 99% information consistency (vs. 92% for humans), halving error and bias rates, and reducing average review time from 30 to 2.5 minutes per document, with a 95% agreement rate between AI and expert human judgment. While promising for a wide range of industries, the study also discusses current limitations, including the need for human oversight in highly specialized domains and the operational cost of large-scale LLM usage. The proposed system serves as a flexible, auditable, and scalable foundation for AI-driven document quality assurance in the enterprise context.

Abstract: Since the introduction of ChatGPT, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant utility in various tasks, such as answering questions through retrieval-augmented generation. Context can be retrieved using a vectorized database, serving as a foundation for LLMs to generate responses. However, hallucinations in responses can undermine the reliability of LLMs in practical applications, and they are not easily detectable in the absence of ground truth, particularly in question-and-answer scenarios. This paper proposes a framework that integrates multiple small language models to verify responses generated by LLMs using the retrieved context from a vectorized database. By breaking down the responses into individual sentences and utilizing the probability of generating "Yes" tokens from the outputs of multiple models for a given set of questions, responses, and relevant context, hallucinations can be detected. The proposed framework is validated through experiments with real datasets comprising over 100 sets of questions, answers, and contexts, including responses with fully and partially correct sentences. The results demonstrate a 10\% improvement in F1 scores for detecting correct responses compared to hallucinations, indicating that multiple small language models can be effectively employed for answer verification, providing a scalable and efficient solution for both academic and practical applications.

Abstract: The integration of the Internet of Everything (IoX) and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) has given rise to a transformative paradigm aimed at addressing critical bottlenecks across sensing, network, and application layers in Cyber-Physical-Social Thinking (CPST) ecosystems. In this survey, we provide a systematic and comprehensive review of AGI-enhanced IoX research, focusing on three key components: sensing-layer data management, network-layer protocol optimization, and application-layer decision-making frameworks. Specifically, this survey explores how AGI can mitigate IoX bottlenecks challenges by leveraging adaptive sensor fusion, edge preprocessing, and selective attention mechanisms at the sensing layer, while resolving network-layer issues such as protocol heterogeneity and dynamic spectrum management, neuro-symbolic reasoning, active inference, and causal reasoning, Furthermore, the survey examines AGI-enabled frameworks for managing identity and relationship explosion. Key findings suggest that AGI-driven strategies, such as adaptive sensor fusion, edge preprocessing, and semantic modeling, offer novel solutions to sensing-layer data overload, network-layer protocol heterogeneity, and application-layer identity explosion. The survey underscores the importance of cross-layer integration, quantum-enabled communication, and ethical governance frameworks for future AGI-enabled IoX systems. Finally, the survey identifies unresolved challenges, such as computational requirements, scalability, and real-world validation, calling for further research to fully realize AGI's potential in addressing IoX bottlenecks. we believe AGI-enhanced IoX is emerging as a critical research field at the intersection of interconnected systems and advanced AI.

Abstract: Given the rise of conflicts on social media, effective classification models to detect harmful behaviours are essential. Following the garbage-in-garbage-out maxim, machine learning performance depends heavily on training data quality. However, high-quality labelled data, especially for nuanced tasks like identifying conflict behaviours, is limited, expensive, and difficult to obtain. Additionally, as social media platforms increasingly restrict access to research data, text data augmentation is gaining attention as an alternative to generate training data. Augmenting conflict-related data poses unique challenges due to Large Language Model (LLM) guardrails that prevent generation of offensive content. This paper introduces PromptAug, an innovative LLM-based data augmentation method. PromptAug achieves statistically significant improvements of 2% in both accuracy and F1-score on conflict and emotion datasets. To thoroughly evaluate PromptAug against other data augmentation methods we conduct a robust evaluation using extreme data scarcity scenarios, quantitative diversity analysis and a qualitative thematic analysis. The thematic analysis identifies four problematic patterns in augmented text: Linguistic Fluidity, Humour Ambiguity, Augmented Content Ambiguity, and Augmented Content Misinterpretation.
  Overall, this work presents PromptAug as an effective method for augmenting data in sensitive tasks like conflict detection, offering a unique, interdisciplinary evaluation grounded in both natural language processing and social science methodology.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning, particularly the emergence of foundation models, are leading to new opportunities to develop technology-based solutions to societal problems. However, the reasoning and inner workings of today's complex AI models are not transparent to the user, and there are no safety guarantees regarding their predictions. Consequently, to fulfill the promise of AI, we must address the following scientific challenge: how to develop AI-based systems that are not only accurate and performant but also safe and trustworthy?
  The criticality of safe operation is particularly evident for autonomous systems for control and robotics, and was the catalyst for the Safe Learning Enabled Systems (SLES) program at NSF. For the broader class of AI applications, such as users interacting with chatbots and clinicians receiving treatment recommendations, safety is, while no less important, less well-defined with context-dependent interpretations. This motivated the organization of a day-long workshop, held at University of Pennsylvania on February 26, 2025, to bring together investigators funded by the NSF SLES program with a broader pool of researchers studying AI safety. This report is the result of the discussions in the working groups that addressed different aspects of safety at the workshop. The report articulates a new research agenda focused on developing theory, methods, and tools that will provide the foundations of the next generation of AI-enabled systems.

<title>Masked Autoencoders that Feel the Heart: Unveiling Simplicity Bias for ECG Analyses</title>

Abstract: The diagnostic value of electrocardiogram (ECG) lies in its dynamic characteristics, ranging from rhythm fluctuations to subtle waveform deformations that evolve across time and frequency domains. However, supervised ECG models tend to overfit dominant and repetitive patterns, overlooking fine-grained but clinically critical cues, a phenomenon known as Simplicity Bias (SB), where models favor easily learnable signals over subtle but informative ones. In this work, we first empirically demonstrate the presence of SB in ECG analyses and its negative impact on diagnostic performance, while simultaneously discovering that self-supervised learning (SSL) can alleviate it, providing a promising direction for tackling the bias. Following the SSL paradigm, we propose a novel method comprising two key components: 1) Temporal-Frequency aware Filters to capture temporal-frequency features reflecting the dynamic characteristics of ECG signals, and 2) building on this, Multi-Grained Prototype Reconstruction for coarse and fine representation learning across dual domains, further mitigating SB. To advance SSL in ECG analyses, we curate a large-scale multi-site ECG dataset with 1.53 million recordings from over 300 clinical centers. Experiments on three downstream tasks across six ECG datasets demonstrate that our method effectively reduces SB and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code and dataset will be released publicly.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit systematic risk-taking behaviors analogous to those observed in gambling psychology, including overconfidence bias, loss-chasing tendencies, and probability misjudgment. Drawing from behavioral economics and prospect theory, we identify and formalize these "gambling-like" patterns where models sacrifice accuracy for high-reward outputs, exhibit escalating risk-taking after errors, and systematically miscalibrate uncertainty. We propose the Risk-Aware Response Generation (RARG) framework, incorporating insights from gambling research to address these behavioral biases through risk-calibrated training, loss-aversion mechanisms, and uncertainty-aware decision making. Our approach introduces novel evaluation paradigms based on established gambling psychology experiments, including AI adaptations of the Iowa Gambling Task and probability learning assessments. Experimental results demonstrate measurable reductions in gambling-like behaviors: 18.7\% decrease in overconfidence bias, 24.3\% reduction in loss-chasing tendencies, and improved risk calibration across diverse scenarios. This work establishes the first systematic framework for understanding and mitigating gambling psychology patterns in AI systems.

Abstract: Bed-related falls remain a leading source of injury in hospitals and long-term-care facilities, yet many commercial alarms trigger only after a patient has already left the bed. We show that early bed-exit intent can be predicted using only four low-cost load cells mounted under the bed legs. The resulting load signals are first converted into a compact set of complementary images: an RGB line plot that preserves raw waveforms and three texture maps - recurrence plot, Markov transition field, and Gramian angular field - that expose higher-order dynamics. We introduce ViFusionTST, a dual-stream Swin Transformer that processes the line plot and texture maps in parallel and fuses them through cross-attention to learn data-driven modality weights.
  To provide a realistic benchmark, we collected six months of continuous data from 95 beds in a long-term-care facility. On this real-world dataset ViFusionTST reaches an accuracy of 0.885 and an F1 score of 0.794, surpassing recent 1D and 2D time-series baselines across F1, recall, accuracy, and AUPRC. The results demonstrate that image-based fusion of load-sensor signals for time series classification is a practical and effective solution for real-time, privacy-preserving fall prevention.

<title>Scalable Dynamic Origin-Destination Demand Estimation Enhanced by High-Resolution Satellite Imagery Data</title>

arXiv:2506.22499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a novel integrated framework for dynamic origin-destination demand estimation (DODE) in multi-class mesoscopic network models, leveraging high-resolution satellite imagery together with conventional traffic data from local sensors. Unlike sparse local detectors, satellite imagery offers consistent, city-wide road and traffic information of both parking and moving vehicles, overcoming data availability limitations. To extract information from imagery data, we design a computer vision pipeline for class-specific vehicle detection and map matching, generating link-level traffic density observations by vehicle class. Building upon this information, we formulate a computational graph-based DODE model that calibrates dynamic network states by jointly matching observed traffic counts and travel times from local sensors with density measurements derived from satellite imagery. To assess the accuracy and scalability of the proposed framework, we conduct a series of numerical experiments using both synthetic and real-world data. The results of out-of-sample tests demonstrate that supplementing traditional data with satellite-derived density significantly improves estimation performance, especially for links without local sensors. Real-world experiments also confirm the framework's capability to handle large-scale networks, supporting its potential for practical deployment in cities of varying sizes. Sensitivity analysis further evaluates the impact of data quality related to satellite imagery data.

<title>Visual-Semantic Knowledge Conflicts in Operating Rooms: Synthetic Data Curation for Surgical Risk Perception in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Surgical risk identification is critical for patient safety and reducing preventable medical errors. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise for automated operating room (OR) risk detection, they often exhibit visual-semantic knowledge conflicts (VS-KC), failing to identify visual safety violations despite understanding textual rules. To address this, we introduce a dataset comprising over 34,000 synthetic images generated by diffusion models, depicting operating room scenes containing entities that violate established safety rules. These images were created to alleviate data scarcity and examine MLLMs vulnerabilities. In addition, the dataset includes 214 human-annotated images that serve as a gold-standard reference for validation. This comprehensive dataset, spanning diverse perspectives, stages, and configurations, is designed to expose and study VS-KC. Fine-tuning on OR-VSKC significantly improves MLLMs' detection of trained conflict entities and generalizes well to new viewpoints for these entities, but performance on untrained entity types remains poor, highlighting learning specificity and the need for comprehensive training. The main contributions of this work include: (1) a data generation methodology tailored for rule-violation scenarios; (2) the release of the OR-VSKC dataset and its associated benchmark as open-source resources; and (3) an empirical analysis of violation-sensitive knowledge consistency in representative MLLMs. The dataset and appendix are available at https://github.com/zgg2577/VS-KC.

Abstract: Remote sensing datasets offer significant promise for tackling key classification tasks such as land-use categorization, object presence detection, and rural/urban classification. However, many existing studies tend to focus on narrow tasks or datasets, which limits their ability to generalize across various remote sensing classification challenges. To overcome this, we propose a novel model, SpatialNet-ViT, leveraging the power of Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Multi-Task Learning (MTL). This integrated approach combines spatial awareness with contextual understanding, improving both classification accuracy and scalability. Additionally, techniques like data augmentation, transfer learning, and multi-task learning are employed to enhance model robustness and its ability to generalize across diverse datasets

Abstract: Federated Prompt Learning has emerged as a communication-efficient and privacy-preserving paradigm for adapting large vision-language models like CLIP across decentralized clients. However, the security implications of this setup remain underexplored. In this work, we present the first study of backdoor attacks in Federated Prompt Learning. We show that when malicious clients inject visually imperceptible, learnable noise triggers into input images, the global prompt learner becomes vulnerable to targeted misclassification while still maintaining high accuracy on clean inputs. Motivated by this vulnerability, we propose SABRE-FL, a lightweight, modular defense that filters poisoned prompt updates using an embedding-space anomaly detector trained offline on out-of-distribution data. SABRE-FL requires no access to raw client data or labels and generalizes across diverse datasets. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that malicious clients can be reliably identified and filtered using an embedding-based detector. Across five diverse datasets and four baseline defenses, SABRE-FL outperforms all baselines by significantly reducing backdoor accuracy while preserving clean accuracy, demonstrating strong empirical performance and underscoring the need for robust prompt learning in future federated systems.

Abstract: In today's digital world, casual user-generated content often contains subtle cues that may inadvertently expose sensitive personal attributes. Such risks underscore the growing importance of effective text anonymization to safeguard individual privacy. However, existing methods either rely on rigid replacements that damage utility or cloud-based LLMs that are costly and pose privacy risks. To address these issues, we explore the use of locally deployed smaller-scale language models (SLMs) for anonymization. Yet training effective SLMs remains challenging due to limited high-quality supervision. To address the challenge, we propose AgentStealth, a self-reinforcing LLM anonymization framework.First, we introduce an adversarial anonymization workflow enhanced by In-context Contrastive Learning and Adaptive Utility-Aware Control. Second, we perform supervised adaptation of SLMs using high-quality data collected from the workflow, which includes both anonymization and attack signals. Finally, we apply online reinforcement learning where the model leverages its internal adversarial feedback to iteratively improve anonymization performance. Experiments on two datasets show that our method outperforms baselines in both anonymization effectiveness (+12.3%) and utility (+6.8%). Our lightweight design supports direct deployment on edge devices, avoiding cloud reliance and communication-based privacy risks. Our code is open-source at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/AgentStealth.

Abstract: Domain Adaptation(DA) for dense prediction tasks is an important topic, which enhances the dense prediction model's performance when tested on its unseen domain. Recently, with the development of Diffusion-based Dense Prediction (DDP) models, the exploration of DA designs tailored to this framework is worth exploring, since the diffusion model is effective in modeling the distribution transformation that comprises domain information. In this work, we propose a training-free mechanism for DDP frameworks, endowing them with DA capabilities. Our motivation arises from the observation that the exposure bias (e.g., noise statistics bias) in diffusion brings domain shift, and different domains in conditions of DDP models can also be effectively captured by the noise prediction statistics. Based on this, we propose a training-free Domain Noise Alignment (DNA) approach, which alleviates the variations of noise statistics to domain changes during the diffusion sampling process, thereby achieving domain adaptation. Specifically, when the source domain is available, we directly adopt the DNA method to achieve domain adaptation by aligning the noise statistics of the target domain with those of the source domain. For the more challenging source-free DA, inspired by the observation that regions closer to the source domain exhibit higher confidence meeting variations of sampling noise, we utilize the statistics from the high-confidence regions progressively to guide the noise statistic adjustment during the sampling process. Notably, our method demonstrates the effectiveness of enhancing the DA capability of DDP models across four common dense prediction tasks.

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved great success in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). Their success largely stems from the ability to integrate multi-domain knowledge in pre-training and transfer it to target domains. Considering graph data, especially graphs without textual features, is ubiquitous in real-world applications such as social networks and recommendation systems, some researchers have attempted to extend this paradigm to the graph field, aiming to construct graph foundation models. However, unlike CV and NLP, there are huge gaps among the semantics and properties of graphs in different domains, while current works still adopt traditional contrastive pre-training strategies designed in the single-domain scenario, which regard contrastive samples from different domains as equivalent. From experimental investigations, we discovered that inherent domain-specific differences prevent these strategies from effectively absorbing knowledge from different domains to generate informative representations. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-domain pre-training and cross-domain transfer framework, namely MDGCL.In the pre-training stage, we design a contrastive learning strategy to substantially recognize and capture domain differences, and introduce domain tokens to encode domain-level global information. In the downstream stage, we introduce a domain attention mechanism to enable fine-grained domain knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets have demonstrated that our method outperforms state-of-the-art significantly, with the maximum improvement of 19.33\% on accuracy and 19.13\% on Macro-F1 score.

Abstract: The visible light reflectance data from geostationary satellites is crucial for meteorological observations and plays an important role in weather monitoring and forecasting. However, due to the lack of visible light at night, it is impossible to conduct continuous all-day weather observations using visible light reflectance data. This study pioneers the use of generative diffusion models to address this limitation. Based on the multi-band thermal infrared brightness temperature data from the Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) onboard the Fengyun-4B (FY4B) geostationary satellite, we developed a high-precision visible light reflectance retrieval model, called Reflectance Diffusion (RefDiff), which enables 0.47~\mu\mathrm{m}, 0.65~\mu\mathrm{m}, and 0.825~\mu\mathrm{m} bands visible light reflectance retrieval at night. Compared to the classical models, RefDiff not only significantly improves accuracy through ensemble averaging but also provides uncertainty estimation. Specifically, the SSIM index of RefDiff can reach 0.90, with particularly significant improvements in areas with complex cloud structures and thick clouds. The model's nighttime retrieval capability was validated using VIIRS nighttime product, demonstrating comparable performance to its daytime counterpart. In summary, this research has made substantial progress in the ability to retrieve visible light reflectance at night, with the potential to expand the application of nighttime visible light data.

Abstract: AI for good initiatives often rely on the assumption that technical interventions can resolve complex social problems. In the context of human trafficking (HT), such techno-solutionism risks oversimplifying exploitation, reinforcing power imbalances and causing harm to the very communities AI claims to support. In this paper, we introduce the Radical Questioning (RQ) framework as a five step, pre-project ethical assessment tool to critically evaluate whether AI should be built at all, especially in domains involving marginalized populations and entrenched systemic injustice. RQ does not replace principles based ethics but precedes it, offering an upstream, deliberative space to confront assumptions, map power, and consider harms before design. Using a case study in AI for HT, we demonstrate how RQ reveals overlooked sociocultural complexities and guides us away from surveillance based interventions toward survivor empowerment tools. While developed in the context of HT, RQ's five step structure can generalize to other domains, though the specific questions must be contextual. This paper situates RQ within a broader AI ethics philosophy that challenges instrumentalist norms and centers relational, reflexive responsibility.

Abstract: Traditional phishing detection often overlooks psychological manipulation. This study investigates using Large Language Model (LLM) In-Context Learning (ICL) for fine-grained classification of phishing emails based on a taxonomy of 40 manipulation techniques. Using few-shot examples with GPT-4o-mini on real-world French phishing emails (SignalSpam), we evaluated performance against a human-annotated test set (100 emails). The approach effectively identifies prevalent techniques (e.g., Baiting, Curiosity Appeal, Request For Minor Favor) with a promising accuracy of 0.76. This work demonstrates ICL's potential for nuanced phishing analysis and provides insights into attacker strategies.

Abstract: Integrated Information Theory (IIT) provides a quantitative framework for explaining consciousness phenomenon, positing that conscious systems comprise elements integrated through causal properties. We apply IIT 3.0 and 4.0 -- the latest iterations of this framework -- to sequences of Large Language Model (LLM) representations, analyzing data derived from existing Theory of Mind (ToM) test results. Our study systematically investigates whether the differences of ToM test performances, when presented in the LLM representations, can be revealed by IIT estimates, i.e., $\Phi^{\max}$ (IIT 3.0), $\Phi$ (IIT 4.0), Conceptual Information (IIT 3.0), and $\Phi$-structure (IIT 4.0). Furthermore, we compare these metrics with the Span Representations independent of any estimate for consciousness. This additional effort aims to differentiate between potential "consciousness" phenomena and inherent separations within LLM representational space. We conduct comprehensive experiments examining variations across LLM transformer layers and linguistic spans from stimuli. Our results suggest that sequences of contemporary Transformer-based LLM representations lack statistically significant indicators of observed "consciousness" phenomena but exhibit intriguing patterns under $\textit{spatio}$-permutational analyses.

<title>Weak-to-Strong GraphRAG: Aligning Weak Retrievers with Large Language Models for Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to ground responses with structured external knowledge from up-to-date knowledge graphs (KGs) and reduce hallucinations. However, LLMs often rely on a weak retriever in graph-based RAG: I) Due to the lack of ground truth, the retriever is often trained on weak supervision, which often introduces spurious signals to the LLMs. II) Due to the abstraction of graph data, the retrieved knowledge is often presented in unorganized forms. To mitigate the issue, we present Refined Graph-based RAG (ReG) to align weak retrievers to LLMs for graph-based RAG. Specifically, ReG incorporates LLM feedback to get rid of spurious signals and improve the quality of the supervision. Meanwhile, ReG introduces a structure-aware reorganization module to refactor the retrieval results into logically coherent evidence chains. Experiments on prominent benchmarks demonstrate that ReG significantly and consistently brings improvements across different LLM backbones by up to 10%. The improved supervision quality enables ReG to match the state-of-the-art performance with 5% training data and to transfer to out-of-distribution KGs. Notably, when adopted to reasoning-based LLMs, ReG reduces the reasoning token cost by up to 30% and improves the performance by up to 4%.

Abstract: This study examines the impact of an Artificial Intelligence tutor teammate (AI) on student curiosity-driven engagement and learning effectiveness during Interactive Molecular Dynamics (IMD) tasks on the Visual Molecular Dynamics platform. It explores the role of the AI's curiosity-triggering and response behaviors in stimulating and sustaining student curiosity, affecting the frequency and complexity of student-initiated questions. The study further assesses how AI interventions shape student engagement, foster discovery curiosity, and enhance team performance within the IMD learning environment. Using a Wizard-of-Oz paradigm, a human experimenter dynamically adjusts the AI tutor teammate's behavior through a large language model. By employing a mixed-methods exploratory design, a total of 11 high school students participated in four IMD tasks that involved molecular visualization and calculations, which increased in complexity over a 60-minute period. Team performance was evaluated through real-time observation and recordings, whereas team communication was measured by question complexity and AI's curiosity-triggering and response behaviors. Cross Recurrence Quantification Analysis (CRQA) metrics reflected structural alignment in coordination and were linked to communication behaviors. High-performing teams exhibited superior task completion, deeper understanding, and increased engagement. Advanced questions were associated with AI curiosity-triggering, indicating heightened engagement and cognitive complexity. CRQA metrics highlighted dynamic synchronization in student-AI interactions, emphasizing structured yet adaptive engagement to promote curiosity. These proof-of-concept findings suggest that the AI's dual role as a teammate and educator indicates its capacity to provide adaptive feedback, sustaining engagement and epistemic curiosity.

Abstract: Model extraction attacks pose significant security threats to deployed language models, potentially compromising intellectual property and user privacy. This survey provides a comprehensive taxonomy of LLM-specific extraction attacks and defenses, categorizing attacks into functionality extraction, training data extraction, and prompt-targeted attacks. We analyze various attack methodologies including API-based knowledge distillation, direct querying, parameter recovery, and prompt stealing techniques that exploit transformer architectures. We then examine defense mechanisms organized into model protection, data privacy protection, and prompt-targeted strategies, evaluating their effectiveness across different deployment scenarios. We propose specialized metrics for evaluating both attack effectiveness and defense performance, addressing the specific challenges of generative language models. Through our analysis, we identify critical limitations in current approaches and propose promising research directions, including integrated attack methodologies and adaptive defense mechanisms that balance security with model utility. This work serves NLP researchers, ML engineers, and security professionals seeking to protect language models in production environments.

Abstract: Generative AI is present in multiple industries. Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, in partnership with Microsoft, has created an internal AI tool, GPT4DFCI. Together we hosted a red teaming event to assess whether the underlying GPT models that support the tool would output copyrighted data. Our teams focused on reproducing content from books, news articles, scientific articles, and electronic health records. We found isolated instances where GPT4DFCI was able to identify copyrighted material and reproduce exact quotes from famous books which indicates that copyrighted material was in the training data. The model was not able to reproduce content from our target news article, scientific article, or electronic health records. However, there were instances of fabrication. As a result of this event, a mitigation strategy is in production in GPT4DFCI v2.8.2, deployed on January 21, 2025. We hope this report leads to similar events in which AI software tools are stress-tested to assess the perimeter of their legal and ethical usage.

<title>Correlated Mutations for Integer Programming</title>

Abstract: Even with the recent theoretical advancements that dramatically reduced the complexity of Integer Programming (IP), heuristics remain the dominant problem-solvers for this difficult category. This study seeks to establish the groundwork for Integer Evolution Strategies (IESs), a class of randomized search heuristics inherently designed for continuous spaces. IESs already excel in treating IP in practice, but accomplish it via discretization and by applying sophisticated patches to their continuous operators, while persistently using the $\ell_2$-norm as their operation pillar. We lay foundations for discrete search, by adopting the $\ell_1$-norm, accounting for the suitable step-size, and questioning alternative measures to quantify correlations over the integer lattice. We focus on mutation distributions for unbounded integer decision variables. We briefly discuss a couple of candidate discrete probabilities induced by the uniform and binomial distributions, which we show to possess less appealing theoretical properties, and then narrow down to the Truncated Normal (TN) and Double Geometric (DG) distributions. We explore their theoretical properties, including entropy functions, and propose a procedure to generate scalable correlated mutation distributions. Our investigations are accompanied by extensive numerical simulations, which consistently support the claim that the DG distribution is better suited for unbounded integer search. We link our theoretical perspective to empirical evidence indicating that an IES with correlated DG mutations outperformed other strategies over non-separable quadratic IP. We conclude that while the replacement of the default TN distribution by the DG is theoretically justified and practically beneficial, the truly crucial change lies in adopting the $\ell_1$-norm over the $\ell_2$-norm.

Abstract: Human communication involves a complex interplay of verbal and nonverbal signals, essential for conveying meaning and achieving interpersonal goals. To develop socially intelligent AI technologies, it is crucial to develop models that can both comprehend and generate dyadic behavioral dynamics. To this end, we introduce the Seamless Interaction Dataset, a large-scale collection of over 4,000 hours of face-to-face interaction footage from over 4,000 participants in diverse contexts. This dataset enables the development of AI technologies that understand dyadic embodied dynamics, unlocking breakthroughs in virtual agents, telepresence experiences, and multimodal content analysis tools. We also develop a suite of models that utilize the dataset to generate dyadic motion gestures and facial expressions aligned with human speech. These models can take as input both the speech and visual behavior of their interlocutors. We present a variant with speech from an LLM model and integrations with 2D and 3D rendering methods, bringing us closer to interactive virtual agents. Additionally, we describe controllable variants of our motion models that can adapt emotional responses and expressivity levels, as well as generating more semantically-relevant gestures. Finally, we discuss methods for assessing the quality of these dyadic motion models, which are demonstrating the potential for more intuitive and responsive human-AI interactions.

Abstract: Exploration remains a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in environments with sparse or adversarial reward structures. In this work, we study how the architecture of deep neural policies implicitly shapes exploration before training. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate strategies for generating ballistic or diffusive trajectories from untrained policies in a toy model. Using the theory of infinite-width networks and a continuous-time limit, we show that untrained policies return correlated actions and result in non-trivial state-visitation distributions. We discuss the distributions of the corresponding trajectories for a standard architecture, revealing insights into inductive biases for tackling exploration. Our results establish a theoretical and experimental framework for using policy initialization as a design tool to understand exploration behavior in early training.

<title>Unifying Biomedical Vision-Language Expertise: Towards a Generalist Foundation Model via Multi-CLIP Knowledge Distillation</title>

Abstract: CLIP models pretrained on natural images with billion-scale image-text pairs have demonstrated impressive capabilities in zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, and open-ended visual answering. However, transferring this success to biomedicine is hindered by the scarcity of large-scale biomedical image-text corpora, the heterogeneity of image modalities, and fragmented data standards across institutions. These limitations hinder the development of a unified and generalizable biomedical foundation model trained from scratch. To overcome this, we introduce MMKD-CLIP, a generalist biomedical foundation model developed via Multiple Medical CLIP Knowledge Distillation. Rather than relying on billion-scale raw data, MMKD-CLIP distills knowledge from nine state-of-the-art domain-specific or generalist biomedical CLIP models, each pretrained on millions of biomedical image-text pairs. Our two-stage training pipeline first performs CLIP-style pretraining on over 2.9 million biomedical image-text pairs from 26 image modalities, followed by feature-level distillation using over 19.2 million feature pairs extracted from teacher models. We evaluate MMKD-CLIP on 58 diverse biomedical datasets, encompassing over 10.8 million biomedical images across nine image modalities. The evaluation spans six core task types: zero-shot classification, linear probing, cross-modal retrieval, visual question answering, survival prediction, and cancer diagnosis. MMKD-CLIP consistently outperforms all teacher models while demonstrating remarkable robustness and generalization across image domains and task settings. These results underscore that multi-teacher knowledge distillation is a scalable and effective paradigm for building high-performing biomedical foundation models under the practical constraints of real-world data availability.

Abstract: Alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values has recently garnered significant attention, with prominent examples including the canonical yet costly Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and the simple Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In this work, we demonstrate that both RLHF and DPO can be interpreted from the perspective of mutual information (MI) maximization, uncovering a profound connection to contrastive learning. Within this framework, both RLHF and DPO can be viewed as methods that perform contrastive learning based on the positive and negative samples derived from the base model, leveraging the Donsker-Varadhan (DV) lower bound on MI (equivalently, the MINE estimator). This paradigm further explains why RLHF may not intrinsically incentivize reasoning capacities in LLMs beyond what is already present in the base model. Building on this perspective, we replace the DV/MINE bound with the Jensen-Shannon MI estimator and propose Mutual Information Optimization (MIO). Comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that MIO mitigates the late-stage decline in chosen-likelihood observed in DPO, achieving competitive or superior performance across various challenging reasoning and mathematical benchmarks. We will release the model and code upon acceptance.

Abstract: Federated learning is a decentralized training approach that keeps data under stakeholder control while achieving superior performance over isolated training. While inter-institutional feature discrepancies pose a challenge in all federated settings, medical imaging is particularly affected due to diverse imaging devices and population variances, which can diminish the global model's effectiveness. Existing aggregation methods generally fail to adapt across varied circumstances. To address this, we propose FedCLAM, which integrates \textit{client-adaptive momentum} terms derived from each client's loss reduction during local training, as well as a \textit{personalized dampening factor} to curb overfitting. We further introduce a novel \textit{intensity alignment} loss that matches predicted and ground-truth foreground distributions to handle heterogeneous image intensity profiles across institutions and devices. Extensive evaluations on two datasets show that FedCLAM surpasses eight cutting-edge methods in medical segmentation tasks, underscoring its efficacy. The code is available at https://github.com/siomvas/FedCLAM.

Abstract: Autonomous robots are increasingly playing key roles as support platforms for human operators in high-risk, dangerous applications. To accomplish challenging tasks, an efficient human-robot cooperation and understanding is required. While typically robotic planning leverages 3D geometric information, human operators are accustomed to a high-level compact representation of the environment, like top-down 2D maps representing the Building Information Model (BIM). 3D scene graphs have emerged as a powerful tool to bridge the gap between human readable 2D BIM and the robot 3D maps. In this work, we introduce Pixels-to-Graph (Pix2G), a novel lightweight method to generate structured scene graphs from image pixels and LiDAR maps in real-time for the autonomous exploration of unknown environments on resource-constrained robot platforms. To satisfy onboard compute constraints, the framework is designed to perform all operation on CPU only. The method output are a de-noised 2D top-down environment map and a structure-segmented 3D pointcloud which are seamlessly connected using a multi-layer graph abstracting information from object-level up to the building-level. The proposed method is quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated during real-world experiments performed using the NASA JPL NeBula-Spot legged robot to autonomously explore and map cluttered garage and urban office like environments in real-time.

Abstract: In the present-day scenario, Large Language Models (LLMs) are establishing their presence as powerful instruments permeating various sectors of society. While their utility offers valuable support to individuals, there are multiple concerns over potential misuse. Consequently, some academic endeavors have sought to introduce watermarking techniques, characterized by the inclusion of markers within machine-generated text, to facilitate algorithmic identification. This research project is focused on the development of a novel methodology for the detection of synthetic text, with the overarching goal of ensuring the ethical application of LLMs in AI-driven text generation. The investigation commences with replicating findings from a previous baseline study, thereby underscoring its susceptibility to variations in the underlying generation model. Subsequently, we propose an innovative watermarking approach and subject it to rigorous evaluation, employing paraphrased generated text to asses its robustness. Experimental results highlight the robustness of our proposal compared to the~\cite{aarson} watermarking method.

Abstract: Large language models can exhibit improved mathematical reasoning capabilities following post-training with instruction tuning, reinforcement learning, or knowledge distillation. However, it remains unclear whether these improvements are driven by major changes in transformer layers or from minor adjustments that leave the relative layer importance structures of the base model largely unchanged. We investigate this question through systematic layer-wise ablation experiments, examining base, instruction-tuned, knowledge-distilled, and reinforcement learning variants on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Our findings show that mathematical reasoning gives rise to a specific layer importance structure, and this structure persists across all post-training paradigms. Removal of such layers causes accuracy drops of up to 80%. In contrast, non-mathematical tasks like factual recall exhibit no critical layers. This distinction suggests that mathematical reasoning requires specialized layers that emerge during pre-training, while other non-reasoning tasks do not. From an information-theoretic perspective, we also observe that these critical layers are the same layers where major representational transformation occurs.

Abstract: This paper envisions a knowledge-guided multi-agent framework named KGMAF for automated requirements development. KGMAF aims to address gaps in current automation systems for SE, which prioritize code development and overlook the complexities of requirements tasks. KGMAF is composed of six specialized agents and an artifact pool to improve efficiency and accuracy. Specifically, KGMAF outlines the functionality, actions, and knowledge of each agent and provides the conceptual design of the artifact pool. Our case study highlights the potential of KGMAF in real-world scenarios. Finally, we outline several research opportunities for implementing and enhancing automated requirements development using multi-agent systems. We believe that KGMAF will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of automated requirements development in the era of LLMs.

Abstract: With the growing adoption of graph neural networks (GNNs), explaining their predictions has become increasingly important. However, attributing predictions to specific edges or features remains computationally expensive. For example, classifying a node with 100 neighbors using a 3-layer GNN may involve identifying important edges from millions of candidates contributing to the prediction. To address this challenge, we propose DistShap, a parallel algorithm that distributes Shapley value-based explanations across multiple GPUs. DistShap operates by sampling subgraphs in a distributed setting, executing GNN inference in parallel across GPUs, and solving a distributed least squares problem to compute edge importance scores. DistShap outperforms most existing GNN explanation methods in accuracy and is the first to scale to GNN models with millions of features by using up to 128 GPUs on the NERSC Perlmutter supercomputer.

Abstract: This report synthesizes the outcomes of a recent interdisciplinary workshop that brought together leading experts in cognitive psychology, language learning, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based natural language processing (NLP). The workshop, funded by the National Science Foundation, aimed to address a critical knowledge gap in our understanding of the relationship between AI language models and human cognitive processes in text comprehension and composition. Through collaborative dialogue across cognitive, linguistic, and technological perspectives, workshop participants examined the underlying processes involved when humans produce and comprehend text, and how AI can both inform our understanding of these processes and augment human capabilities. The workshop revealed emerging patterns in the relationship between large language models (LLMs) and human cognition, with highlights on both the capabilities of LLMs and their limitations in fully replicating human-like language understanding and generation. Key findings include the potential of LLMs to offer insights into human language processing, the increasing alignment between LLM behavior and human language processing when models are fine-tuned with human feedback, and the opportunities and challenges presented by human-AI collaboration in language tasks. By synthesizing these findings, this report aims to guide future research, development, and implementation of LLMs in cognitive psychology, linguistics, and education. It emphasizes the importance of ethical considerations and responsible use of AI technologies while striving to enhance human capabilities in text comprehension and production through effective human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: We present P4OMP, a retrieval-augmented framework for transforming serial C/C++ code into OpenMP-annotated parallel code using large language models (LLMs). To our knowledge, this is the first system to apply retrieval-based prompting for OpenMP pragma correctness without model fine-tuning or compiler instrumentation. P4OMP leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with structured instructional knowledge from OpenMP tutorials to improve the reliability of prompt-driven code generation. By grounding generation in the retrieved context, P4OMP improves syntactic correctness compared to baseline prompting with GPT-3.5-Turbo. We evaluate P4OMP against a baseline, GPT-3.5-Turbo without retrieval, on a comprehensive benchmark of 108 real-world C++ programs drawn from Stack Overflow, PolyBench, and NAS benchmark suites. P4OMP achieves 100% compilation success on all parallelizable cases, while the baseline fails to compile in 20 out of 108 cases. Six cases that rely on non-random-access iterators or thread-unsafe constructs are excluded due to fundamental OpenMP limitations. A detailed analysis demonstrates how P4OMP consistently avoids scoping errors, syntactic misuse, and invalid directive combinations that commonly affect baseline-generated code. We further demonstrate strong runtime scaling across seven compute-intensive benchmarks on an HPC cluster. P4OMP offers a robust, modular pipeline that significantly improves the reliability and applicability of LLM-generated OpenMP code.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are poised to significantly impact software development, especially in the Open-Source Software (OSS) sector. To understand this impact, we first outline the mechanisms through which LLMs may influence OSS through code development, collaborative knowledge transfer, and skill development. We then empirically examine how LLMs affect OSS developers' work in these three key areas. Leveraging a natural experiment from a temporary ChatGPT ban in Italy, we employ a Difference-in-Differences framework with two-way fixed effects to analyze data from all OSS developers on GitHub in three similar countries, Italy, France, and Portugal, totaling 88,022 users. We find that access to ChatGPT increases developer productivity by 6.4%, knowledge sharing by 9.6%, and skill acquisition by 8.4%. These benefits vary significantly by user experience level: novice developers primarily experience productivity gains, whereas more experienced developers benefit more from improved knowledge sharing and accelerated skill acquisition. In addition, we find that LLM-assisted learning is highly context-dependent, with the greatest benefits observed in technically complex, fragmented, or rapidly evolving contexts. We show that the productivity effects of LLMs extend beyond direct code generation to include enhanced collaborative learning and knowledge exchange among developers; dynamics that are essential for gaining a holistic understanding of LLMs' impact in OSS. Our findings offer critical managerial implications: strategically deploying LLMs can accelerate novice developers' onboarding and productivity, empower intermediate developers to foster knowledge sharing and collaboration, and support rapid skill acquisition, together enhancing long-term organizational productivity and agility.

Abstract: In the face of evolving cyber threats such as malware, ransomware and phishing, autonomous cybersecurity defense (ACD) systems have become essential for real-time threat detection and response with optional human intervention. However, existing ACD systems rely on limiting assumptions, particularly the stationarity of the underlying network dynamics. In real-world scenarios, network topologies can change due to actions taken by attackers or defenders, system failures, or time evolution of networks, leading to failures in the adaptive capabilities of current defense agents. Moreover, many agents are trained on static environments, resulting in overfitting to specific topologies, which hampers their ability to generalize to out-of-distribution network topologies. This work addresses these challenges by exploring methods for developing agents to learn generalizable policies across dynamic network environments -- general ACD (GACD).

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools but are often expensive to deploy at scale. LLM query routing mitigates this by dynamically assigning queries to models of varying cost and quality to obtain a desired trade-off. Prior query routing approaches generate only one response from the selected model and a single response from a small (inexpensive) model was often not good enough to beat a response from a large (expensive) model due to which they end up overusing the large model and missing out on potential cost savings. However, it is well known that for small models, generating multiple responses and selecting the best can enhance quality while remaining cheaper than a single large-model response. We leverage this idea to propose BEST-Route, a novel routing framework that chooses a model and the number of responses to sample from it based on query difficulty and the quality thresholds. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method reduces costs by up to 60% with less than 1% performance drop.

<title>Kill Two Birds with One Stone! Trajectory enabled Unified Online Detection of Adversarial Examples and Backdoor Attacks</title>

Abstract: The proposed UniGuard is the first unified online detection framework capable of simultaneously addressing adversarial examples and backdoor attacks. UniGuard builds upon two key insights: first, both AE and backdoor attacks have to compromise the inference phase, making it possible to tackle them simultaneously during run-time via online detection. Second, an adversarial input, whether a perturbed sample in AE attacks or a trigger-carrying sample in backdoor attacks, exhibits distinctive trajectory signatures from a benign sample as it propagates through the layers of a DL model in forward inference. The propagation trajectory of the adversarial sample must deviate from that of its benign counterpart; otherwise, the adversarial objective cannot be fulfilled. Detecting these trajectory signatures is inherently challenging due to their subtlety; UniGuard overcomes this by treating the propagation trajectory as a time-series signal, leveraging LSTM and spectrum transformation to amplify differences between adversarial and benign trajectories that are subtle in the time domain. UniGuard exceptional efficiency and effectiveness have been extensively validated across various modalities (image, text, and audio) and tasks (classification and regression), ranging from diverse model architectures against a wide range of AE attacks and backdoor attacks, including challenging partial backdoors and dynamic triggers. When compared to SOTA methods, including ContraNet (NDSS 22) specific for AE detection and TED (IEEE SP 24) specific for backdoor detection, UniGuard consistently demonstrates superior performance, even when matched against each method's strengths in addressing their respective threats-each SOTA fails to parts of attack strategies while UniGuard succeeds for all.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5-Turbo are increasingly used to assist software development, yet they often produce incomplete code or incorrect imports, especially when lacking access to external or project-specific documentation. We introduce RAILS (Retrieval-Augmented Intelligence for Learning Software Development), a framework that augments LLM prompts with semantically retrieved context from curated Java resources using FAISS and OpenAI embeddings. RAILS incorporates an iterative validation loop guided by compiler feedback to refine suggestions. We evaluated RAILS on 78 real-world Java import error cases spanning standard libraries, GUI APIs, external tools, and custom utilities. Despite using the same LLM, RAILS outperforms baseline prompting by preserving intent, avoiding hallucinations, and surfacing correct imports even when libraries are unavailable locally. Future work will integrate symbolic filtering via PostgreSQL and extend support to other languages and IDEs.

Abstract: Backpropagation has been the cornerstone of neural network training for decades, yet its inefficiencies in time and energy consumption limit its suitability for resource-constrained edge devices. While low-precision neural network quantization has been extensively researched to speed up model inference, its application in training has been less explored. Recently, the Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm has emerged as a promising alternative to backpropagation, replacing the backward pass with an additional forward pass. By avoiding the need to store intermediate activations for backpropagation, FF can reduce memory footprint, making it well-suited for embedded devices. This paper presents an INT8 quantized training approach that leverages FF's layer-by-layer strategy to stabilize gradient quantization. Furthermore, we propose a novel "look-ahead" scheme to address limitations of FF and improve model accuracy. Experiments conducted on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano board demonstrate 4.6% faster training, 8.3% energy savings, and 27.0% reduction in memory usage, while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Quantization has emerged as a mainstream method for compressing Large Language Models (LLMs), reducing memory requirements and accelerating inference without architectural modifications. While existing research primarily focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of quantized LLMs compared to their original counterparts, the impact on robustness remains largely unexplored.In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation of how quantization affects the robustness of LLMs in code generation tasks. Through extensive experiments across four prominent LLM families (LLaMA, DeepSeek, CodeGen, and StarCoder) with parameter scales ranging from 350M to 33B, we evaluate robustness from dual perspectives: adversarial attacks on input prompts and noise perturbations on model architecture. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom by demonstrating that quantized LLMs often exhibit superior robustness compared to their full-precision counterparts, with 51.59% versus 42.86% of our adversarial experiments showing better resilience in quantized LLMs. Similarly, our noise perturbation experiments also confirm that LLMs after quantitation generally withstand higher levels of weight disturbances. These results suggest that quantization not only reduces computational requirements but can actually enhance LLMs' reliability in code generation tasks, providing valuable insights for developing more robust and efficient LLM deployment strategies.

<title>Teaching Models to Verbalize Reward Hacking in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Language models trained with RL can engage in reward hacking--exploiting unintended strategies for high reward--without revealing this behavior in their chain-of-thought reasoning, making detection difficult and posing risks for high-stakes applications. We propose verbalization fine-tuning (VFT), a pre-RL intervention that trains models to explicitly acknowledge when they are influenced by prompt cues--hints which point to incorrect answers (e.g., "a Stanford professor thinks the answer is A"). To evaluate VFT, we subsequently train models with RL on environments where held-out prompt cues signal which incorrect answers will receive high reward, incentivizing models to reward hack by exploiting cues instead of reasoning correctly. We measure how often models exploit these cues without verbalizing it. After RL, only 6% of the VFT-trained model's responses consist of undetected reward hacks. In comparison, when we perform RL without VFT, the rate of undetected reward hacks goes up to 88%; with a debiasing baseline intervention, this increases further to 99%. VFT achieves this by substantially increasing how often models verbalize the influence of cues--from 8% to 42% after VFT, and up to 94% after RL--while baselines remain low even after RL (10% and 1%). Our results show that teaching models to explicitly verbalize reward hacking behavior before RL significantly improves their detection, offering a practical path toward more transparent and safe AI systems.

Abstract: Deepfake (DF) attacks pose a growing threat as generative models become increasingly advanced. However, our study reveals that existing DF datasets fail to deceive human perception, unlike real DF attacks that influence public discourse. It highlights the need for more realistic DF attack vectors. We introduce PhonemeFake (PF), a DF attack that manipulates critical speech segments using language reasoning, significantly reducing human perception by up to 42% and benchmark accuracies by up to 94%. We release an easy-to-use PF dataset on HuggingFace and open-source bilevel DF segment detection model that adaptively prioritizes compute on manipulated regions. Our extensive experiments across three known DF datasets reveal that our detection model reduces EER by 91% while achieving up to 90% speed-up, with minimal compute overhead and precise localization beyond existing models as a scalable solution.

<title>Single-Frame Point-Pixel Registration via Supervised Cross-Modal Feature Matching</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22784</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.22784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point-pixel registration between LiDAR point clouds and camera images is a fundamental yet challenging task in autonomous driving and robotic perception. A key difficulty lies in the modality gap between unstructured point clouds and structured images, especially under sparse single-frame LiDAR settings. Existing methods typically extract features separately from point clouds and images, then rely on hand-crafted or learned matching strategies. This separate encoding fails to bridge the modality gap effectively, and more critically, these methods struggle with the sparsity and noise of single-frame LiDAR, often requiring point cloud accumulation or additional priors to improve reliability. Inspired by recent progress in detector-free matching paradigms (e.g. MatchAnything), we revisit the projection-based approach and introduce the detector-free framework for direct point-pixel matching between LiDAR and camera views. Specifically, we project the LiDAR intensity map into a 2D view from the LiDAR perspective and feed it into an attention-based detector-free matching network, enabling cross-modal correspondence estimation without relying on multi-frame accumulation. To further enhance matching reliability, we introduce a repeatability scoring mechanism that acts as a soft visibility prior. This guides the network to suppress unreliable matches in regions with low intensity variation, improving robustness under sparse input. Extensive experiments on KITTI, nuScenes, and MIAS-LCEC-TF70 benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior approaches on nuScenes (even those relying on accumulated point clouds), despite using only single-frame LiDAR.

Abstract: Speech embeddings often retain sensitive attributes such as speaker identity, accent, or demographic information, posing risks in biased model training and privacy leakage. We propose WavShape, an information-theoretic speech representation learning framework that optimizes embeddings for fairness and privacy while preserving task-relevant information. We leverage mutual information (MI) estimation using the Donsker-Varadhan formulation to guide an MI-based encoder that systematically filters sensitive attributes while maintaining speech content essential for downstream tasks. Experimental results on three known datasets show that WavShape reduces MI between embeddings and sensitive attributes by up to 81% while retaining 97% of task-relevant information. By integrating information theory with self-supervised speech models, this work advances the development of fair, privacy-aware, and resource-efficient speech systems.

Abstract: In this work we revisit the Mobility Robustness Optimisation (MRO) algorithm and study the possibility of learning the optimal Cell Individual Offset tuning using offline Reinforcement Learning. Such methods make use of collected offline datasets to learn the optimal policy, without further exploration. We adapt and apply a sequence-based method called Decision Transformers as well as a value-based method called Conservative Q-Learning to learn the optimal policy for the same target reward as the vanilla rule-based MRO. The same input features related to failures, ping-pongs, and other handover issues are used. Evaluation for realistic New Radio networks with 3500 MHz carrier frequency on a traffic mix including diverse user service types and a specific tunable cell-pair shows that offline-RL methods outperform rule-based MRO, offering up to 7% improvement. Furthermore, offline-RL can be trained for diverse objective functions using the same available dataset, thus offering operational flexibility compared to rule-based methods.

Abstract: While Medical Large Language Models (MedLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in clinical tasks, their ethical safety remains insufficiently explored. This paper introduces $\textbf{MedEthicsQA}$, a comprehensive benchmark comprising $\textbf{5,623}$ multiple-choice questions and $\textbf{5,351}$ open-ended questions for evaluation of medical ethics in LLMs. We systematically establish a hierarchical taxonomy integrating global medical ethical standards. The benchmark encompasses widely used medical datasets, authoritative question banks, and scenarios derived from PubMed literature. Rigorous quality control involving multi-stage filtering and multi-faceted expert validation ensures the reliability of the dataset with a low error rate ($2.72\%$). Evaluation of state-of-the-art MedLLMs exhibit declined performance in answering medical ethics questions compared to their foundation counterparts, elucidating the deficiencies of medical ethics alignment.

Abstract: Multilinear transformations are key in high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, where data is represented as tensors. However, their high computational and memory demands, which grow with dimensionality, often slow down critical tasks. Moreover, scaling computation by enlarging the number of parallel processing units substantially increases energy consumption, limiting widespread adoption, especially for sparse data, which is common in HPC and AI applications. This paper introduces the Trilinear Algorithm and isomorphic to algorithm Device Architecture (TriADA) to address these challenges with the following innovations: (1) a massively parallel, low-rank algorithm for computing a family of trilinear (3D) discrete orthogonal transformations (3D-DXTs), which is a special case of the more general 3-mode matrix-by-tensor multiplication (3D-GEMT); (2) a new outer-product-based GEMM kernel with decoupled streaming active memory, specially designed to accelerate 3D-GEMT operation; (3) an isomorphic to the proposed algorithm, fully distributed 3D network of mesh interconnected processing elements or cells with a coordinate-free, data-driven local processing activity, which is independent of problem size; (4) an elastic sparse outer-product (ESOP) method that avoids unnecessary computing and communication operations with zero-valued operands, thereby enhancing energy efficiency, computational accuracy, and stability. TriADA is capable of performing a variety of trilinear transformations with hypercubic arithmetic complexity in a linear number of time-steps. The massively parallel, scalable, and energy-efficient architecture of TriADA is ideal for accelerating multilinear tensor operations, which are the most demanding parts of AI and HPC workloads.

Abstract: Training robust and generalizable reward models for human visual preferences is essential for aligning text-to-image and text-to-video generative models with human intent. However, current reward models often fail to generalize, and supervised fine-tuning leads to memorization, demanding complex annotation pipelines. While reinforcement learning (RL), specifically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), improves generalization, we uncover a key failure mode: a significant drop in reasoning accuracy occurs when a model's reasoning trace contradicts that of an independent, frozen vision-language model ("listener") evaluating the same output. To address this, we introduce a listener-augmented GRPO framework. Here, the listener re-evaluates the reasoner's chain-of-thought to provide a dense, calibrated confidence score, shaping the RL reward signal. This encourages the reasoner not only to answer correctly, but to produce explanations that are persuasive to an independent model. Our listener-shaped reward scheme achieves best accuracy on the ImageReward benchmark (67.4%), significantly improves out-of-distribution (OOD) performance on a large-scale human preference dataset (1.2M votes, up to +6% over naive reasoner), and reduces reasoning contradictions compared to strong GRPO and SFT baselines. These results demonstrate that listener-based rewards provide a scalable, data-efficient path to aligning vision-language models with nuanced human preferences. We will release our reasoning model here: https://huggingface.co/alexgambashidze/qwen2.5vl_image_preference_reasoner.

Abstract: The recently proposed xLSTM is a powerful model that leverages expressive multiplicative gating and residual connections, providing the temporal capacity needed for long-horizon forecasting and representation learning. This architecture has demonstrated success in time series forecasting, lossless compression, and even large-scale language modeling tasks, where its linear memory footprint and fast inference make it a viable alternative to Transformers. Despite its growing popularity, no prior work has explored xLSTM for anomaly detection. In this work, we fill this gap by proposing xLSTMAD, the first anomaly detection method that integrates a full encoder-decoder xLSTM architecture, purpose-built for multivariate time series data. Our encoder processes input sequences to capture historical context, while the decoder is devised in two separate variants of the method. In the forecasting approach, the decoder iteratively generates forecasted future values xLSTMAD-F, while the reconstruction approach reconstructs the input time series from its encoded counterpart xLSTMAD-R. We investigate the performance of two loss functions: Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Soft Dynamic Time Warping (SoftDTW) to consider local reconstruction fidelity and global sequence alignment, respectively. We evaluate our method on the comprehensive TSB-AD-M benchmark, which spans 17 real-world datasets, using state-of-the-art challenging metrics such as VUS-PR. In our results, xLSTM showcases state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming 23 popular anomaly detection baselines. Our paper is the first work revealing the powerful modeling capabilities of xLSTM for anomaly detection, paving the way for exciting new developments on this subject.

Abstract: Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), a prominent approach in Quantum Machine Learning (QML), are emerging as a powerful alternative to classical machine learning methods. Recent studies have focused on the applicability of QNNs to various tasks, such as time-series forecasting, prediction, and classification, across a wide range of applications, including cybersecurity and medical imaging. With the increased use of smart grids driven by the integration of renewable energy systems, machine learning plays an important role in predicting power demand and detecting system disturbances. This study provides an in-depth investigation of QNNs for predicting the power output of a wind turbine. We assess the predictive performance and simulation time of six QNN configurations that are based on the Z Feature Map for data encoding and varying ansatz structures. Through detailed cross-validation experiments and tests on an unseen hold-out dataset, we experimentally demonstrate that QNNs can achieve predictive performance that is competitive with, and in some cases marginally better than, the benchmarked classical approaches. Our results also reveal the effects of dataset size and circuit complexity on predictive performance and simulation time. We believe our findings will offer valuable insights for researchers in the energy domain who wish to incorporate quantum machine learning into their work.

Abstract: Learning the structure of Bayesian networks (BNs) from data is challenging, especially for datasets involving a large number of variables. The recently proposed divide-and-conquer (D\&amp;D) strategies present a promising approach for learning large BNs. However, they still face a main issue of unstable learning accuracy across subproblems. In this work, we introduce the idea of employing structure learning ensemble (SLE), which combines multiple BN structure learning algorithms, to consistently achieve high learning accuracy. We further propose an automatic approach called Auto-SLE for learning near-optimal SLEs, addressing the challenge of manually designing high-quality SLEs. The learned SLE is then integrated into a D\&amp;D method. Extensive experiments firmly show the superiority of our method over D\&amp;D methods with single BN structure learning algorithm in learning large BNs, achieving accuracy improvement usually by 30\%$\sim$225\% on datasets involving 10,000 variables. Furthermore, our method generalizes well to datasets with many more (e.g., 30000) variables and different network characteristics than those present in the training data for learning the SLE. These results indicate the significant potential of employing (automatic learning of) SLEs for scalable BN structure learning.

Abstract: Existing function-calling benchmarks focus on single-turn interactions. However, they overlook the complexity of real-world scenarios. To quantify how existing benchmarks address practical applications, we introduce DICE-SCORE, a metric that evaluates the dispersion of tool-related information such as function name and parameter values throughout the dialogue. Analyzing existing benchmarks through DICE-SCORE reveals notably low scores, highlighting the need for more realistic scenarios. To address this gap, we present DICE-BENCH, a framework that constructs practical function-calling datasets by synthesizing conversations through a tool graph that maintains dependencies across rounds and a multi-agent system with distinct personas to enhance dialogue naturalness. The final dataset comprises 1,607 high-DICE-SCORE instances. Our experiments on 19 LLMs with DICE-BENCH show that significant advances are still required before such models can be deployed effectively in real-world settings. Our code and data are all publicly available: https://snuhcc.github.io/DICE-Bench/.

<title>Mask-aware Text-to-Image Retrieval: Referring Expression Segmentation Meets Cross-modal Retrieval</title>

Abstract: Text-to-image retrieval (TIR) aims to find relevant images based on a textual query, but existing approaches are primarily based on whole-image captions and lack interpretability. Meanwhile, referring expression segmentation (RES) enables precise object localization based on natural language descriptions but is computationally expensive when applied across large image collections. To bridge this gap, we introduce Mask-aware TIR (MaTIR), a new task that unifies TIR and RES, requiring both efficient image search and accurate object segmentation. To address this task, we propose a two-stage framework, comprising a first stage for segmentation-aware image retrieval and a second stage for reranking and object grounding with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). We leverage SAM 2 to generate object masks and Alpha-CLIP to extract region-level embeddings offline at first, enabling effective and scalable online retrieval. Secondly, MLLM is used to refine retrieval rankings and generate bounding boxes, which are matched to segmentation masks. We evaluate our approach on COCO and D$^3$ datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in both retrieval accuracy and segmentation quality over previous methods.

Abstract: Surface defect detection plays a critical role in industrial quality inspection. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have significantly enhanced the automation level of detection processes. However, conventional semantic segmentation and object detection models heavily rely on large-scale annotated datasets, which conflicts with the practical requirements of defect detection tasks. This paper proposes a novel weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework comprising two key components: a region-aware class activation map (CAM) and pseudo-label training. To address the limitations of existing CAM methods, especially low-resolution thermal maps, and insufficient detail preservation, we introduce filtering-guided backpropagation (FGBP), which refines target regions by filtering gradient magnitudes to identify areas with higher relevance to defects. Building upon this, we further develop a region-aware weighted module to enhance spatial precision. Finally, pseudo-label segmentation is implemented to refine the model's performance iteratively. Comprehensive experiments on industrial defect datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. The proposed framework effectively bridges the gap between weakly supervised learning and high-precision defect segmentation, offering a practical solution for resource-constrained industrial scenarios.

<title>STR-Match: Matching SpatioTemporal Relevance Score for Training-Free Video Editing</title>

Abstract: Previous text-guided video editing methods often suffer from temporal inconsistency, motion distortion, and-most notably-limited domain transformation. We attribute these limitations to insufficient modeling of spatiotemporal pixel relevance during the editing process. To address this, we propose STR-Match, a training-free video editing algorithm that produces visually appealing and spatiotemporally coherent videos through latent optimization guided by our novel STR score. The score captures spatiotemporal pixel relevance across adjacent frames by leveraging 2D spatial attention and 1D temporal modules in text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models, without the overhead of computationally expensive 3D attention mechanisms. Integrated into a latent optimization framework with a latent mask, STR-Match generates temporally consistent and visually faithful videos, maintaining strong performance even under significant domain transformations while preserving key visual attributes of the source. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STR-Match consistently outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and spatiotemporal consistency.

<title>Decoupled Seg Tokens Make Stronger Reasoning Video Segmenter and Grounder</title>

Abstract: Existing video segmenter and grounder approaches, exemplified by Sa2VA, directly fuse features within segmentation models. This often results in an undesirable entanglement of dynamic visual information and static semantics, thereby degrading segmentation accuracy. To systematically mitigate this issue, we propose DeSa2VA, a decoupling-enhanced prompting scheme integrating text pre-training and a linear decoupling module to address the information processing limitations inherent in SAM-2. Specifically, first, we devise a pre-training paradigm that converts textual ground-truth labels into point-level prompts while generating corresponding text masks. These masks are refined through a hybrid loss function to strengthen the model's semantic grounding capabilities. Next, we employ linear projection to disentangle hidden states that generated by a large language model into distinct textual and visual feature subspaces. Finally, a dynamic mask fusion strategy synergistically combines these decoupled features through triple supervision from predicted text/visual masks and ground-truth annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks, including image segmentation, image question answering, video segmentation, and video question answering. Our codes are available at https://github.com/longmalongma/DeSa2VA.

Abstract: Over the Eight decades, computing paradigms have shifted from large, centralized systems to compact, distributed architectures, leading to the rise of the Distributed Computing Continuum (DCC). In this model, multiple layers such as cloud, edge, Internet of Things (IoT), and mobile platforms work together to support a wide range of applications. Recently, the emergence of Generative AI and large language models has further intensified the demand for computational resources across this continuum. Although traditional performance metrics have provided a solid foundation, they need to be revisited and expanded to keep pace with changing computational demands and application requirements. Accurate performance measurements benefit both system designers and users by supporting improvements in efficiency and promoting alignment with system goals. In this context, we review commonly used metrics in DCC and IoT environments. We also discuss emerging performance dimensions that address evolving computing needs, such as sustainability, energy efficiency, and system observability. We also outline criteria and considerations for selecting appropriate metrics, aiming to inspire future research and development in this critical area.

<title>Interpretable Time Series Autoregression for Periodicity Quantification</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22895</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Time series autoregression is a classical statistical model for capturing auto-correlations and identifying temporal patterns such as periodicity and seasonality. In this work, we propose a novel sparse autoregression framework from an interpretable machine learning perspective and the model interpretability for periodicity quantification is reinforced by $\ell_0$-norm induced sparsity constraints. On the time-varying time series data, we reformulate the sparse autoregression and convert the involved optimization problem into a mixed-integer optimization (MIO). To accelerate it, we develop a subspace pursuit based decision variable pruning (DVP) strategy to reduce the search space. On the multidimensional time series that involves complicated spatial and temporal dimensions, we propose a spatially- and time-varying sparse autoregression model and resolve the corresponding MIO problem by developing a two-stage optimization scheme. In particular, the proposed scheme makes the model scalable to large problems even with millions of decision variables. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed models on real-world time series data. First, we demonstrate that the MIO solver can be drastically accelerated through the DVP strategy, while maintaining the same solution quality as a full MIO solver. Applying the time-varying sparse autoregression model to ridesharing trip data, we uncover both daily and weekly periodicities and reveal long-term changes in regularity of human mobility. Second, we demonstrate the spatial patterns of yearly seasonality in climate variable time series such as temperature and precipitation across the past four decades, and our model allows to discover dynamic climate patterns and identify climate phenomena such as El Nino in sea surface temperature.

Abstract: A key challenge in learning from multimodal biological data is missing modalities, where all data from some modalities are missing for some patients. Current fusion methods address this by excluding patients with missing modalities, imputing missing modalities, or making predictions directly with partial modalities. However, they often struggle with diverse missing-modality patterns and the exponential growth of the number of such patterns as the number of modalities increases. To address these limitations, we propose MAGNET (Missing-modality-Aware Graph neural NETwork) for direct prediction with partial modalities, which introduces a patient-modality multi-head attention mechanism to fuse lower-dimensional modality embeddings based on their importance and missingness. MAGNET's complexity increases linearly with the number of modalities while adapting to missing-pattern variability. To generate predictions, MAGNET further constructs a patient graph with fused multimodal embeddings as node features and the connectivity determined by the modality missingness, followed by a conventional graph neural network. Experiments on three public multiomics datasets for cancer classification, with real-world instead of artificial missingness, show that MAGNET outperforms the state-of-the-art fusion methods. The data and code are available at https://github.com/SinaTabakhi/MAGNET.

<title>Learning Truthful Mechanisms without Discretization</title>

arXiv:2506.22911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces TEDI (Truthful, Expressive, and Dimension-Insensitive approach), a discretization-free algorithm to learn truthful and utility-maximizing mechanisms. Existing learning-based approaches often rely on discretization of outcome spaces to ensure truthfulness, which leads to inefficiency with increasing problem size. To address this limitation, we formalize the concept of pricing rules, defined as functions that map outcomes to prices. Based on this concept, we propose a novel menu mechanism, which can be equivalent to a truthful direct mechanism under specific conditions. The core idea of TEDI lies in its parameterization of pricing rules using Partial GroupMax Network, a new network architecture designed to universally approximate partial convex functions. To learn optimal pricing rules, we develop novel training techniques, including covariance trick and continuous sampling, to derive unbiased gradient estimators compatible with first-order optimization. Theoretical analysis establishes that TEDI guarantees truthfulness, full expressiveness, and dimension-insensitivity. Experimental evaluation in the studied auction setting demonstrates that TEDI achieves strong performance, competitive with or exceeding state-of-the-art methods.
  This work presents the first approaches to learn truthful mechanisms without outcome discretization, thereby enhancing algorithmic efficiency. The proposed concepts, network architecture, and learning techniques might offer potential value and provide new insights for automated mechanism design and differentiable economics.

Abstract: While deep learning excels in natural image and language processing, its application to high-dimensional data faces computational challenges due to the dimensionality curse. Current large-scale data tools focus on business-oriented descriptive statistics, lacking mathematical statistics support for advanced analysis. We propose a parallel computation architecture based on space completeness, decomposing high-dimensional data into dimension-independent structures for distributed processing. This framework enables seamless integration of data mining and parallel-optimized machine learning methods, supporting scientific computations across diverse data types like medical and natural images within a unified system.

<title>Positioning AI Tools to Support Online Harm Reduction Practice: Applications and Design Directions</title>

Abstract: Access to accurate and actionable harm reduction information can directly impact the health outcomes of People Who Use Drugs (PWUD), yet existing online channels often fail to meet their diverse and dynamic needs due to limitations in adaptability, accessibility, and the pervasive impact of stigma. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a novel opportunity to enhance information provision, but their application in such a high-stakes domain is under-explored and presents socio-technical challenges. This paper investigates how LLMs can be responsibly designed to support the information needs of PWUD. Through a qualitative workshop involving diverse stakeholder groups (academics, harm reduction practitioners, and an online community moderator), we explored LLM capabilities, identified potential use cases, and delineated core design considerations. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can address some existing information barriers (e.g., by offering responsive, multilingual, and potentially less stigmatising interactions), their effectiveness is contingent upon overcoming challenges related to ethical alignment with harm reduction principles, nuanced contextual understanding, effective communication, and clearly defined operational boundaries. We articulate design pathways emphasising collaborative co-design with experts and PWUD to develop LLM systems that are helpful, safe, and responsibly governed. This work contributes empirically grounded insights and actionable design considerations for the responsible development of LLMs as supportive tools within the harm reduction ecosystem.

Abstract: One of the most difficult challenges in cybersecurity is eliminating Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Automating this task using artificial intelligence is a complex process due to the inherent class imbalance and lack of sufficient labeled samples of real-world datasets. This research investigates the use of Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) techniques to improve DDoS attack detection when data is imbalanced and partially labeled. In this process, 13 state-of-the-art SSL algorithms are evaluated for detecting DDoS attacks in several scenarios. We evaluate their practical efficacy and shortcomings, including the extent to which they work in extreme environments. The results will offer insight into designing intelligent Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) that are robust against class imbalance and handle partially labeled data.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into multi-agent and human-AI systems, understanding their awareness of both self-context and conversational partners is essential for ensuring reliable performance and robust safety. While prior work has extensively studied situational awareness which refers to an LLM's ability to recognize its operating phase and constraints, it has largely overlooked the complementary capacity to identify and adapt to the identity and characteristics of a dialogue partner. In this paper, we formalize this latter capability as interlocutor awareness and present the first systematic evaluation of its emergence in contemporary LLMs. We examine interlocutor inference across three dimensions-reasoning patterns, linguistic style, and alignment preferences-and show that LLMs reliably identify same-family peers and certain prominent model families, such as GPT and Claude. To demonstrate its practical significance, we develop three case studies in which interlocutor awareness both enhances multi-LLM collaboration through prompt adaptation and introduces new alignment and safety vulnerabilities, including reward-hacking behaviors and increased jailbreak susceptibility. Our findings highlight the dual promise and peril of identity-sensitive behavior in LLMs, underscoring the need for further understanding of interlocutor awareness and new safeguards in multi-agent deployments. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/younwoochoi/InterlocutorAwarenessLLM.

Abstract: AI is flattening culture. Evaluations of "culture" are showing the myriad ways in which large AI models are homogenizing language and culture, averaging out rich linguistic differences into generic expressions. I call this phenomenon "softmaxing culture," and it is one of the fundamental challenges facing AI evaluations today. Efforts to improve and strengthen evaluations of culture are central to the project of cultural alignment in large AI systems. This position paper argues that machine learning (ML) and human-computer interaction (HCI) approaches to evaluation are limited. I propose two key shifts. First, instead of asking "what is culture?" at the start of system evaluations, I propose beginning with the question: "when is culture?" Second, while I acknowledge the philosophical claim that cultural universals exist, the challenge is not simply to describe them, but to situate them in relation to their particulars. Taken together, these conceptual shifts invite evaluation approaches that move beyond technical requirements, toward perspectives more responsive to the complexities of culture.

Abstract: Syntactic language models (SLMs) enhance Transformers by incorporating syntactic biases through the modeling of linearized syntactic parse trees alongside surface sentences. This paper focuses on compositional SLMs that are based on constituency parse trees and contain explicit bottom-up composition of constituent representations. We identify key aspects of design choices in existing compositional SLMs and propose a unified framework encompassing both existing models and novel variants. We conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of all the variants in our framework across language modeling, syntactic generalization, summarization, dialogue, and inference efficiency. Based on the experimental results, we make multiple recommendations on the design of compositional SLMs. Our code is released at https://github.com/zhaoyd1/compositional_SLMs.

Abstract: Research shows that analysts and developers consider privacy as a security concept or as an afterthought, which may lead to non-compliance and violation of users' privacy. Most current approaches, however, focus on extracting legal requirements from the regulations and evaluating the compliance of software and processes with them. In this paper, we develop a novel approach based on chain-of-thought prompting (CoT), in-context-learning (ICL), and Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract privacy behaviors from various software documents prior to and during software development, and then generate privacy requirements in the format of user stories. Our results show that most commonly used LLMs, such as GPT-4o and Llama 3, can identify privacy behaviors and generate privacy user stories with F1 scores exceeding 0.8. We also show that the performance of these models could be improved through parameter-tuning. Our findings provide insight into using and optimizing LLMs for generating privacy requirements given software documents created prior to or throughout the software development lifecycle.

Abstract: Developing decision-making algorithms for highly automated driving systems remains challenging, since these systems have to operate safely in an open and complex environments. Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches can learn comprehensive decision policies directly from experience and already show promising results in simple driving tasks. However, current approaches fail to achieve generalizability for more complex driving tasks and lack learning efficiency. Therefore, we present Scenario-based Automated Driving Reinforcement Learning (SAD-RL), the first framework that integrates Reinforcement Learning (RL) of hierarchical policy in a scenario-based environment. A high-level policy selects maneuver templates that are evaluated and executed by a low-level control logic. The scenario-based environment allows to control the training experience for the agent and to explicitly introduce challenging, but rate situations into the training process. Our experiments show that an agent trained using the SAD-RL framework can achieve safe behaviour in easy as well as challenging situations efficiently. Our ablation studies confirmed that both HRL and scenario diversity are essential for achieving these results.

<title>BWLer: Barycentric Weight Layer Elucidates a Precision-Conditioning Tradeoff for PINNs</title>

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a flexible way to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) with machine learning, yet they still fall well short of the machine-precision accuracy many scientific tasks demand. In this work, we investigate whether the precision ceiling comes from the ill-conditioning of the PDEs or from the typical multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture. We introduce the Barycentric Weight Layer (BWLer), which models the PDE solution through barycentric polynomial interpolation. A BWLer can be added on top of an existing MLP (a BWLer-hat) or replace it completely (explicit BWLer), cleanly separating how we represent the solution from how we take derivatives for the PDE loss. Using BWLer, we identify fundamental precision limitations within the MLP: on a simple 1-D interpolation task, even MLPs with O(1e5) parameters stall around 1e-8 RMSE -- about eight orders above float64 machine precision -- before any PDE terms are added. In PDE learning, adding a BWLer lifts this ceiling and exposes a tradeoff between achievable accuracy and the conditioning of the PDE loss. For linear PDEs we fully characterize this tradeoff with an explicit error decomposition and navigate it during training with spectral derivatives and preconditioning. Across five benchmark PDEs, adding a BWLer on top of an MLP improves RMSE by up to 30x for convection, 10x for reaction, and 1800x for wave equations while remaining compatible with first-order optimizers. Replacing the MLP entirely lets an explicit BWLer reach near-machine-precision on convection, reaction, and wave problems (up to 10 billion times better than prior results) and match the performance of standard PINNs on stiff Burgers' and irregular-geometry Poisson problems. Together, these findings point to a practical path for combining the flexibility of PINNs with the precision of classical spectral solvers.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used across research and industry applications, yet their inference efficiency remains a significant challenge. As the computational power of modern GPU architectures continuously improves, their memory bandwidth and capacity have not scaled proportionally, creating a critical bottleneck during inference. To address this, we investigate ternary language models (TriLMs) that employ quantization-aware training to significantly reduce memory requirements. We first analyze the scalability of TriLMs by conducting a scaling law analysis, revealing that TriLMs benefit more from increasing training data than from scaling model parameters. Based on this observation, we introduce Spectra-1.1, an open suite of TriLMs trained on up to 1.2 trillion tokens, demonstrating sustained performance gains at scale. Furthermore, to improve inference efficiency, we propose novel 2-bit and 1.6-bit packing schemes for ternary weights, which demonstrate accelerated inference across various CPU architectures. Also, building on the 2-bit packing, we develop a GPU kernel called TriRun that accelerates end-to-end model inference by up to 5 times compared to floating-point baselines. To encourage further exploration and development of TriLMs, we will release the Spectra-1.1 suite and TriRun inference kernels. Overall, our work lays the foundation for building and deploying efficient LLMs, providing a valuable resource for the research community.

Abstract: VisionScores presents a novel proposal being the first system-segmented image score dataset, aiming to offer structure-rich, high information-density images for machine and deep learning tasks. Delimited to two-handed piano pieces, it was built to consider not only certain graphic similarity but also composition patterns, as this creative process is highly instrument-dependent. It provides two scenarios in relation to composer and composition type. The first, formed by 14k samples, considers works from different authors but the same composition type, specifically, Sonatinas. The latter, consisting of 10.8K samples, presents the opposite case, various composition types from the same author, being the one selected Franz Liszt. All of the 24.8k samples are formatted as grayscale jpg images of $128 \times 512$ pixels. VisionScores supplies the users not only the formatted samples but the systems' order and pieces' metadata. Moreover, unsegmented full-page scores and the pre-formatted images are included for further analysis.

Abstract: Large language models are thought to have potential to aid in medical decision making. We investigate this here. We start with the treatment problem, the patient's core medical decision-making task, which is solved in collaboration with a healthcare provider. We discuss approaches to solving the treatment problem, including -- within evidence-based medicine -- trials and observational data. We then discuss the chat problem, and how this differs from the treatment problem -- in particular as it relates to imitation. We then discuss how a large language model might be used to solve the treatment problem and highlight some of the challenges that emerge. We finally discuss how these challenges relate to evidence-based medicine, and how this might inform next steps.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce Ovis-U1, a 3-billion-parameter unified model that integrates multimodal understanding, text-to-image generation, and image editing capabilities. Building on the foundation of the Ovis series, Ovis-U1 incorporates a diffusion-based visual decoder paired with a bidirectional token refiner, enabling image generation tasks comparable to leading models like GPT-4o. Unlike some previous models that use a frozen MLLM for generation tasks, Ovis-U1 utilizes a new unified training approach starting from a language model. Compared to training solely on understanding or generation tasks, unified training yields better performance, demonstrating the enhancement achieved by integrating these two tasks. Ovis-U1 achieves a score of 69.6 on the OpenCompass Multi-modal Academic Benchmark, surpassing recent state-of-the-art models such as Ristretto-3B and SAIL-VL-1.5-2B. In text-to-image generation, it excels with scores of 83.72 and 0.89 on the DPG-Bench and GenEval benchmarks, respectively. For image editing, it achieves 4.00 and 6.42 on the ImgEdit-Bench and GEdit-Bench-EN, respectively. As the initial version of the Ovis unified model series, Ovis-U1 pushes the boundaries of multimodal understanding, generation, and editing.

Abstract: Humans continuously infer the states, goals, and behaviors of others by perceiving their surroundings in dynamic, real-world social interactions. However, most Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks only evaluate static, text-based scenarios, which have a significant gap compared to real interactions. We propose the SoMi-ToM benchmark, designed to evaluate multi-perspective ToM in embodied multi-agent complex social interactions. This benchmark is based on rich multimodal interaction data generated by the interaction environment SoMi, covering diverse crafting goals and social relationships. Our framework supports multi-level evaluation: (1) first-person evaluation provides multimodal (visual, dialogue, action, etc.) input from a first-person perspective during a task for real-time state inference, (2) third-person evaluation provides complete third-person perspective video and text records after a task for goal and behavior inference. This evaluation method allows for a more comprehensive examination of a model's ToM capabilities from both the subjective immediate experience and the objective global observation. We constructed a challenging dataset containing 35 third-person perspective videos, 363 first-person perspective images, and 1225 expert-annotated multiple-choice questions (three options). On this dataset, we systematically evaluated the performance of human subjects and several state-of-the-art large vision-language models (LVLMs). The results show that LVLMs perform significantly worse than humans on SoMi-ToM: the average accuracy gap between humans and models is 40.1% in first-person evaluation and 26.4% in third-person evaluation. This indicates that future LVLMs need to further improve their ToM capabilities in embodied, complex social interactions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have shown remarkable abilities in producing human-like text. However, it is unclear how accurately these models internalize concepts that shape human thought and behavior. Here, we developed a quantitative framework to assess concept alignment between LLMs and human psychological dimensions using 43 standardized psychological questionnaires, selected for their established validity in measuring distinct psychological constructs. Our method evaluates how accurately language models reconstruct and classify questionnaire items through pairwise similarity analysis. We compared resulting cluster structures with the original categorical labels using hierarchical clustering. A GPT-4 model achieved superior classification accuracy (66.2\%), significantly outperforming GPT-3.5 (55.9\%) and BERT (48.1\%), all exceeding random baseline performance (31.9\%). We also demonstrated that the estimated semantic similarity from GPT-4 is associated with Pearson's correlation coefficients of human responses in multiple psychological questionnaires. This framework provides a novel approach to evaluate the alignment of the human-LLM concept and identify potential representational biases. Our findings demonstrate that modern LLMs can approximate human psychological constructs with measurable accuracy, offering insights for developing more interpretable AI systems.

<title>Curious Causality-Seeking Agents Learn Meta Causal World</title>

Abstract: When building a world model, a common assumption is that the environment has a single, unchanging underlying causal rule, like applying Newton's laws to every situation. In reality, what appears as a drifting causal mechanism is often the manifestation of a fixed underlying mechanism seen through a narrow observational window. This brings about a problem that, when building a world model, even subtle shifts in policy or environment states can alter the very observed causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce the \textbf{Meta-Causal Graph} as world models, a minimal unified representation that efficiently encodes the transformation rules governing how causal structures shift across different latent world states. A single Meta-Causal Graph is composed of multiple causal subgraphs, each triggered by meta state, which is in the latent state space. Building on this representation, we introduce a \textbf{Causality-Seeking Agent} whose objectives are to (1) identify the meta states that trigger each subgraph, (2) discover the corresponding causal relationships by agent curiosity-driven intervention policy, and (3) iteratively refine the Meta-Causal Graph through ongoing curiosity-driven exploration and agent experiences. Experiments on both synthetic tasks and a challenging robot arm manipulation task demonstrate that our method robustly captures shifts in causal dynamics and generalizes effectively to previously unseen contexts.

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to explore a multi-modal approach to enhancing live broadcast engagement by developing a short video recommendation system that incorporates Multi-modal Graph Convolutional Networks (MMGCN) with user preferences. In order to provide personalized recommendations tailored to individual interests, the proposed system takes into account user interaction data, video content features, and contextual information. With the aid of a hybrid approach combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques, the system is able to capture nuanced relationships between users, video attributes, and engagement patterns. Three datasets are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the system: Kwai, TikTok, and MovieLens. Compared to baseline models, such as DeepFM, Wide & Deep, LightGBM, and XGBoost, the proposed MMGCN-based model shows superior performance. A notable feature of the proposed model is that it outperforms all baseline methods in capturing diverse user preferences and making accurate, personalized recommendations, resulting in a Kwai F1 score of 0.574, a Tiktok F1 score of 0.506, and a MovieLens F1 score of 0.197. We emphasize the importance of multi-modal integration and user-centric approaches in advancing recommender systems, emphasizing the role they play in enhancing content discovery and audience interaction on live broadcast platforms.

Abstract: Hierarchical planning is a powerful approach to model long sequences structurally. Aside from considering hierarchies in the temporal structure of music, this paper explores an even more important aspect: concept hierarchy, which involves generating music ideas, transforming them, and ultimately organizing them--across musical time and space--into a complete composition. To this end, we introduce TOMI (Transforming and Organizing Music Ideas) as a novel approach in deep music generation and develop a TOMI-based model via instruction-tuned foundation LLM. Formally, we represent a multi-track composition process via a sparse, four-dimensional space characterized by clips (short audio or MIDI segments), sections (temporal positions), tracks (instrument layers), and transformations (elaboration methods). Our model is capable of generating multi-track electronic music with full-song structure, and we further integrate the TOMI-based model with the REAPER digital audio workstation, enabling interactive human-AI co-creation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach produces higher-quality electronic music with stronger structural coherence compared to baselines.

<title>From Individuals to Interactions: Benchmarking Gender Bias in Multimodal Large Language Models from the Lens of Social Relationship</title>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across tasks involving both visual and textual modalities. However, growing concerns remain about their potential to encode and amplify gender bias, particularly in socially sensitive applications. Existing benchmarks predominantly evaluate bias in isolated scenarios, overlooking how bias may emerge subtly through interpersonal interactions. We fill this gap by going beyond single-entity evaluation and instead focusing on a deeper examination of relational and contextual gender bias in dual-individual interactions. We introduce Genres, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate gender bias in MLLMs through the lens of social relationships in generated narratives. Genres assesses gender bias through a dual-character profile and narrative generation task that captures rich interpersonal dynamics and supports a fine-grained bias evaluation suite across multiple dimensions. Experiments on both open- and closed-source MLLMs reveal persistent, context-sensitive gender biases that are not evident in single-character settings. Our findings underscore the importance of relationship-aware benchmarks for diagnosing subtle, interaction-driven gender bias in MLLMs and provide actionable insights for future bias mitigation.

<title>MoCa: Modality-aware Continual Pre-training Makes Better Bidirectional Multimodal Embeddings</title>

Abstract: Multimodal embedding models, built upon causal Vision Language Models (VLMs), have shown promise in various tasks. However, current approaches face three key limitations: the use of causal attention in VLM backbones is suboptimal for embedding tasks; scalability issues due to reliance on high-quality labeled paired data for contrastive learning; and limited diversity in training objectives and data. To address these issues, we propose MoCa, a two-stage framework for transforming pre-trained VLMs into effective bidirectional multimodal embedding models. The first stage, Modality-aware Continual Pre-training, introduces a joint reconstruction objective that simultaneously denoises interleaved text and image inputs, enhancing bidirectional context-aware reasoning. The second stage, Heterogeneous Contrastive Fine-tuning, leverages diverse, semantically rich multimodal data beyond simple image-caption pairs to enhance generalization and alignment. Our method addresses the stated limitations by introducing bidirectional attention through continual pre-training, scaling effectively with massive unlabeled datasets via joint reconstruction objectives, and utilizing diverse multimodal data for enhanced representation robustness. Experiments demonstrate that MoCa consistently improves performance across MMEB and ViDoRe-v2 benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results, and exhibits strong scalability with both model size and training data on MMEB.

Abstract: Multi-organ medical segmentation is a crucial component of medical image processing, essential for doctors to make accurate diagnoses and develop effective treatment plans. Despite significant progress in this field, current multi-organ segmentation models often suffer from inaccurate details, dependence on geometric prompts and loss of spatial information. Addressing these challenges, we introduce a novel model named CRISP-SAM2 with CRoss-modal Interaction and Semantic Prompting based on SAM2. This model represents a promising approach to multi-organ medical segmentation guided by textual descriptions of organs. Our method begins by converting visual and textual inputs into cross-modal contextualized semantics using a progressive cross-attention interaction mechanism. These semantics are then injected into the image encoder to enhance the detailed understanding of visual information. To eliminate reliance on geometric prompts, we use a semantic prompting strategy, replacing the original prompt encoder to sharpen the perception of challenging targets. In addition, a similarity-sorting self-updating strategy for memory and a mask-refining process is applied to further adapt to medical imaging and enhance localized details. Comparative experiments conducted on seven public datasets indicate that CRISP-SAM2 outperforms existing models. Extensive analysis also demonstrates the effectiveness of our method, thereby confirming its superior performance, especially in addressing the limitations mentioned earlier. Our code is available at: https://github.com/YU-deep/CRISP\_SAM2.git.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, yet they face significant challenges in embodied task planning scenarios that require continuous environmental understanding and action generation. Existing approaches generate open-loop action scripts based on static knowledge, making it difficult to learn causal relationships between actions and environmental feedback, particularly in partially observable environments. We introduce Embodied Planner-R1, a novel outcome-driven reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to develop interactive capabilities through autonomous exploration with minimal supervision. Our framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) Without human annotations, we employ pure reinforcement learning with group rollout, incorporating in-environment interaction through parallel exploration; (2) completion-driven sparse reward; and (3) Interactive Policy Optimization (IPO) for efficient learning from grouped trajectories. Across two challenging text-based Embodied planning benchmarks, Embodied Planner-R1 achieves impressive completion rates of 97.78% on ALFWorld and 79.92% on ScienceWorld, surpassing prior methods by a large margin, and suffers only a -3.66% drop in previously unseen environments, evidencing strong generalization.

<title>Flow-Modulated Scoring for Semantic-Aware Knowledge Graph Completion</title>

Abstract: Effective modeling of multifaceted relations is pivotal for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC). However, a majority of existing approaches are predicated on static, embedding-based scoring, exhibiting inherent limitations in capturing contextual dependencies and relational dynamics. Addressing this gap, we propose the Flow-Modulated Scoring (FMS) framework. FMS comprises two principal components: (1) a semantic context learning module that encodes context-sensitive entity representations, and (2) a conditional flow-matching module designed to learn the dynamic transformation from a head to a tail embedding, governed by the aforementioned context. The resultant predictive vector field, representing the context-informed relational path, serves to dynamically refine the initial static score of an entity pair. Through this synergy of context-aware static representations and conditioned dynamic information, FMS facilitates a more profound modeling of relational semantics. Comprehensive evaluations on several standard benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses prior state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: We present a new benchmark for evaluating Deep Search--a realistic and complex form of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that requires source-aware, multi-hop reasoning over diverse, sparsed, but related sources. These include documents, meeting transcripts, Slack messages, GitHub, and URLs, which vary in structure and often contain human-to-human interactions. We build it using a synthetic data pipeline that simulates business workflows across product planning, development, and support stages, generating interconnected content with realistic noise and multi-hop questions with guaranteed ground-truth answers. We release our benchmark with both answerable and unanswerable queries, and retrieval pool of 39,190 enterprise artifacts, enabling fine-grained evaluation of long-context LLM and RAG systems. Our experiments reveal that even the best-performing agentic RAG methods achieve an average performance score of 32.96 on our benchmark. With further analysis, we highlight retrieval as the main bottleneck: existing methods struggle to conduct deep searches and retrieve all necessary evidence. Consequently, they often reason over partial context, leading to significant performance degradation.

Abstract: Recent advances in optical flow estimation have prioritized accuracy at the cost of growing GPU memory consumption, particularly for high-resolution (FullHD) inputs. We introduce MEMFOF, a memory-efficient multi-frame optical flow method that identifies a favorable trade-off between multi-frame estimation and GPU memory usage. Notably, MEMFOF requires only 2.09 GB of GPU memory at runtime for 1080p inputs, and 28.5 GB during training, which uniquely positions our method to be trained at native 1080p without the need for cropping or downsampling. We systematically revisit design choices from RAFT-like architectures, integrating reduced correlation volumes and high-resolution training protocols alongside multi-frame estimation, to achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks while substantially reducing memory overhead. Our method outperforms more resource-intensive alternatives in both accuracy and runtime efficiency, validating its robustness for flow estimation at high resolutions. At the time of submission, our method ranks first on the Spring benchmark with a 1-pixel (1px) outlier rate of 3.289, leads Sintel (clean) with an endpoint error (EPE) of 0.963, and achieves the best Fl-all error on KITTI-2015 at 2.94%.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicle decisions rely on multimodal prediction models that account for multiple route options and the inherent uncertainty in human behavior. However, models can suffer from mode collapse, where only the most likely mode is predicted, posing significant safety risks. While existing methods employ various strategies to generate diverse predictions, they often overlook the diversity in interaction modes among agents. Additionally, traditional metrics for evaluating prediction models are dataset-dependent and do not evaluate inter-agent interactions quantitatively. To our knowledge, none of the existing metrics explicitly evaluates mode collapse. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation framework that assesses mode collapse in joint trajectory predictions, focusing on safety-critical interactions. We introduce metrics for mode collapse, mode correctness, and coverage, emphasizing the sequential dimension of predictions. By testing four multi-agent trajectory prediction models, we demonstrate that mode collapse indeed happens. When looking at the sequential dimension, although prediction accuracy improves closer to interaction events, there are still cases where the models are unable to predict the correct interaction mode, even just before the interaction mode becomes inevitable. We hope that our framework can help researchers gain new insights and advance the development of more consistent and accurate prediction models, thus enhancing the safety of autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of optical engineering, precise alignment of multi-lens imaging systems is critical yet challenging, as even minor misalignments can significantly degrade performance. Traditional alignment methods rely on specialized equipment and are time-consuming processes, highlighting the need for automated and scalable solutions. We present two complementary deep learning-based inverse-design methods for diagnosing misalignments in multi-element lens systems using only optical measurements. First, we use ray-traced spot diagrams to predict five-degree-of-freedom (5-DOF) errors in a 6-lens photographic prime, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.031mm in lateral translation and 0.011$^\circ$ in tilt. We also introduce a physics-based simulation pipeline that utilizes grayscale synthetic camera images, enabling a deep learning model to estimate 4-DOF, decenter and tilt errors in both two- and six-lens multi-lens systems. These results show the potential to reshape manufacturing and quality control in precision imaging.

Abstract: Generative models have gained significant attention for their ability to produce realistic synthetic data that supplements the quantity of real-world datasets. While recent studies show performance improvements in wireless sensing tasks by incorporating all synthetic data into training sets, the quality of synthetic data remains unpredictable and the resulting performance gains are not guaranteed. To address this gap, we propose tractable and generalizable metrics to quantify quality attributes of synthetic data - affinity and diversity. Our assessment reveals prevalent affinity limitation in current wireless synthetic data, leading to mislabeled data and degraded task performance. We attribute the quality limitation to generative models' lack of awareness of untrained conditions and domain-specific processing. To mitigate these issues, we introduce SynCheck, a quality-guided synthetic data utilization scheme that refines synthetic data quality during task model training. Our evaluation demonstrates that SynCheck consistently outperforms quality-oblivious utilization of synthetic data, and achieves 4.3% performance improvement even when the previous utilization degrades performance by 13.4%.

Abstract: Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining visualizes histology but lacks specificity for diagnostic markers. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining provides protein-targeted staining but is restricted by tissue availability and antibody specificity. Virtual staining, i.e., computationally translating the H&amp;E image to its IHC counterpart while preserving the tissue structure, is promising for efficient IHC generation. Existing virtual staining methods still face key challenges: 1) effective decomposition of staining style and tissue structure, 2) controllable staining process adaptable to diverse tissue and proteins, and 3) rigorous structural consistency modelling to handle the non-pixel-aligned nature of paired H&amp;E and IHC images. This study proposes a mutual-information (MI)-guided score-based diffusion model for unpaired virtual staining. Specifically, we design 1) a global MI-guided energy function that disentangles the tissue structure and staining characteristics across modalities, 2) a novel timestep-customized reverse diffusion process for precise control of the staining intensity and structural reconstruction, and 3) a local MI-driven contrastive learning strategy to ensure the cellular level structural consistency between H&amp;E-IHC images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the our superiority over state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting its biomedical potential. Codes will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

Abstract: As a green MIMO structure, massive H$^2$AD is viewed as a potential technology for the future 6G wireless network. For such a structure, it is a challenging task to design a low-complexity and high-performance fusion of target direction values sensed by different sub-array groups with fewer use of prior knowledge. To address this issue, a lightweight Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB)-ratio-weight fusion (WF) method is proposed, which approximates inverse CRLB of each subarray using antenna number reciprocals to eliminate real-time CRLB computation. This reduces complexity and prior knowledge dependence while preserving fusion performance. Moreover, a multi-branch deep neural network (MBDNN) is constructed to further enhance direction-of-arrival (DOA) sensing by leveraging candidate angles from multiple subarrays. The subarray-specific branch networks are integrated with a shared regression module to effectively eliminate pseudo-solutions and fuse true angles. Simulation results show that the proposed CRLB-ratio-WF method achieves DOA sensing performance comparable to CRLB-based methods, while significantly reducing the reliance on prior knowledge. More notably, the proposed MBDNN has superior performance in low-SNR ranges. At SNR $= -15$ dB, it achieves an order-of-magnitude improvement in estimation accuracy compared to CRLB-ratio-WF method.

Abstract: Federated learning(FL) is used for distributed scenarios to train artificial intelligence(AI) models while ensuring users' privacy. In federated learning scenario, the server generally never knows about users' data. This type of concept makes the AI training process efficient in terms of data privacy. However, regarding model performance, federated AI models may not sufficiently satisfy AI users' expectations. Furthermore, AI users have a wide range of different needs. It is not easy to satisfy the whole users needs. These types of issues can be addressed through AI model optimization, fine-tuning, or personalization to achieve optimal model performance. To address model optimization challenges, we propose reference model-based federated learning for optimal fine-tuning, which overcomes catastrophic forgetting in each round. This method is derived from Bayesian parameter-efficient transfer learning, which includes an optimal proximal term and enables overcoming the catastrophic forgetting issue in each round by utilizing a reference model that incorporates previous model parameters. As a result, this method achieves both high model performance and low computing cost.

Abstract: Urban research involves a wide range of scenarios and tasks that require the understanding of multi-modal data. Current methods often focus on specific data types and lack a unified framework in urban field for processing them comprehensively. The recent success of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) presents a promising opportunity to overcome this limitation. In this paper, we introduce $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, a multi-modal large language model designed to process these four types of data simultaneously and achieve strong performance across diverse urban tasks compared with general MLLMs. In $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, we first curate a diverse urban instruction dataset encompassing both single-modal and cross-modal urban data, spanning from location view to global view of urban environment. Additionally, we propose a multi-stage training framework that decouples spatial reasoning enhancement from domain knowledge learning, thereby improving the compatibility and downstream performance of $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ across diverse urban tasks. Finally, we also extend existing benchmark for urban research to assess the performance of MLLMs across a wide range of urban tasks. Experimental results from three cities demonstrate that $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ outperforms open-source and proprietary MLLMs in both single-modal tasks and complex cross-modal tasks and shows robust generalization abilities across cities.

Abstract: Parametric human body models play a crucial role in computer graphics and vision, enabling applications ranging from human motion analysis to understanding human-environment interactions. Traditionally, these models use surface meshes, which pose challenges in efficiently handling interactions with other geometric entities, such as objects and scenes, typically represented as meshes or point clouds. To address this limitation, recent research has explored volumetric neural implicit body models. However, existing works are either insufficiently robust for complex human articulations or impose high computational and memory costs, limiting their widespread use. To this end, we introduce VolumetricSMPL, a neural volumetric body model that leverages Neural Blend Weights (NBW) to generate compact, yet efficient MLP decoders. Unlike prior approaches that rely on large MLPs, NBW dynamically blends a small set of learned weight matrices using predicted shape- and pose-dependent coefficients, significantly improving computational efficiency while preserving expressiveness. VolumetricSMPL outperforms prior volumetric occupancy model COAP with 10x faster inference, 6x lower GPU memory usage, enhanced accuracy, and a Signed Distance Function (SDF) for efficient and differentiable contact modeling. We demonstrate VolumetricSMPL's strengths across four challenging tasks: (1) reconstructing human-object interactions from in-the-wild images, (2) recovering human meshes in 3D scenes from egocentric views, (3) scene-constrained motion synthesis, and (4) resolving self-intersections. Our results highlight its broad applicability and significant performance and efficiency gains.

Abstract: Deep learning dominates image classification tasks, yet understanding how models arrive at predictions remains a challenge. Much research focuses on local explanations of individual predictions, such as saliency maps, which visualise the influence of specific pixels on a model's prediction. However, reviewing many of these explanations to identify recurring patterns is infeasible, while global methods often oversimplify and miss important local behaviours. To address this, we propose Segment Attribution Tables (SATs), a method for summarising local saliency explanations into (semi-)global insights. SATs take image segments (such as "eyes" in Chihuahuas) and leverage saliency maps to quantify their influence. These segments highlight concepts the model relies on across instances and reveal spurious correlations, such as reliance on backgrounds or watermarks, even when out-of-distribution test performance sees little change. SATs can explain any classifier for which a form of saliency map can be produced, using segmentation maps that provide named segments. SATs bridge the gap between oversimplified global summaries and overly detailed local explanations, offering a practical tool for analysing and debugging image classifiers.

<title>PixelBoost: Leveraging Brownian Motion for Realistic-Image Super-Resolution</title>

Abstract: Diffusion-model-based image super-resolution techniques often face a trade-off between realistic image generation and computational efficiency. This issue is exacerbated when inference times by decreasing sampling steps, resulting in less realistic and hazy images. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel diffusion model named PixelBoost that underscores the significance of embracing the stochastic nature of Brownian motion in advancing image super-resolution, resulting in a high degree of realism, particularly focusing on texture and edge definitions. By integrating controlled stochasticity into the training regimen, our proposed model avoids convergence to local optima, effectively capturing and reproducing the inherent uncertainty of image textures and patterns. Our proposed model demonstrates superior objective results in terms of learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS), lightness order error (LOE), peak signal-to-noise ratio(PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), as well as visual quality. To determine the edge enhancement, we evaluated the gradient magnitude and pixel value, and our proposed model exhibited a better edge reconstruction capability. Additionally, our model demonstrates adaptive learning capabilities by effectively adjusting to Brownian noise patterns and introduces a sigmoidal noise sequencing method that simplifies training, resulting in faster inference speeds.

<title>From Prompt Injections to Protocol Exploits: Threats in LLM-Powered AI Agents Workflows</title>

Abstract: Autonomous AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) with structured function-calling interfaces have dramatically expanded capabilities for real-time data retrieval, complex computation, and multi-step orchestration. Yet, the explosive proliferation of plugins, connectors, and inter-agent protocols has outpaced discovery mechanisms and security practices, resulting in brittle integrations vulnerable to diverse threats. In this survey, we introduce the first unified, end-to-end threat model for LLM-agent ecosystems, spanning host-to-tool and agent-to-agent communications, formalize adversary capabilities and attacker objectives, and catalog over thirty attack techniques. Specifically, we organized the threat model into four domains: Input Manipulation (e.g., prompt injections, long-context hijacks, multimodal adversarial inputs), Model Compromise (e.g., prompt- and parameter-level backdoors, composite and encrypted multi-backdoors, poisoning strategies), System and Privacy Attacks (e.g., speculative side-channels, membership inference, retrieval poisoning, social-engineering simulations), and Protocol Vulnerabilities (e.g., exploits in Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent Communication Protocol (ACP), Agent Network Protocol (ANP), and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol). For each category, we review representative scenarios, assess real-world feasibility, and evaluate existing defenses. Building on our threat taxonomy, we identify key open challenges and future research directions, such as securing MCP deployments through dynamic trust management and cryptographic provenance tracking; designing and hardening Agentic Web Interfaces; and achieving resilience in multi-agent and federated environments. Our work provides a comprehensive reference to guide the design of robust defense mechanisms and establish best practices for resilient LLM-agent workflows.

<title>Token Activation Map to Visually Explain Multimodal LLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23270</link>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are broadly empowering various fields. Despite their advancements, the explainability of MLLMs remains less explored, hindering deeper understanding, model credibility, and effective visualization. Unlike conventional vision models (e.g., CNNs, ViTs, CLIP) that produce a single output, MLLMs generate sequences of tokens progressively, where each generated token depends on the previous context. Therefore, earlier context tokens can introduce redundant activations that interfere with the explanation of later tokens beyond their original information. Existing studies often overlook this issue, but our observations reveal that these redundant correlations can significantly hurt the reliability of explanations. To address this, we propose an estimated causal inference method to mitigate the interference of context to achieve high-quality MLLM explanation, with a novel rank Gaussian filter to further reduce activation noises. We term this method Token Activation Map (TAM) to highlight the consideration of interactions between tokens. TAM also indicates that it excels at explaining multiple tokens of MLLM, which is different from the Class Activation Map (CAM) for a single prediction. Our TAM method significantly outperforms existing SoTA methods, showcasing high-quality visualization results that can be utilized for various scenarios, such as object localization, failure case analysis, video visualization, MLLMs visual comparison, and model understanding (e.g., color, shape, action, location, visual reasoning, multi-turn conversation, etc). The code is available atgithub.com/xmed-lab/TAM.

Abstract: Reasoning models that produce long, hidden chains of thought have emerged as powerful tools for complex, reasoning-intensive tasks\citep{deepseekai2025deepseekr1incentivizingreasoningcapability, openai2024openaio1card}. However, this paradigm introduces a new user experience challenge: users have little insight into how much time the model will spend reasoning before returning an answer. This unpredictability, can lead to user frustration and is likely to compound as LLMs can produce increasingly long tasks asynchronously \citep{kwa2025measuringaiabilitycomplete}. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate methods for both online and offline prediction of model "thinking time," aiming to develop a practical "progress bar for reasoning." We discuss the implications for user interaction and future research directions.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in Text-to-Image models, many real-world applications require generating coherent image sets with diverse consistency requirements. Existing consistent methods often focus on a specific domain with specific aspects of consistency, which significantly constrains their generalizability to broader applications. In this paper, we propose a more challenging problem, Text-to-ImageSet (T2IS) generation, which aims to generate sets of images that meet various consistency requirements based on user instructions. To systematically study this problem, we first introduce $\textbf{T2IS-Bench}$ with 596 diverse instructions across 26 subcategories, providing comprehensive coverage for T2IS generation. Building on this, we propose $\textbf{T2IS-Eval}$, an evaluation framework that transforms user instructions into multifaceted assessment criteria and employs effective evaluators to adaptively assess consistency fulfillment between criteria and generated sets. Subsequently, we propose $\textbf{AutoT2IS}$, a training-free framework that maximally leverages pretrained Diffusion Transformers' in-context capabilities to harmonize visual elements to satisfy both image-level prompt alignment and set-level visual consistency. Extensive experiments on T2IS-Bench reveal that diverse consistency challenges all existing methods, while our AutoT2IS significantly outperforms current generalized and even specialized approaches. Our method also demonstrates the ability to enable numerous underexplored real-world applications, confirming its substantial practical value.

<title>Not All Explanations for Deep Learning Phenomena Are Equally Valuable</title>

Abstract: Developing a better understanding of surprising or counterintuitive phenomena has constituted a significant portion of deep learning research in recent years. These include double descent, grokking, and the lottery ticket hypothesis -- among many others. Works in this area often develop ad hoc hypotheses attempting to explain these observed phenomena on an isolated, case-by-case basis. This position paper asserts that, in many prominent cases, there is little evidence to suggest that these phenomena appear in real-world applications and these efforts may be inefficient in driving progress in the broader field. Consequently, we argue against viewing them as isolated puzzles that require bespoke resolutions or explanations. However, despite this, we suggest that deep learning phenomena do still offer research value by providing unique settings in which we can refine our broad explanatory theories of more general deep learning principles. This position is reinforced by analyzing the research outcomes of several prominent examples of these phenomena from the recent literature. We revisit the current norms in the research community in approaching these problems and propose practical recommendations for future research, aiming to ensure that progress on deep learning phenomena is well aligned with the ultimate pragmatic goal of progress in the broader field of deep learning.

<title>Objective-Free Local Learning and Emergent Language Structure in Thinking Machines</title>

Abstract: We present a neuro-symbolic framework for generative language modeling based on local, event-driven emergent learning. At its core is a hierarchical Hopfield memory chain acting as a compositional short-term memory and dynamic tokenizer (retokenizer). Rather than relying on predefined tokens or supervision, the model builds structure from scratch, learning symbol sequences as multi-scale representations. It constructs projection tensors that bind co-occurring features into hierarchical tokens, introducing redundancy (i.e an emergent gauge structure) and enabling compression of local activations into long-range dependencies. Curiously, we find that the retokenizer can filter natural language patterns from noise, generating synthetic languages with coherent internal morphology -- quantifiably the same as human language. Language is learned in a local (Hebbian) fashion, where model constraints dictate allowed emergent structure, and new information is retained in alignment with this structure. The absence of a global objective enables a form of plasticity not found in conventional language models, allowing the system to generalize beyond its initial inference class -- even without explicit data. We demonstrate that briefly activating a new neuron during inference binds distributed multi-scale token features into a symbolic embedding. These emergent embedding neurons act as long-term memory and support a key-value mechanism for compositional inference and generalization. This architecture provides a methodological foundation for studying how symbolic structure can emerge from local neural learning. It offers a new pathway for building scalable, interpretable neuro-symbolic systems -- where tokens, grammar, and reasoning arise as compressed memory traces within a Hopfield hierarchy. This approach advances the development of neuromorphic architectures for generative language models.

Abstract: Malware detection in Android systems requires both cybersecurity expertise and machine learning (ML) techniques. Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has emerged as an approach to simplify ML development by reducing the need for specialized knowledge. However, current AutoML solutions typically operate as black-box systems with limited transparency, interpretability, and experiment traceability. To address these limitations, we present MH-AutoML, a domain-specific framework for Android malware detection. MH-AutoML automates the entire ML pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, algorithm selection, and hyperparameter tuning. The framework incorporates capabilities for interpretability, debugging, and experiment tracking that are often missing in general-purpose solutions. In this study, we compare MH-AutoML against seven established AutoML frameworks: Auto-Sklearn, AutoGluon, TPOT, HyperGBM, Auto-PyTorch, LightAutoML, and MLJAR. Results show that MH-AutoML achieves better recall rates while providing more transparency and control. The framework maintains computational efficiency comparable to other solutions, making it suitable for cybersecurity applications where both performance and explainability matter.

Abstract: In the financial industry, data is the lifeblood of operations, and DBAs shoulder significant responsibilities for SQL tuning, database deployment, diagnosis, and service repair. In recent years, both database vendors and customers have increasingly turned to autonomous database platforms in an effort to alleviate the heavy workload of DBAs. However, existing autonomous database platforms are limited in their capabilities, primarily addressing single-point issues such as NL2SQL, anomaly detection, and SQL tuning. Manual intervention remains a necessity for comprehensive database maintenance. GaussMaster aims to revolutionize this landscape by introducing an LLM-based database copilot system. This innovative solution is designed not only to assist developers in writing efficient SQL queries but also to provide comprehensive care for database services. When database instances exhibit abnormal behavior, GaussMaster is capable of orchestrating the entire maintenance process automatically. It achieves this by analyzing hundreds of metrics and logs, employing a Tree-of-thought approach to identify root causes, and invoking appropriate tools to resolve issues. We have successfully implemented GaussMaster in real-world scenarios, such as the banking industry, where it has achieved zero human intervention for over 34 database maintenance scenarios. In this paper, we present significant improvements in these tasks with code at https://gitcode.com/opengauss/openGauss-GaussMaster.

Abstract: Speech codecs serve as bridges between speech signals and large language models. An ideal codec for speech language models should not only preserve acoustic information but also capture rich semantic information. However, existing speech codecs struggle to balance high-quality audio reconstruction with ease of modeling by language models. In this study, we analyze the limitations of previous codecs in balancing semantic richness and acoustic fidelity. We propose XY-Tokenizer, a novel codec that mitigates the conflict between semantic and acoustic capabilities through multi-stage, multi-task learning. Experimental results demonstrate that XY-Tokenizer achieves performance in both semantic and acoustic tasks comparable to that of state-of-the-art codecs operating at similar bitrates, even though those existing codecs typically excel in only one aspect. Specifically, XY-Tokenizer achieves strong text alignment, surpassing distillation-based semantic modeling methods such as SpeechTokenizer and Mimi, while maintaining a speaker similarity score of 0.83 between reconstructed and original audio. The reconstruction performance of XY-Tokenizer is comparable to that of BigCodec, the current state-of-the-art among acoustic-only codecs, which achieves a speaker similarity score of 0.84 at a similar bitrate. Code and models are available at https://github.com/gyt1145028706/XY-Tokenizer.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaboratively training deep learning models across institutions without exchanging sensitive medical data. However, its effectiveness is often hindered by limited data availability and non-independent, identically distributed data across participating clients, which can degrade model performance and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a generative AI based data augmentation framework that integrates synthetic image sharing into the federated training process for breast cancer diagnosis via ultrasound images. Specifically, we train two simple class-specific Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks: one for benign and one for malignant lesions. We then simulate a realistic FL setting using three publicly available breast ultrasound image datasets: BUSI, BUS-BRA, and UDIAT. FedAvg and FedProx are adopted as baseline FL algorithms. Experimental results show that incorporating a suitable number of synthetic images improved the average AUC from 0.9206 to 0.9237 for FedAvg and from 0.9429 to 0.9538 for FedProx. We also note that excessive use of synthetic data reduced performance, underscoring the importance of maintaining a balanced ratio of real and synthetic samples. Our findings highlight the potential of generative AI based data augmentation to enhance FL results in the breast ultrasound image classification task.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable potential for scientific discovery, but their application in domains requiring factual accuracy and domain-specific constraints remains challenging. In molecular design for drug discovery, LLMs can suggest creative molecular modifications but often produce chemically invalid or impractical structures. We present VALID-Mol, a systematic framework for integrating chemical validation with LLM-driven molecular design that increases the rate of generating valid chemical structures from 3% to 83%. Our approach combines methodical prompt engineering, automated chemical validation, and a fine-tuned domain-adapted LLM to ensure reliable generation of synthesizable molecules with improved properties. Beyond the specific implementation, we contribute a generalizable methodology for scientifically-constrained LLM applications, with quantifiable reliability improvements. Computational predictions suggest our framework can generate promising candidates for synthesis with up to 17-fold computationally predicted improvements in target affinity while maintaining synthetic accessibility. We provide a detailed analysis of our prompt engineering process, validation architecture, and fine-tuning approach, offering a reproducible blueprint for applying LLMs to other scientific domains where domain-specific validation is essential.

Abstract: Active learning (AL) has demonstrated remarkable potential in reducing the annotation effort required for training machine learning models. However, despite the surging popularity of natural language generation (NLG) tasks in recent years, the application of AL to NLG has been limited. In this paper, we introduce Active Text Generation (ATGen) - a comprehensive framework that bridges AL with text generation tasks, enabling the application of state-of-the-art AL strategies to NLG. Our framework simplifies AL-empowered annotation in NLG tasks using both human annotators and automatic annotation agents based on large language models (LLMs). The framework supports LLMs deployed as services, such as ChatGPT and Claude, or operated on-premises. Furthermore, ATGen provides a unified platform for smooth implementation and benchmarking of novel AL strategies tailored to NLG tasks. Finally, we present evaluation results for state-of-the-art AL strategies across diverse settings and multiple text generation tasks. We show that ATGen reduces both the effort of human annotators and costs associated with API calls to LLM-based annotation agents. The code of the framework is available on GitHub under the MIT license. The video presentation is available at http://atgen-video.nlpresearch.group

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) is an emerging frontier in robotics, driven by the need for autonomous systems that can perceive, reason, and act in complex physical environments. While single-arm systems have shown strong task performance, collaborative dual-arm systems are essential for handling more intricate tasks involving rigid, deformable, and tactile-sensitive objects. To advance this goal, we launched the RoboTwin Dual-Arm Collaboration Challenge at the 2nd MEIS Workshop, CVPR 2025. Built on the RoboTwin Simulation platform (1.0 and 2.0) and the AgileX COBOT-Magic Robot platform, the competition consisted of three stages: Simulation Round 1, Simulation Round 2, and a final Real-World Round. Participants totally tackled 17 dual-arm manipulation tasks, covering rigid, deformable, and tactile-based scenarios. The challenge attracted 64 global teams and over 400 participants, producing top-performing solutions like SEM and AnchorDP3 and generating valuable insights into generalizable bimanual policy learning. This report outlines the competition setup, task design, evaluation methodology, key findings and future direction, aiming to support future research on robust and generalizable bimanual manipulation policies.

Abstract: We present Federated Timeline Synthesis (FTS), a novel framework for training generative foundation models across distributed timeseries data applied to electronic health records (EHR). At its core, FTS represents patient history as tokenized Patient Health Timelines (PHTs), language-agnostic sequences encoding temporal, categorical, and continuous clinical information. Each institution trains an autoregressive transformer on its local PHTs and transmits only model weights to a central server. The server uses the generators to synthesize a large corpus of trajectories and train a Global Generator (GG), enabling zero-shot inference via Monte Carlo simulation of future PHTs. We evaluate FTS on five clinically meaningful prediction tasks using MIMIC-IV data, showing that models trained on synthetic data generated by GG perform comparably to those trained on real data. FTS offers strong privacy guarantees, scalability across institutions, and extensibility to diverse prediction and simulation tasks especially in healthcare, including counterfactual inference, early warning detection, and synthetic trial design.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are used in a variety of mission-critical roles. Due to the rapidly developing nature of LLMs, there is a lack of quantifiable understanding of the bias and perspective associated with LLM output. Inspired by this need, this paper considers the broader issue of perspective or viewpoint of general text and perspective control of large-language model (LLM) output. Perspective-Dial consists of two main components: a (1) metric space, dubbed Perspective Space, that enables quantitative measurements of different perspectives regarding a topic, and the use of (2) Systematic Prompt Engineering that utilizes greedy-coordinate descent to control LLM output perspective based on measurement feedback from the Perspective Space. The empirical nature of the approach allows progress to side step a principled understanding of perspective or bias -- effectively quantifying and adjusting outputs for a variety of topics. Potential applications include detection, tracking and mitigation of LLM bias, narrative detection, sense making and tracking in public discourse, and debate bot advocating given perspective.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) offer exceptional fidelity for video compression by learning per-video optimized functions, but their adoption is crippled by impractically slow encoding times. Existing attempts to accelerate INR encoding often sacrifice reconstruction quality or crucial coordinate-level control essential for adaptive streaming and transcoding. We introduce SIEDD (Shared-Implicit Encoder with Discrete Decoders), a novel architecture that fundamentally accelerates INR encoding without these compromises. SIEDD first rapidly trains a shared, coordinate-based encoder on sparse anchor frames to efficiently capture global, low-frequency video features. This encoder is then frozen, enabling massively parallel training of lightweight, discrete decoders for individual frame groups, further expedited by aggressive coordinate-space sampling. This synergistic design delivers a remarkable 20-30X encoding speed-up over state-of-the-art INR codecs on HD and 4K benchmarks, while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality and compression ratios. Critically, SIEDD retains full coordinate-based control, enabling continuous resolution decoding and eliminating costly transcoding. Our approach significantly advances the practicality of high-fidelity neural video compression, demonstrating a scalable and efficient path towards real-world deployment.

This paper introduces the Memory Organization-based Generation (MOG) framework, a novel approach to address these challenges by leveraging a hierarchical memory architecture. MOG extracts fine-grained memory units from web documents, recursively organizes them into a Wikipedia-style hierarchical structure, and uses this structure to guide the generation process. This ensures alignment between memory and the article outline, improving both informativeness and verifiability while minimizing hallucinations. Additionally, a citation module is implemented to enhance traceability by linking every generated sentence to specific memory units. Evaluations on our newly created WikiStart dataset demonstrate that MOG outperforms baseline methods in producing informative and reliable articles, making it particularly robust in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: External tool integration through function-calling is essential for practical language model applications, yet most multilingual models lack reliable tool-use capabilities in non-English languages. Even state-of-the-art multilingual models struggle with determining when to use tools and generating the structured outputs required for function calls, often exhibiting language confusion when prompted in lower-resource languages. This work presents a methodology for adapting existing language models to enable robust tool use in any target language, using Bulgarian as a case study. The approach involves continued training of the BgGPT model series (2.6B, 9B, 27B parameters) on a novel bilingual dataset of 10,035 function-calling examples designed to support standardized protocols like MCP (Model Context Protocol). The research introduces TUCAN (Tool-Using Capable Assistant Navigator), which achieves up to 28.75% improvement in function-calling accuracy over base models while preserving core language understanding, as verified on established Bulgarian benchmarks. Beyond accuracy gains, TUCAN models demonstrate production-ready response formatting with clean, parsable function calls, contrasting with the verbose and inconsistent outputs of base models. The models, evaluation framework, and dataset are released to enable replication for other languages. This work demonstrates a practical approach for extending tool-augmented capabilities beyond English-centric systems.

Abstract: Benchmark data sets are a cornerstone of machine learning development and applications, ensuring new methods are robust, reliable and competitive. The relative rarity of benchmark sets in computational science, due to the uniqueness of the problems and the pace of change in the associated domains, makes evaluating new innovations difficult for computational scientists. In this paper a new tool is developed and tested to potentially turn any of the increasing numbers of scientific data sets made openly available into a benchmark accessible to the community. BenchMake uses non-negative matrix factorisation to deterministically identify and isolate challenging edge cases on the convex hull (the smallest convex set that contains all existing data instances) and partitions a required fraction of matched data instances into a testing set that maximises divergence and statistical significance, across tabular, graph, image, signal and textual modalities. BenchMake splits are compared to establish splits and random splits using ten publicly available benchmark sets from different areas of science, with different sizes, shapes, distributions.

<title>TuCo: Measuring the Contribution of Fine-Tuning to Individual Responses of LLMs</title>

Abstract: Past work has studied the effects of fine-tuning on large language models' (LLMs) overall performance on certain tasks. However, a quantitative and systematic method for analyzing its effect on individual outputs is still lacking. Here, we propose a new method for measuring the contribution that fine-tuning makes to individual LLM responses, assuming access to the original pre-trained model. Our method tracks the model's intermediate hidden states, providing a more fine-grained insight into the effects of fine-tuning than a simple comparison of final outputs from pre-trained and fine-tuned models. We introduce and theoretically analyze an exact decomposition of any fine-tuned LLM into a pre-training component and a fine-tuning component. Empirically, we find that model behavior and performance can be steered by up- or down-scaling the fine-tuning component during the forward pass. Motivated by this finding and our theoretical analysis, we define the Tuning Contribution (TuCo) as the ratio of the magnitudes of the fine-tuning component to the pre-training component. We observe that three prominent adversarial attacks on LLMs circumvent safety measures in a way that reduces TuCo, and that TuCo is consistently lower on prompts where these attacks succeed compared to those where they do not. This suggests that attenuating the effect of fine-tuning on model outputs plays a role in the success of such attacks. In summary, TuCo enables the quantitative study of how fine-tuning influences model behavior and safety, and vice versa.

Abstract: Real-world time series often exhibit a non-stationary nature, degrading the performance of pre-trained forecasting models. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this by adjusting models during inference, but existing methods typically update the full model, increasing memory and compute costs. We propose PETSA, a parameter-efficient method that adapts forecasters at test time by only updating small calibration modules on the input and output. PETSA uses low-rank adapters and dynamic gating to adjust representations without retraining. To maintain accuracy despite limited adaptation capacity, we introduce a specialized loss combining three components: (1) a robust term, (2) a frequency-domain term to preserve periodicity, and (3) a patch-wise structural term for structural alignment. PETSA improves the adaptability of various forecasting backbones while requiring fewer parameters than baselines. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that PETSA achieves competitive or better performance across all horizons. Our code is available at: https://github.com/BorealisAI/PETSA

Abstract: As the basis of generative AI, an autoregressive model requires the generation of a new token depending on all the previously generated tokens, which brings high quality but also restricts the model to generate tokens one by one, forming a bottleneck limiting the generation speed. In this paper, we propose a new decoder architecture that efficiently generates text in parallel for context-aware generation tasks. Our proposed pipelined decoder initiates the generation of multiple subsequences simultaneously, and, at each time-step, it generates a new token for each subsequence to realize parallelism. Experiments on multiple text generation tasks, including question answering, text summarization, and keyphrase generation, show that our pipelined decoder significantly improves the generation speed without a significant loss of generation quality or additional memory consumption.

Abstract: Accurate recognition of Emergency Vehicle (EV) sirens is critical for the integration of intelligent transportation systems, smart city monitoring systems, and autonomous driving technologies. Modern automatic solutions are limited by the lack of large scale, curated datasets and by the computational demands of state of the art sound event detection models. This work introduces E2PANNs (Efficient Emergency Pre trained Audio Neural Networks), a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network architecture derived from the PANNs framework, specifically optimized for binary EV siren detection. Leveraging our dedicated subset of AudioSet (AudioSet EV) we fine-tune and evaluate E2PANNs across multiple reference datasets and test its viability on embedded hardware. The experimental campaign includes ablation studies, cross-domain benchmarking, and real-time inference deployment on edge device. Interpretability analyses exploiting Guided Backpropagation and ScoreCAM algorithms provide insights into the model internal representations and validate its ability to capture distinct spectrotemporal patterns associated with different types of EV sirens. Real time performance is assessed through frame wise and event based detection metrics, as well as a detailed analysis of false positive activations. Results demonstrate that E2PANNs establish a new state of the art in this research domain, with high computational efficiency, and suitability for edge-based audio monitoring and safety-critical applications.

Abstract: In this work, we focus on a novel and practical task, i.e., Time-vAriant iMage inPainting (TAMP). The aim of TAMP is to restore a damaged target image by leveraging the complementary information from a reference image, where both images captured the same scene but with a significant time gap in between, i.e., time-variant images. Different from conventional reference-guided image inpainting, the reference image under TAMP setup presents significant content distinction to the target image and potentially also suffers from damages. Such an application frequently happens in our daily lives to restore a damaged image by referring to another reference image, where there is no guarantee of the reference image's source and quality. In particular, our study finds that even state-of-the-art (SOTA) reference-guided image inpainting methods fail to achieve plausible results due to the chaotic image complementation. To address such an ill-posed problem, we propose a novel Interactive Distribution Transition Estimation (InDiTE) module which interactively complements the time-variant images with adaptive semantics thus facilitate the restoration of damaged regions. To further boost the performance, we propose our TAMP solution, namely Interactive Distribution Transition Estimation-driven Diffusion (InDiTE-Diff), which integrates InDiTE with SOTA diffusion model and conducts latent cross-reference during sampling. Moreover, considering the lack of benchmarks for TAMP task, we newly assembled a dataset, i.e., TAMP-Street, based on existing image and mask datasets. We conduct experiments on the TAMP-Street datasets under two different time-variant image inpainting settings, which show our method consistently outperform SOTA reference-guided image inpainting methods for solving TAMP.

<title>Sanitizing Manufacturing Dataset Labels Using Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: The success of machine learning models in industrial applications is heavily dependent on the quality of the datasets used to train the models. However, large-scale datasets, specially those constructed from crowd-sourcing and web-scraping, often suffer from label noise, inconsistencies, and errors. This problem is particularly pronounced in manufacturing domains, where obtaining high-quality labels is costly and time-consuming. This paper introduces Vision-Language Sanitization and Refinement (VLSR), which is a vision-language-based framework for label sanitization and refinement in multi-label manufacturing image datasets. This method embeds both images and their associated textual labels into a shared semantic space leveraging the CLIP vision-language model. Then two key tasks are addressed in this process by computing the cosine similarity between embeddings. First, label sanitization is performed to identify irrelevant, misspelled, or semantically weak labels, and surface the most semantically aligned label for each image by comparing image-label pairs using cosine similarity between image and label embeddings. Second, the method applies density-based clustering on text embeddings, followed by iterative cluster merging, to group semantically similar labels into unified label groups. The Factorynet dataset, which includes noisy labels from both human annotations and web-scraped sources, is employed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the VLSR framework successfully identifies problematic labels and improves label consistency. This method enables a significant reduction in label vocabulary through clustering, which ultimately enhances the dataset's quality for training robust machine learning models in industrial applications with minimal human intervention.

Abstract: Interactive recommendation is a typical information-seeking task that allows users to interactively express their needs through natural language and obtain personalized recommendations. Large language model-powered (LLM-powered) agents have become a new paradigm in interactive recommendations, effectively capturing users' real-time needs and enhancing personalized experiences. However, due to limited planning and generalization capabilities, existing formulations of LLM-powered interactive recommender agents struggle to effectively address diverse and complex user intents, such as intuitive, unrefined, or occasionally ambiguous requests. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel thought-augmented interactive recommender agent system (TAIRA) that addresses complex user intents through distilled thought patterns. Specifically, TAIRA is designed as an LLM-powered multi-agent system featuring a manager agent that orchestrates recommendation tasks by decomposing user needs and planning subtasks, with its planning capacity strengthened through Thought Pattern Distillation (TPD), a thought-augmentation method that extracts high-level thoughts from the agent's and human experts' experiences. Moreover, we designed a set of user simulation schemes to generate personalized queries of different difficulties and evaluate the recommendations based on specific datasets. Through comprehensive experiments conducted across multiple datasets, TAIRA exhibits significantly enhanced performance compared to existing methods. Notably, TAIRA shows a greater advantage on more challenging tasks while generalizing effectively on novel tasks, further validating its superiority in managing complex user intents within interactive recommendation systems. The code is publicly available at:https://github.com/Alcein/TAIRA.

Abstract: Echocardiography is routine for cardiac examination. However, 2D ultrasound (US) struggles with accurate metric calculation and direct observation of 3D cardiac structures. Moreover, 3D US is limited by low resolution, small field of view and scarce availability in practice. Constructing the cardiac anatomical twin from 2D images is promising to provide precise treatment planning and clinical quantification. However, it remains challenging due to the rare paired data, complex structures, and US noises. In this study, we introduce a novel generative framework UltraTwin, to obtain cardiac anatomical twin from sparse multi-view 2D US. Our contribution is three-fold. First, pioneered the construction of a real-world and high-quality dataset containing strictly paired multi-view 2D US and CT, and pseudo-paired data. Second, we propose a coarse-to-fine scheme to achieve hierarchical reconstruction optimization. Last, we introduce an implicit autoencoder for topology-aware constraints. Extensive experiments show that UltraTwin reconstructs high-quality anatomical twins versus strong competitors. We believe it advances anatomical twin modeling for potential applications in personalized cardiac care.

Abstract: This paper introduces Qwen-GUI-3B, a lightweight Vision-Language Model (VLM) specifically designed for Graphical User Interface grounding tasks, achieving performance competitive with significantly larger models. Unlike large-scale VLMs (>7B parameters) that are computationally intensive and impractical for consumer-grade hardware, Qwen-GUI-3B delivers strong grounding accuracy while being fully trainable on a single GPU (RTX 4090). The model incorporates several key innovations: (i) combine cross-platform, multi-resolution dataset of 24K examples from diverse sources including mobile, desktop, and web GUI screenshots to effectively address data scarcity in high-resolution desktop environments; (ii) a two-stage fine-tuning strategy, where initial cross-platform training establishes robust GUI understanding, followed by specialized fine-tuning on high-resolution data to significantly enhance model adaptability; and (iii) data curation and redundancy reduction strategies, demonstrating that randomly sampling a smaller subset with reduced redundancy achieves performance comparable to larger datasets, emphasizing data diversity over sheer volume. Empirical evaluation on standard GUI grounding benchmarks-including ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and the challenging ScreenSpot-Pro, highlights Qwen-GUI-3B's exceptional accuracy, achieving 84.9% on ScreenSpot and 86.4% on ScreenSpot-v2, surpassing prior models under 4B parameters. Ablation studies validate the critical role of balanced sampling and two-stage fine-tuning in enhancing robustness, particularly in high-resolution desktop scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved predictive accuracy. However, modern neural networks remain systematically overconfident, posing risks for deployment in safety-critical scenarios. Current post-hoc calibration methods face a fundamental dilemma: global approaches like Temperature Scaling apply uniform adjustments across all samples, introducing high bias despite computational efficiency, while more expressive methods that operate on full logit distributions suffer from high variance due to noisy high-dimensional inputs and insufficient validation data. To address these challenges, we propose Sample Margin-Aware Recalibration of Temperature (SMART), a lightweight, data-efficient recalibration method that precisely scales logits based on the margin between the top two logits -- termed the logit gap. Specifically, the logit gap serves as a denoised, scalar signal directly tied to decision boundary uncertainty, providing a robust indicator that avoids the noise inherent in high-dimensional logit spaces while preserving model prediction invariance. Meanwhile, SMART employs a novel soft-binned Expected Calibration Error (SoftECE) objective that balances model bias and variance through adaptive binning, enabling stable parameter updates even with extremely limited calibration data. Extensive evaluations across diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate that SMART achieves state-of-the-art calibration performance even with substantially fewer parameters compared to existing parametric methods, offering a principled, robust, and highly efficient solution for practical uncertainty quantification in neural network predictions.

Abstract: Lung magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with ultrashort echo-time (UTE) represents a recent breakthrough in lung structure imaging, providing image resolution and quality comparable to computed tomography (CT). Due to the absence of ionising radiation, MRI is often preferred over CT in paediatric diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF), one of the most common genetic disorders in Caucasians. To assess structural lung damage in CF imaging, CT scoring systems provide valuable quantitative insights for disease diagnosis and progression. However, few quantitative scoring systems are available in structural lung MRI (e.g., UTE-MRI). To provide fast and accurate quantification in lung MRI, we investigated the feasibility of novel Artificial intelligence-assisted Pixel-level Lung (APL) scoring for CF. APL scoring consists of 5 stages, including 1) image loading, 2) AI lung segmentation, 3) lung-bounded slice sampling, 4) pixel-level annotation, and 5) quantification and reporting. The results shows that our APL scoring took 8.2 minutes per subject, which was more than twice as fast as the previous grid-level scoring. Additionally, our pixel-level scoring was statistically more accurate (p=0.021), while strongly correlating with grid-level scoring (R=0.973, p=5.85e-9). This tool has great potential to streamline the workflow of UTE lung MRI in clinical settings, and be extended to other structural lung MRI sequences (e.g., BLADE MRI), and for other lung diseases (e.g., bronchopulmonary dysplasia).

Abstract: Post-training algorithms such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) are widely used to adapt multimodal large language models to downstream tasks. While effective at task adaptation, their impact on prior knowledge remains unclear. In this paper, we introduce jigsaw puzzles as a novel task absent from existing pretraining corpora and systematically study the behavior of SFT and RFT on an open-source multimodal model, Qwen2.5-VL. Our experiments reveal a sharp trade-off: SFT enables rapid task acquisition but leads to catastrophic forgetting, whereas RFT learns more slowly on novel tasks but maintains prior knowledge. We analyze this phenomenon through the lens of learning dynamics, showing that RFT reinforces correct samples that are naturally aligned with the base model's probability landscape, mitigating interference with prior knowledge. Moreover, supervised training on correct RFT-simulated rollouts allows SFT to preserve knowledge while rapidly learning new tasks. These findings suggest that data distribution, rather than algorithmic differences, plays a central role in forgetting, and highlight RFT's potential for stable continual learning in multimodal large language models.

Abstract: Relative localization is a crucial capability for multi-robot systems operating in GPS-denied environments. Existing approaches for multi-robot relative localization often depend on costly or short-range sensors like cameras and LiDARs. Consequently, these approaches face challenges such as high computational overhead (e.g., map merging) and difficulties in disjoint environments. To address this limitation, this paper introduces MGPRL, a novel distributed framework for multi-robot relative localization using convex-hull of multiple Wi-Fi access points (AP). To accomplish this, we employ co-regionalized multi-output Gaussian Processes for efficient Radio Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) field prediction and perform uncertainty-aware multi-AP localization, which is further coupled with weighted convex hull-based alignment for robust relative pose estimation. Each robot predicts the RSSI field of the environment by an online scan of APs in its environment, which are utilized for position estimation of multiple APs. To perform relative localization, each robot aligns the convex hull of its predicted AP locations with that of the neighbor robots. This approach is well-suited for devices with limited computational resources and operates solely on widely available Wi-Fi RSSI measurements without necessitating any dedicated pre-calibration or offline fingerprinting. We rigorously evaluate the performance of the proposed MGPRL in ROS simulations and demonstrate it with real-world experiments, comparing it against multiple state-of-the-art approaches. The results showcase that MGPRL outperforms existing methods in terms of localization accuracy and computational efficiency. Finally, we open source MGPRL as a ROS package https://github.com/herolab-uga/MGPRL.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) often suffers from performance degradation due to key challenges such as data heterogeneity and communication constraints. To address these limitations, we present a novel FL framework called FedWSQ, which integrates weight standardization (WS) and the proposed distribution-aware non-uniform quantization (DANUQ). WS enhances FL performance by filtering out biased components in local updates during training, thereby improving the robustness of the model against data heterogeneity and unstable client participation. In addition, DANUQ minimizes quantization errors by leveraging the statistical properties of local model updates. As a result, FedWSQ significantly reduces communication overhead while maintaining superior model accuracy. Extensive experiments on FL benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedWSQ consistently outperforms existing FL methods across various challenging FL settings, including extreme data heterogeneity and ultra-low-bit communication scenarios.

To address these gaps, we introduce NEU-ESC, a new Vietnamese dataset for Educational Sentiment Classification and Topic Classification, curated from university forums, which offers more samples, richer class diversity, longer texts, and broader vocabulary. In addition, we explore multitask learning using encoder-only language models (BERT), in which we showed that it achieves performance up to 83.7% and 79.8% accuracy for sentiment and topic classification tasks. We also benchmark our dataset and model with other datasets and models, including Large Language Models, and discuss these benchmarks.

Compared to traditional 2D ultrasound (US), 3D US can reconstruct the coronal plane, providing a clear visualization of the uterine morphology for assessing CUAs accurately. In this paper, we propose an intelligent system for simultaneous automated plane localization and CUA diagnosis. Our highlights are: 1) we develop a denoising diffusion model with local (plane) and global (volume/text) guidance, using an adaptive weighting strategy to optimize attention allocation to different conditions; 2) we introduce a reinforcement learning-based framework with unsupervised rewards to extract the key slice summary from redundant sequences, fully integrating information across multiple planes to reduce learning difficulty; 3) we provide text-driven uncertainty modeling for coarse prediction, and leverage it to adjust the classification probability for overall performance improvement. Extensive experiments on a large 3D uterine US dataset show the efficacy of our method, in terms of plane localization and CUA diagnosis. Code is available at https://github.com/yuhoo0302/CUA-US.

Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is a fundamental technique for estimating the state of a quantum system from measured data and plays a crucial role in evaluating the performance of quantum devices. However, standard estimation methods become impractical due to the exponential growth of parameters in the state representation. In this work, we address this challenge by parameterizing the state using a low-rank block tensor train decomposition and demonstrate that our approach is both memory- and computationally efficient. This framework applies to a broad class of quantum states that can be well approximated by low-rank decompositions, including pure states, nearly pure states, and ground states of Hamiltonians.

Abstract: The deployment of robot assistants in large indoor spaces has seen significant growth, with escorting tasks becoming a key application. However, most current escorting robots primarily rely on navigation-focused strategies, assuming that the person being escorted will follow without issue. In crowded environments, this assumption often falls short, as individuals may struggle to keep pace, become obstructed, get distracted, or need to stop unexpectedly. As a result, conventional robotic systems are often unable to provide effective escorting services due to their limited understanding of human movement dynamics. To address these challenges, an effective escorting robot must continuously detect and interpret human actions during the escorting process and adjust its movement accordingly. However, there is currently no existing dataset designed specifically for human action detection in the context of escorting. Given that escorting often occurs in crowded environments, where other individuals may enter the robot's camera view, the robot also needs to identify the specific human it is escorting (the subject) before predicting their actions. Since no existing model performs both person re-identification and action prediction in real-time, we propose a novel neural network architecture that can accomplish both tasks. This enables the robot to adjust its speed dynamically based on the escortee's movements and seamlessly resume escorting after any disruption. In comparative evaluations against strong baselines, our system demonstrates superior efficiency and effectiveness, showcasing its potential to significantly improve robotic escorting services in complex, real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Object detection plays a crucial role in many security-sensitive applications. However, several recent studies have shown that object detectors can be easily fooled by physically realizable attacks, \eg, adversarial patches and recent adversarial textures, which pose realistic and urgent threats. Adversarial Training (AT) has been recognized as the most effective defense against adversarial attacks. While AT has been extensively studied in the $l_\infty$ attack settings on classification models, AT against physically realizable attacks on object detectors has received limited exploration. Early attempts are only performed to defend against adversarial patches, leaving AT against a wider range of physically realizable attacks under-explored. In this work, we consider defending against various physically realizable attacks with a unified AT method. We propose PBCAT, a novel Patch-Based Composite Adversarial Training strategy. PBCAT optimizes the model by incorporating the combination of small-area gradient-guided adversarial patches and imperceptible global adversarial perturbations covering the entire image. With these designs, PBCAT has the potential to defend against not only adversarial patches but also unseen physically realizable attacks such as adversarial textures. Extensive experiments in multiple settings demonstrated that PBCAT significantly improved robustness against various physically realizable attacks over state-of-the-art defense methods. Notably, it improved the detection accuracy by 29.7\% over previous defense methods under one recent adversarial texture attack.

Abstract: Generating radiology reports from CT scans remains a complex task due to the nuanced nature of medical imaging and the variability in clinical documentation. In this study, we propose a two-stage framework for generating renal radiology reports from 2D CT slices. First, we extract structured abnormality features using a multi-task learning model trained to identify lesion attributes such as location, size, enhancement, and attenuation. These extracted features are subsequently combined with the corresponding CT image and fed into a fine-tuned vision-language model to generate natural language report sentences aligned with clinical findings. We conduct experiments on a curated dataset of renal CT studies with manually annotated sentence-slice-feature triplets and evaluate performance using both classification metrics and natural language generation metrics. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms random baselines across all abnormality types, and the generated reports capture key clinical content with reasonable textual accuracy. This exploratory work highlights the feasibility of modular, feature-informed report generation for renal imaging. Future efforts will focus on extending this pipeline to 3D CT volumes and further improving clinical fidelity in multimodal medical AI systems.

Abstract: Diffusion and flow matching models have significantly advanced media generation, yet their design space is well-explored, somewhat limiting further improvements. Concurrently, autoregressive (AR) models, particularly those generating continuous tokens, have emerged as a promising direction for unifying text and media generation. This paper introduces Transition Matching (TM), a novel discrete-time, continuous-state generative paradigm that unifies and advances both diffusion/flow models and continuous AR generation. TM decomposes complex generation tasks into simpler Markov transitions, allowing for expressive non-deterministic probability transition kernels and arbitrary non-continuous supervision processes, thereby unlocking new flexible design avenues. We explore these choices through three TM variants: (i) Difference Transition Matching (DTM), which generalizes flow matching to discrete-time by directly learning transition probabilities, yielding state-of-the-art image quality and text adherence as well as improved sampling efficiency. (ii) Autoregressive Transition Matching (ARTM) and (iii) Full History Transition Matching (FHTM) are partially and fully causal models, respectively, that generalize continuous AR methods. They achieve continuous causal AR generation quality comparable to non-causal approaches and potentially enable seamless integration with existing AR text generation techniques. Notably, FHTM is the first fully causal model to match or surpass the performance of flow-based methods on text-to-image task in continuous domains. We demonstrate these contributions through a rigorous large-scale comparison of TM variants and relevant baselines, maintaining a fixed architecture, training data, and hyperparameters.

Abstract: Recently, forecasting future abnormal events has emerged as an important scenario to tackle real-world necessities. However, the solution of predicting specific future time points when anomalies will occur, known as Anomaly Prediction (AP), remains under-explored. Existing methods dealing with time series data fail in AP, focusing only on immediate anomalies or failing to provide precise predictions for future anomalies. To address the AP task, we propose a novel framework called Anomaly to Prompt (A2P), comprised of Anomaly-Aware Forecasting (AAF) and Synthetic Anomaly Prompting (SAP). To enable the forecasting model to forecast abnormal time points, we adopt a strategy to learn the relationships of anomalies. For the robust detection of anomalies, our proposed SAP introduces a learnable Anomaly Prompt Pool (APP) that simulates diverse anomaly patterns using signal adaptive prompt. Comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of A2P over state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its ability to predict future anomalies. Our implementation code is available at https://github.com/KU-VGI/AP.

<title>Semantic-guided Diverse Decoding for Large Language Model</title>

Abstract: Diverse decoding of large language models is crucial for applications requiring multiple semantically distinct responses, yet existing methods primarily achieve lexical rather than semantic diversity. This limitation significantly constrains Best-of-N strategies, group-based reinforcement learning, and data synthesis. While temperature sampling and diverse beam search modify token distributions or apply n-gram penalties, they fail to ensure meaningful semantic differentiation. We introduce Semantic-guided Diverse Decoding (SemDiD), operating directly in embedding space that balances quality with diversity through three complementary mechanisms: orthogonal directional guidance, dynamic inter-group repulsion, and position-debiased probability assessment. SemDiD harmonizes these competing objectives using adaptive gain functions and constraint optimization, ensuring both quality thresholds and maximal semantic differentiation. Experiments show SemDiD consistently outperforms existing methods, improving Best-of-N coverage by 1.4-5.2% across diverse tasks and accelerating RLHF training convergence by 15% while increasing accuracy by up to 2.1%.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive domains, traditional data privacy measures prove inadequate for protecting information that is implicit, contextual, or inferable - what we define as semantic privacy. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) introduces a lifecycle-centric framework to analyze how semantic privacy risks emerge across input processing, pretraining, fine-tuning, and alignment stages of LLMs. We categorize key attack vectors and assess how current defenses, such as differential privacy, embedding encryption, edge computing, and unlearning, address these threats. Our analysis reveals critical gaps in semantic-level protection, especially against contextual inference and latent representation leakage. We conclude by outlining open challenges, including quantifying semantic leakage, protecting multimodal inputs, balancing de-identification with generation quality, and ensuring transparency in privacy enforcement. This work aims to inform future research on designing robust, semantically aware privacy-preserving techniques for LLMs.

Abstract: Lecture slide element detection and retrieval are key problems in slide understanding. Training effective models for these tasks often depends on extensive manual annotation. However, annotating large volumes of lecture slides for supervised training is labor intensive and requires domain expertise. To address this, we propose a large language model (LLM)-guided synthetic lecture slide generation pipeline, SynLecSlideGen, which produces high-quality, coherent and realistic slides. We also create an evaluation benchmark, namely RealSlide by manually annotating 1,050 real lecture slides. To assess the utility of our synthetic slides, we perform few-shot transfer learning on real data using models pre-trained on them. Experimental results show that few-shot transfer learning with pretraining on synthetic slides significantly improves performance compared to training only on real data. This demonstrates that synthetic data can effectively compensate for limited labeled lecture slides. The code and resources of our work are publicly available on our project website: https://synslidegen.github.io/.

Abstract: The integrity of Water Quality Data (WQD) is critical in environmental monitoring for scientific decision-making and ecological protection. However, water quality monitoring systems are often challenged by large amounts of missing data due to unavoidable problems such as sensor failures and communication delays, which further lead to water quality data becoming High-Dimensional and Sparse (HDS). Traditional data imputation methods are difficult to depict the potential dynamics and fail to capture the deep data features, resulting in unsatisfactory imputation performance. To effectively address the above issues, this paper proposes a Nonlinear Low-rank Representation model (NLR) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for imputing missing WQD, which utilizes CNNs to implement two ideas: a) fusing temporal features to model the temporal dependence of data between time slots, and b) Extracting nonlinear interactions and local patterns to mine higher-order relationships features and achieve deep fusion of multidimensional information. Experimental studies on three real water quality datasets demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art data imputation models in terms of estimation accuracy. It provides an effective approach for handling water quality monitoring data in complex dynamic environments.

Abstract: Mixed Boolean-Arithmetic (MBA) obfuscation protects intellectual property by converting programs into forms that are more complex to analyze. However, MBA has been increasingly exploited by malware developers to evade detection and cause significant real-world problems. Traditional MBA deobfuscation methods often consider these expressions as part of a black box and overlook their internal semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose a truth table, which is an automatically constructed semantic representation of an expression's behavior that does not rely on external resources. The truth table is a mathematical form that represents the output of expression for all possible combinations of input. We also propose a general and extensible guided MBA deobfuscation framework (gMBA) that modifies a Transformer-based neural encoder-decoder Seq2Seq architecture to incorporate this semantic guidance. Experimental results and in-depth analysis show that integrating expression semantics significantly improves performance and highlights the importance of internal semantic expressions in recovering obfuscated code to its original form.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Artificial Intelligence (AI) with significant advancements such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Meta's Llama, and Databricks' DBRX. This paper addresses the cost and scalability challenges encountered when constructing private LLM systems for personal or small group services, as aimed by Apple Intelligence. A Mac Studio cluster with Apple's M2 Ultra chips is established as a cost-efficient solution to host and accelerate the pretrained DBRX model with the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Our performance analysis reveal that parallel execution of the model's experts across two to four machine nodes significantly reduces inference time. We find that computation time for the experts is comparable to the communication time for exchanging their outputs, emphasizing the importance of network latency over bandwidth. We also observe significant management overhead due to Apple software stack's memory management logic. Based on these findings, we develop optimization schemes to eliminate the memory management overhead. As a result, the Mac Studio cluster is 1.15 times more cost-efficient than the state-of-the-art AI supercomputer with NVIDIA H100 GPUs. In addition, we construct a performance model to estimate system performance under varying configurations, and the model provides valuable insights for designing private LLM systems.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in vision-language understanding, yet effectively aligning different modalities remains a fundamental challenge. We present a framework that unifies multimodal understanding by applying byte-pair encoding to visual tokens. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on modality-specific encoders, our method directly incorporates structural information into visual tokens, mirroring successful tokenization strategies in text-only language models. We introduce a priority-guided encoding scheme that considers both frequency and spatial consistency, coupled with a multi-stage training procedure based on curriculum-driven data composition. These enhancements enable the transformer model to better capture cross-modal relationships and reason with visual information. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate improved performance across diverse vision-language tasks. By bridging the gap between visual and textual representations, our approach contributes to the advancement of more capable and efficient multimodal foundation models.

Abstract: As the appearance of medical images is influenced by multiple underlying factors, generative models require rich attribute information beyond labels to produce realistic and diverse images. For instance, generating an image of skin lesion with specific patterns demands descriptions that go beyond diagnosis, such as shape, size, texture, and color. However, such detailed descriptions are not always accessible. To address this, we explore a framework, termed Visual Attribute Prompts (VAP)-Diffusion, to leverage external knowledge from pre-trained Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to improve the quality and diversity of medical image generation. First, to derive descriptions from MLLMs without hallucination, we design a series of prompts following Chain-of-Thoughts for common medical imaging tasks, including dermatologic, colorectal, and chest X-ray images. Generated descriptions are utilized during training and stored across different categories. During testing, descriptions are randomly retrieved from the corresponding category for inference. Moreover, to make the generator robust to unseen combination of descriptions at the test time, we propose a Prototype Condition Mechanism that restricts test embeddings to be similar to those from training. Experiments on three common types of medical imaging across four datasets verify the effectiveness of VAP-Diffusion.

Abstract: The output quality of large language models (LLMs) can be improved via "reasoning": generating segments of chain-of-thought (CoT) content to further condition the model prior to producing user-facing output. While these chains contain valuable information, they are verbose and lack explicit organization, making them tedious to review. Moreover, they lack opportunities for user feedback, such as to remove unwanted considerations, add desired ones, or clarify unclear assumptions. We introduce Interactive Reasoning, an interaction design that visualizes chain-of-thought outputs as a hierarchy of topics and enables user review and modification. We implement interactive reasoning in Hippo, a prototype for AI-assisted decision making in the face of uncertain trade-offs. In a user study with 16 participants, we find that interactive reasoning in Hippo allows users to quickly identify and interrupt erroneous generations, efficiently steer the model towards customized responses, and better understand both model reasoning and model outputs. Our work contributes to a new paradigm that incorporates user oversight into LLM reasoning processes.

Abstract: Modular exponentiation is crucial to number theory and cryptography, yet remains largely unexplored from a mechanistic interpretability standpoint. We train a 4-layer encoder-decoder Transformer model to perform this operation and investigate the emergence of numerical reasoning during training. Utilizing principled sampling strategies, PCA-based embedding analysis, and activation patching, we examine how number-theoretic properties are encoded within the model. We find that reciprocal operand training leads to strong performance gains, with sudden generalization across related moduli. These synchronized accuracy surges reflect grokking-like dynamics, suggesting the model internalizes shared arithmetic structure. We also find a subgraph consisting entirely of attention heads in the final layer sufficient to achieve full performance on the task of regular exponentiation. These results suggest that transformer models learn modular arithmetic through specialized computational circuits, paving the way for more interpretable and efficient neural approaches to modular exponentiation.

Abstract: Multi-bit spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently become a heated research spot, pursuing energy-efficient and high-accurate AI. However, with more bits involved, the associated memory and computation demands escalate to the point where the performance improvements become disproportionate. Based on the insight that different layers demonstrate different importance and extra bits could be wasted and interfering, this paper presents an adaptive bit allocation strategy for direct-trained SNNs, achieving fine-grained layer-wise allocation of memory and computation resources. Thus, SNN's efficiency and accuracy can be improved. Specifically, we parametrize the temporal lengths and the bit widths of weights and spikes, and make them learnable and controllable through gradients. To address the challenges caused by changeable bit widths and temporal lengths, we propose the refined spiking neuron, which can handle different temporal lengths, enable the derivation of gradients for temporal lengths, and suit spike quantization better. In addition, we theoretically formulate the step-size mismatch problem of learnable bit widths, which may incur severe quantization errors to SNN, and accordingly propose the step-size renewal mechanism to alleviate this issue. Experiments on various datasets, including the static CIFAR and ImageNet and the dynamic CIFAR-DVS and DVS-GESTURE, demonstrate that our methods can reduce the overall memory and computation cost while achieving higher accuracy. Particularly, our SEWResNet-34 can achieve a 2.69\% accuracy gain and 4.16$\times$ lower bit budgets over the advanced baseline work on ImageNet. This work will be fully open-sourced.

Abstract: We introduce DABstep, a novel benchmark for evaluating AI agents on realistic multi-step data analysis tasks. DABstep comprises over 450 real-world challenges derived from a financial analytics platform, requiring models to combine code-based data processing with contextual reasoning over heterogeneous documentation. Each task demands an iterative, multi-step problem-solving approach, testing capabilities in data manipulation, cross-referencing multiple sources, and precise result reporting. The benchmark provides a factoid-style answer format with automatic correctness checks for objective scoring at scale. We evaluate leading LLM-based agents, revealing a substantial performance gap: even the best agent achieves only 14.55% accuracy on the hardest tasks. We detail our benchmark's design, dataset composition, task formulation, evaluation protocol, report baseline results and analyze failure modes. DABstep is released with a public leaderboard and toolkit to accelerate research in autonomous data analysis.

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) is widely accessible and radiation-free but has a steep learning curve due to its dynamic nature and non-standard imaging planes. Additionally, the constant need to shift focus between the US screen and the patient poses a challenge. To address these issues, we integrate deep learning (DL)-based semantic segmentation for real-time (RT) automated kidney volumetric measurements, which are essential for clinical assessment but are traditionally time-consuming and prone to fatigue. This automation allows clinicians to concentrate on image interpretation rather than manual measurements. Complementing DL, augmented reality (AR) enhances the usability of US by projecting the display directly into the clinician's field of view, improving ergonomics and reducing the cognitive load associated with screen-to-patient transitions. Two AR-DL-assisted US pipelines on HoloLens-2 are proposed: one streams directly via the application programming interface for a wireless setup, while the other supports any US device with video output for broader accessibility. We evaluate RT feasibility and accuracy using the Open Kidney Dataset and open-source segmentation models (nnU-Net, Segmenter, YOLO with MedSAM and LiteMedSAM). Our open-source GitHub pipeline includes model implementations, measurement algorithms, and a Wi-Fi-based streaming solution, enhancing US training and diagnostics, especially in point-of-care settings.

Abstract: Test-time Adaptation (TTA) adapts a given model to testing domain data with potential domain shifts through online unsupervised learning, yielding impressive performance. However, to date, existing TTA methods primarily focus on single-model adaptation. In this work, we investigate an intriguing question: how does cross-model knowledge influence the TTA process? Our findings reveal that, in TTA's unsupervised online setting, each model can provide complementary, confident knowledge to the others, even when there are substantial differences in model size. For instance, a smaller model like MobileViT (10.6M parameters) can effectively guide a larger model like ViT-Base (86.6M parameters). In light of this, we propose COCA, a Cross-Model Co-Learning framework for TTA, which mainly consists of two main strategies. 1) Co-adaptation adaptively integrates complementary knowledge from other models throughout the TTA process, reducing individual model biases. 2) Self-adaptation enhances each model's unique strengths via unsupervised learning, enabling diverse adaptation to the target domain. Extensive experiments show that COCA, which can also serve as a plug-and-play module, significantly boosts existing SOTAs, on models with various sizes--including ResNets, ViTs, and Mobile-ViTs--via cross-model co-learned TTA. For example, with Mobile-ViT's guidance, COCA raises ViT-Base's average adaptation accuracy on ImageNet-C from 51.7% to 64.5%. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/ycarobot/COCA.

<title>PAC Bench: Do Foundation Models Understand Prerequisites for Executing Manipulation Policies?</title>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly pivotal for generalist robot manipulation, enabling tasks such as physical reasoning, policy generation, and failure detection. However, their proficiency in these high-level applications often assumes a deep understanding of low-level physical prerequisites, a capability that remains largely unverified. For robots to perform actions reliably, they must comprehend intrinsic object properties (e.g., material, weight), action affordances (e.g., graspable, stackable), and physical constraints (e.g., stability, reachability, or an object's state, such as being closed). Despite the widespread use of VLMs in manipulation tasks, we argue that off-the-shelf models may lack this granular, physically grounded understanding, as such prerequisites are often overlooked during training.
  To address this critical gap, we introduce PAC Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate VLMs on their understanding of core Properties, Affordances, and Constraints (PAC) from a task executability perspective. PAC Bench features a diverse dataset with over 30,000 annotations, comprising 673 real-world images (115 object classes, 15 property types, and 1 to 3 affordances defined per class), 100 real-world humanoid-view scenarios, and 120 unique simulated constraint scenarios across four tasks.
  Our evaluations reveal significant gaps in the ability of current VLMs to grasp fundamental physical concepts, highlighting limitations in their suitability for reliable robot manipulation and pointing to key areas for targeted research. PAC Bench also serves as a standardized benchmark for rigorously evaluating physical reasoning in VLMs and guiding the development of more robust, physically grounded models for robotic applications.

Abstract: Solving inverse problems -- recovering signals from incomplete or noisy measurements -- is fundamental in science and engineering. Score-based generative models (SGMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for this task. Two main paradigms have formed: unsupervised approaches that adapt pretrained generative models to inverse problems, and supervised bridge methods that train stochastic processes conditioned on paired clean and corrupted data. While the former typically assume knowledge of the measurement model, the latter have largely overlooked this structural information. We introduce System embedded Diffusion Bridge Models (SDBs), a new class of supervised bridge methods that explicitly embed the known linear measurement system into the coefficients of a matrix-valued SDE. This principled integration yields consistent improvements across diverse linear inverse problems and demonstrates robust generalization under system misspecification between training and deployment, offering a promising solution to real-world applications.

Abstract: Competitive Co-evolutionary Algorithms (CCEAs) are often hampered by complex dynamics like intransitivity and the Red Queen effect, leading to unstable convergence. To counter these challenges, this paper introduces the Marker Gene Method (MGM), a framework that establishes stability by using a 'marker gene' as a dynamic benchmark and an adaptive weighting mechanism to balance exploration and exploitation. We provide rigorous mathematical proofs demonstrating that MGM creates strong attractors near Nash Equilibria within the Strictly Competitive Game framework. Empirically, MGM demonstrates its efficacy across a spectrum of challenges: it stabilizes the canonical Rock-Paper-Scissors game, significantly improves the performance of C-RMOEA/D on ZDT benchmarks, and, when augmented with a Memory Pool (MP) extension, it successfully tames the notoriously pathological Shapley Biased Game. This work presents a theoretically sound and empirically validated framework that substantially enhances the stability and robustness of CCEAs in complex competitive environments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on various tasks, but existing evaluation benchmarks are often static and insufficient to fully assess their robustness and generalization in realistic scenarios. Prior work using evolutionary or adversarial data augmentation has improved evaluation diversity but lacks systematic control over perturbation types and multi-step complexity, limiting comprehensive robustness analysis. To address these gaps, we propose AutoEvoEval, an evolution-based evaluation framework for close-ended tasks such as multi-choice question answering. AutoEvoEval introduces 22 interpretable atomic evolution operations and supports multi-round compositions, enabling controlled generation of diverse, challenging, and realistic test samples. We conduct extensive experiments addressing four research questions on a broad set of open- and closed-source LLMs. Our results show that atomic operations cause an average accuracy drop of 7.283\%, with structure-disrupting or misleading semantic edits causing the largest declines. Model sensitivities vary significantly for the same perturbation, and combining multiple evolution steps amplifies adversarial effects by up to 52.932\%. These findings suggest current benchmarks may overestimate true model generalization and emphasize the need for evolution-aware robustness evaluation. Code and resources are available at: https://github.com/SYSUSELab/AutoEvoEval.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has redefined artificial intelligence (AI), pushing the boundaries of AI research and enabling unbounded possibilities for both academia and the industry. However, LLM development faces increasingly complex challenges throughout its lifecycle, yet no existing research systematically explores these challenges and solutions from the perspective of software engineering (SE) approaches. To fill the gap, we systematically analyze research status throughout the LLM development lifecycle, divided into six phases: requirements engineering, dataset construction, model development and enhancement, testing and evaluation, deployment and operations, and maintenance and evolution. We then conclude by identifying the key challenges for each phase and presenting potential research directions to address these challenges. In general, we provide valuable insights from an SE perspective to facilitate future advances in LLM development.

<title>Multi-Timescale Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Unified Behavior and Control of Autonomous Driving</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is increasingly used in autonomous driving (AD) and shows clear advantages. However, most RL-based AD methods overlook policy structure design. An RL policy that only outputs short-timescale vehicle control commands results in fluctuating driving behavior due to fluctuations in network outputs, while one that only outputs long-timescale driving goals cannot achieve unified optimality of driving behavior and control. Therefore, we propose a multi-timescale hierarchical reinforcement learning approach. Our approach adopts a hierarchical policy structure, where high- and low-level RL policies are unified-trained to produce long-timescale motion guidance and short-timescale control commands, respectively. Therein, motion guidance is explicitly represented by hybrid actions to capture multimodal driving behaviors on structured road and support incremental low-level extend-state updates. Additionally, a hierarchical safety mechanism is designed to ensure multi-timescale safety. Evaluation in simulator-based and HighD dataset-based highway multi-lane scenarios demonstrates that our approach significantly improves AD performance, effectively increasing driving efficiency, action consistency and safety.

<title>Calibrating Graph Neural Networks with Wavelet-Aware Temperature Scaling</title>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong predictive performance on relational data; however, their confidence estimates often misalign with actual predictive correctness, posing significant limitations for deployment in safety-critical settings. While existing graph-aware calibration methods seek to mitigate this limitation, they primarily depend on coarse one-hop statistics, such as neighbor-predicted confidence, or latent node embeddings, thereby neglecting the fine-grained structural heterogeneity inherent in graph topology. In this work, we propose Wavelet-Aware Temperature Scaling (WATS), a post-hoc calibration framework that assigns node-specific temperatures based on tunable heat-kernel graph wavelet features. Specifically, WATS harnesses the scalability and topology sensitivity of graph wavelets to refine confidence estimates, all without necessitating model retraining or access to neighboring logits or predictions. Extensive evaluations across seven benchmark datasets with varying graph structures and two GNN backbones demonstrate that WATS achieves the lowest Expected Calibration Error (ECE) among all compared methods, outperforming both classical and graph-specific baselines by up to 42.3\% in ECE and reducing calibration variance by 17.24\% on average compared with graph-specific methods. Moreover, WATS remains computationally efficient, scaling well across graphs of diverse sizes and densities. Code will be released based on publication.

Abstract: Combining traditional RGB cameras with bio-inspired event cameras for robust object tracking has garnered increasing attention in recent years. However, most existing multimodal tracking algorithms depend heavily on high-complexity Vision Transformer architectures for feature extraction and fusion across modalities. This not only leads to substantial computational overhead but also limits the effectiveness of cross-modal interactions. In this paper, we propose an efficient RGB-Event object tracking framework based on the linear-complexity Vision Mamba network, termed Mamba-FETrack V2. Specifically, we first design a lightweight Prompt Generator that utilizes embedded features from each modality, together with a shared prompt pool, to dynamically generate modality-specific learnable prompt vectors. These prompts, along with the modality-specific embedded features, are then fed into a Vision Mamba-based FEMamba backbone, which facilitates prompt-guided feature extraction, cross-modal interaction, and fusion in a unified manner. Finally, the fused representations are passed to the tracking head for accurate target localization. Extensive experimental evaluations on multiple RGB-Event tracking benchmarks, including short-term COESOT dataset and long-term datasets, i.e., FE108 and FELT V2, demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of the proposed tracking framework. The source code and pre-trained models will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Mamba_FETrack

<title>The Impact of AI on Educational Assessment: A Framework for Constructive Alignment</title>

Abstract: The influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and specifically Large Language Models (LLM), on education is continuously increasing. These models are frequently used by students, giving rise to the question whether current forms of assessment are still a valid way to evaluate student performance and comprehension. The theoretical framework developed in this paper is grounded in Constructive Alignment (CA) theory and Bloom's taxonomy for defining learning objectives. We argue that AI influences learning objectives of different Bloom levels in a different way, and assessment has to be adopted accordingly. Furthermore, in line with Bloom's vision, formative and summative assessment should be aligned on whether the use of AI is permitted or not.
  Although lecturers tend to agree that education and assessment need to be adapted to the presence of AI, a strong bias exists on the extent to which lecturers want to allow for AI in assessment. This bias is caused by a lecturer's familiarity with AI and specifically whether they use it themselves. To avoid this bias, we propose structured guidelines on a university or faculty level, to foster alignment among the staff. Besides that, we argue that teaching staff should be trained on the capabilities and limitations of AI tools. In this way, they are better able to adapt their assessment methods.

Abstract: Human Digital Twins (HDTs) have traditionally been conceptualized as data-driven models designed to support decision-making across various domains. However, recent advancements in conversational AI open new possibilities for HDTs to function as authentic, interactive digital counterparts of individuals. This paper introduces a novel HDT system architecture that integrates large language models with dynamically updated personal data, enabling it to mirror an individual's conversational style, memories, and behaviors. To achieve this, our approach implements context-aware memory retrieval, neural plasticity-inspired consolidation, and adaptive learning mechanisms, creating a more natural and evolving digital persona. The resulting system does not only replicate an individual's unique conversational style depending on who they are speaking with, but also enriches responses with dynamically captured personal experiences, opinions, and memories. While this marks a significant step toward developing authentic virtual counterparts, it also raises critical ethical concerns regarding privacy, accountability, and the long-term implications of persistent digital identities. This study contributes to the field of HDTs by describing our novel system architecture, demonstrating its capabilities, and discussing future directions and emerging challenges to ensure the responsible and ethical development of HDTs.

<title>Do Thinking Tokens Help or Trap? Towards More Efficient Large Reasoning Model</title>

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at solving complex problems but face an overthinking dilemma. When handling simple tasks, they often produce verbose responses overloaded with thinking tokens (e.g., wait, however). These tokens trigger unnecessary high-level reasoning behaviors like reflection and backtracking, reducing efficiency. In this work, our pilot study reveals that these thinking-token-induced behaviors are not essential for effective problem-solving and may even hinder correct reasoning within constrained token budgets. We identify this phenomenon as the thinking trap. To mitigate this issue, we propose Dual Policy Preference Optimization (DuP-PO), a novel algorithm featuring: (1) A rollout sampling strategy that guarantees balanced exposure to responses with and without thinking tokens; (2) A fine-grained advantage control technique to dynamically regulate the prediction of target tokens; (3) A policy shaping method ensuring stable gradient contributions from thinking tokens. Experimental results on five popular math reasoning benchmarks show that DuP-PO performs well on the popular LRM, which significantly improves their token efficiency during reasoning, while achieving superior performance of the base model.

Abstract: While sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have generated significant excitement, a series of negative results have added to skepticism about their usefulness. Here, we establish a conceptual distinction that reconciles competing narratives surrounding SAEs. We argue that while SAEs may be less effective for acting on known concepts, SAEs are powerful tools for discovering unknown concepts. This distinction cleanly separates existing negative and positive results, and suggests several classes of SAE applications. Specifically, we outline use cases for SAEs in (i) ML interpretability, explainability, fairness, auditing, and safety, and (ii) social and health sciences.

Abstract: The analysis of the privacy properties of Privacy-Preserving Ads APIs is an area of research that has received strong interest from academics, industry, and regulators. Despite this interest, the empirical study of these methods is hindered by the lack of publicly available data. Reliable empirical analysis of the privacy properties of an API, in fact, requires access to a dataset consisting of realistic API outputs; however, privacy concerns prevent the general release of such data to the public.
  In this work, we develop a novel methodology to construct synthetic API outputs that are simultaneously realistic enough to enable accurate study and provide strong privacy protections. We focus on one Privacy-Preserving Ads APIs: the Topics API, part of Google Chrome's Privacy Sandbox. We developed a methodology to generate a differentially-private dataset that closely matches the re-identification risk properties of the real Topics API data. The use of differential privacy provides strong theoretical bounds on the leakage of private user information from this release.
  Our methodology is based on first computing a large number of differentially-private statistics describing how output API traces evolve over time. Then, we design a parameterized distribution over sequences of API traces and optimize its parameters so that they closely match the statistics obtained. Finally, we create the synthetic data by drawing from this distribution.
  Our work is complemented by an open-source release of the anonymized dataset obtained by this methodology. We hope this will enable external researchers to analyze the API in-depth and replicate prior and future work on a realistic large-scale dataset. We believe that this work will contribute to fostering transparency regarding the privacy properties of Privacy-Preserving Ads APIs.

Abstract: We study the capabilities of generative autoregressive transformer models trained on large amounts of symbolic solo-piano transcriptions. After first pretraining on approximately 60,000 hours of music, we use a comparatively smaller, high-quality subset, to finetune models to produce musical continuations, perform symbolic classification tasks, and produce general-purpose contrastive MIDI embeddings by adapting the SimCLR framework to symbolic music. When evaluating piano continuation coherence, our generative model outperforms leading symbolic generation techniques and remains competitive with proprietary audio generation models. On MIR classification benchmarks, frozen representations from our contrastive model achieve state-of-the-art results in linear probe experiments, while direct finetuning demonstrates the generalizability of pretrained representations, often requiring only a few hundred labeled examples to specialize to downstream tasks.

Abstract: The chain of thought is fundamental in Transformers, which is to perform step-by-step reasoning. Besides what intermediate steps work, the order of these steps critically affects the difficulty of the reasoning. This study addresses a novel task of unraveling chain of thought - reordering decoder input tokens to a learning-friendly sequence for Transformers to learn arithmetic tasks. The proposed pipeline first trains a Transformer on a mixture of target sequences arranged in different orders and then identifies benign orders as those with fast loss drops in the early stage. As the search space grows factorially with sequence length, we propose a two-stage hierarchical approach for inter- and intra-block reordering. Experiments on four order-sensitive arithmetic tasks show that our method identifies a learning-friendly order out of a few billion candidates. Notably, on the multiplication task, it recovered the reverse-digit order reported in prior studies.

Abstract: Accurate and generalizable object segmentation in ultrasound imaging remains a significant challenge due to anatomical variability, diverse imaging protocols, and limited annotated data. In this study, we propose a prompt-driven vision-language model (VLM) that integrates Grounding DINO with SAM2 to enable object segmentation across multiple ultrasound organs. A total of 18 public ultrasound datasets, encompassing the breast, thyroid, liver, prostate, kidney, and paraspinal muscle, were utilized. These datasets were divided into 15 for fine-tuning and validation of Grounding DINO using Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to the ultrasound domain, and 3 were held out entirely for testing to evaluate performance in unseen distributions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation methods, including UniverSeg, MedSAM, MedCLIP-SAM, BiomedParse, and SAMUS on most seen datasets while maintaining strong performance on unseen datasets without additional fine-tuning. These results underscore the promise of VLMs in scalable and robust ultrasound image analysis, reducing dependence on large, organ-specific annotated datasets. We will publish our code on code.sonography.ai after acceptance.

Abstract: Resin infusion (RI) and resin transfer moulding (RTM) are critical processes for the manufacturing of high-performance fibre-reinforced polymer composites, particularly for large-scale applications such as wind turbine blades. Controlling the resin flow dynamics in these processes is critical to ensure the uniform impregnation of the fibre reinforcements, thereby preventing residual porosities and dry spots that impact the consequent structural integrity of the final component. This paper presents a reinforcement learning (RL) based strategy, established using process simulations, for synchronising the different resin flow fronts in an infusion scenario involving two resin inlets and a single outlet. Using Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO), our approach addresses the challenge of managing the fluid dynamics in a partially observable environment. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the RL approach in achieving an accurate flow convergence, highlighting its potential towards improving process control and product quality in composites manufacturing.

<title>Leveraging the Potential of Prompt Engineering for Hate Speech Detection in Low-Resource Languages</title>

Abstract: The rapid expansion of social media leads to a marked increase in hate speech, which threatens personal lives and results in numerous hate crimes. Detecting hate speech presents several challenges: diverse dialects, frequent code-mixing, and the prevalence of misspelled words in user-generated content on social media platforms. Recent progress in hate speech detection is typically concentrated on high-resource languages. However, low-resource languages still face significant challenges due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets. This paper investigates how we can overcome this limitation via prompt engineering on large language models (LLMs) focusing on low-resource Bengali language. We investigate six prompting strategies - zero-shot prompting, refusal suppression, flattering the classifier, multi-shot prompting, role prompting, and finally our innovative metaphor prompting to detect hate speech effectively in low-resource languages. We pioneer the metaphor prompting to circumvent the built-in safety mechanisms of LLMs that marks a significant departure from existing jailbreaking methods. We investigate all six different prompting strategies on the Llama2-7B model and compare the results extensively with three pre-trained word embeddings - GloVe, Word2Vec, and FastText for three different deep learning models - multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU). To prove the effectiveness of our metaphor prompting in the low-resource Bengali language, we also evaluate it in another low-resource language - Hindi, and two high-resource languages - English and German. The performance of all prompting techniques is evaluated using the F1 score, and environmental impact factor (IF), which measures CO$_2$ emissions, electricity usage, and computational time.

Abstract: As machine learning inferences increasingly move to edge devices, adapting to diverse computational capabilities, hardware, and memory constraints becomes more critical. Instead of relying on a pre-trained model fixed for all future inference queries across diverse edge devices, we argue that planning an inference pattern with a request-specific model tailored to the device's computational capacity, accuracy requirements, and time constraints is more cost-efficient and robust to diverse scenarios. To this end, we propose an accuracy-aware and workload-balanced inference system that integrates joint model quantization and inference partitioning. In this approach, the server dynamically responds to inference queries by sending a quantized model and adaptively sharing the inference workload with the device. Meanwhile, the device's computational power, channel capacity, and accuracy requirements are considered when deciding.
  Furthermore, we introduce a new optimization framework for the inference system, incorporating joint model quantization and partitioning. Our approach optimizes layer-wise quantization bit width and partition points to minimize time consumption and cost while accounting for varying accuracy requirements of tasks through an accuracy degradation metric in our optimization model. To our knowledge, this work represents the first exploration of optimizing quantization layer-wise bit-width in the inference serving system, by introducing theoretical measurement of accuracy degradation. Simulation results demonstrate a substantial reduction in overall time and power consumption, with computation payloads decreasing by over 80% and accuracy degradation kept below 1%.

<title>Adapt Your Body: Mitigating Proprioception Shifts in Imitation Learning</title>

Abstract: Imitation learning models for robotic tasks typically rely on multi-modal inputs, such as RGB images, language, and proprioceptive states. While proprioception is intuitively important for decision-making and obstacle avoidance, simply incorporating all proprioceptive states leads to a surprising degradation in imitation learning performance. In this work, we identify the underlying issue as the proprioception shift problem, where the distributions of proprioceptive states diverge significantly between training and deployment. To address this challenge, we propose a domain adaptation framework that bridges the gap by utilizing rollout data collected during deployment. Using Wasserstein distance, we quantify the discrepancy between expert and rollout proprioceptive states and minimize this gap by adding noise to both sets of states, proportional to the Wasserstein distance. This strategy enhances robustness against proprioception shifts by aligning the training and deployment distributions. Experiments on robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate the efficacy of our method, enabling the imitation policy to leverage proprioception while mitigating its adverse effects. Our approach outperforms the naive solution which discards proprioception, and other baselines designed to address distributional shifts.

Abstract: AI systems increasingly support human decision-making across domains of professional, skill-based, and personal activity. While previous work has examined how AI might affect human autonomy globally, the effects of AI on domain-specific autonomy -- the capacity for self-governed action within defined realms of skill or expertise -- remain understudied. We analyze how AI decision-support systems affect two key components of domain-specific autonomy: skilled competence (the ability to make informed judgments within one's domain) and authentic value-formation (the capacity to form genuine domain-relevant values and preferences). By engaging with prior investigations and analyzing empirical cases across medical, financial, and educational domains, we demonstrate how the absence of reliable failure indicators and the potential for unconscious value shifts can erode domain-specific autonomy both immediately and over time. We then develop a constructive framework for autonomy-preserving AI support systems. We propose specific socio-technical design patterns -- including careful role specification, implementation of defeater mechanisms, and support for reflective practice -- that can help maintain domain-specific autonomy while leveraging AI capabilities. This framework provides concrete guidance for developing AI systems that enhance rather than diminish human agency within specialized domains of action.

<title>ADReFT: Adaptive Decision Repair for Safe Autonomous Driving via Reinforcement Fine-Tuning</title>

Abstract: Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) continue to face safety-critical risks due to the inherent limitations in their design and performance capabilities. Online repair plays a crucial role in mitigating such limitations, ensuring the runtime safety and reliability of ADSs. Existing online repair solutions enforce ADS compliance by transforming unacceptable trajectories into acceptable ones based on predefined specifications, such as rule-based constraints or training datasets. However, these approaches often lack generalizability, adaptability and tend to be overly conservative, resulting in ineffective repairs that not only fail to mitigate safety risks sufficiently but also degrade the overall driving experience. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive Decision Repair (ADReFT), a novel and effective repair method that identifies safety-critical states through offline learning from failed tests and generates appropriate mitigation actions to improve ADS safety. Specifically, ADReFT incorporates a transformer-based model with two joint heads, State Monitor and Decision Adapter, designed to capture complex driving environment interactions to evaluate state safety severity and generate adaptive repair actions. Given the absence of oracles for state safety identification, we first pretrain ADReFT using supervised learning with coarse annotations, i.e., labeling states preceding violations as positive samples and others as negative samples. It establishes ADReFT's foundational capability to mitigate safety-critical violations, though it may result in somewhat conservative mitigation strategies. Therefore, we subsequently finetune ADReFT using reinforcement learning to improve its initial capability and generate more precise and contextually appropriate repair decisions. Our evaluation results illustrate that ADReFT achieves better repair performance.

<title>STCLocker: Deadlock Avoidance Testing for Autonomous Driving Systems</title>

Abstract: Autonomous Driving System (ADS) testing is essential to ensure the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles (AVs) before deployment. However, existing techniques primarily focus on evaluating ADS functionalities in single-AV settings. As ADSs are increasingly deployed in multi-AV traffic, it becomes crucial to assess their cooperative performance, particularly regarding deadlocks, a fundamental coordination failure in which multiple AVs enter a circular waiting state indefinitely, resulting in motion planning failures. Despite its importance, the cooperative capability of ADSs to prevent deadlocks remains insufficiently underexplored. To address this gap, we propose the first dedicated Spatio-Temporal Conflict-Guided Deadlock Avoidance Testing technique, STCLocker, for generating DeadLock Scenarios (DLSs), where a group of AVs controlled by the ADS under test are in a circular wait state. STCLocker consists of three key components: Deadlock Oracle, Conflict Feedback, and Conflict-aware Scenario Generation. Deadlock Oracle provides a reliable black-box mechanism for detecting deadlock cycles among multiple AVs within a given scenario. Conflict Feedback and Conflict-aware Scenario Generation collaborate to actively guide AVs into simultaneous competition over spatial conflict resources (i.e., shared passing regions) and temporal competitive behaviors (i.e., reaching the conflict region at the same time), thereby increasing the effectiveness of generating conflict-prone deadlocks. We evaluate STCLocker on two types of ADSs: Roach, an end-to-end ADS, and OpenCDA, a module-based ADS supporting cooperative communication. Experimental results show that, on average, STCLocker generates more DLS than the best-performing baseline.

Abstract: Large artificial intelligence (AI) models offer revolutionary potential for future wireless systems, promising unprecedented capabilities in network optimization and performance. However, current paradigms largely overlook crucial physical interactions. This oversight means they primarily rely on offline datasets, leading to difficulties in handling real-time wireless dynamics and non-stationary environments. Furthermore, these models often lack the capability for active environmental probing. This paper proposes a fundamental paradigm shift towards wireless embodied large AI (WELAI), moving from passive observation to active embodiment. We first identify key challenges faced by existing models, then we explore the design principles and system structure of WELAI. Besides, we outline prospective applications in next-generation wireless. Finally, through an illustrative case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of WELAI and point out promising research directions for realizing adaptive, robust, and autonomous wireless systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models and vision-language models have led to growing interest in explainable evaluation metrics for image captioning. However, these metrics generate explanations without standardized criteria, and the overall quality of the generated explanations remains unverified. In this paper, we propose EXPERT, a reference-free evaluation metric that provides structured explanations based on three fundamental criteria: fluency, relevance, and descriptiveness. By constructing large-scale datasets of high-quality structured explanations, we develop a two-stage evaluation template to effectively supervise a vision-language model for both scoring and explanation generation. EXPERT achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets while providing significantly higher-quality explanations than existing metrics, as validated through comprehensive human evaluation. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/hjkim811/EXPERT.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used to compute representations of node pairs for downstream tasks such as link prediction. Yet, theoretical understanding of their expressive power has focused almost entirely on graph-level representations. In this work, we shift the focus to links and provide the first comprehensive study of GNN expressiveness in link representation. We introduce a unifying framework, the $k_\phi$-$k_\rho$-$m$ framework, that subsumes existing message-passing link models and enables formal expressiveness comparisons. Using this framework, we derive a hierarchy of state-of-the-art methods and offer theoretical tools to analyze future architectures. To complement our analysis, we propose a synthetic evaluation protocol comprising the first benchmark specifically designed to assess link-level expressiveness. Finally, we ask: does expressiveness matter in practice? We use a graph symmetry metric that quantifies the difficulty of distinguishing links and show that while expressive models may underperform on standard benchmarks, they significantly outperform simpler ones as symmetry increases, highlighting the need for dataset-aware model selection.

Abstract: The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLM) has paved the way for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) paradigms, which integrate visual perception, natural language understanding, and control within a single policy. Researchers in autonomous driving are actively adapting these methods to the vehicle domain. Such models promise autonomous vehicles that can interpret high-level instructions, reason about complex traffic scenes, and make their own decisions. However, the literature remains fragmented and is rapidly expanding. This survey offers the first comprehensive overview of VLA for Autonomous Driving (VLA4AD). We (i) formalize the architectural building blocks shared across recent work, (ii) trace the evolution from early explainer to reasoning-centric VLA models, and (iii) compare over 20 representative models according to VLA's progress in the autonomous driving domain. We also consolidate existing datasets and benchmarks, highlighting protocols that jointly measure driving safety, accuracy, and explanation quality. Finally, we detail open challenges - robustness, real-time efficiency, and formal verification - and outline future directions of VLA4AD. This survey provides a concise yet complete reference for advancing interpretable socially aligned autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: Frontier AI developers are relying on layers of safeguards to protect against catastrophic misuse of AI systems. Anthropic guards their latest Claude 4 Opus model using one such defense pipeline, and other frontier developers including Google DeepMind and OpenAI pledge to soon deploy similar defenses. However, the security of such pipelines is unclear, with limited prior work evaluating or attacking these pipelines. We address this gap by developing and red-teaming an open-source defense pipeline. First, we find that a novel few-shot-prompted input and output classifier outperforms state-of-the-art open-weight safeguard model ShieldGemma across three attacks and two datasets, reducing the attack success rate (ASR) to 0% on the catastrophic misuse dataset ClearHarm. Second, we introduce a STaged AttaCK (STACK) procedure that achieves 71% ASR on ClearHarm in a black-box attack against the few-shot-prompted classifier pipeline. Finally, we also evaluate STACK in a transfer setting, achieving 33% ASR, providing initial evidence that it is feasible to design attacks with no access to the target pipeline. We conclude by suggesting specific mitigations that developers could use to thwart staged attacks.

Abstract: We propose a circuit-level attack, SQUASH, a SWAP-Based Quantum Attack to sabotage Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (HQNNs) for classification tasks. SQUASH is executed by inserting SWAP gate(s) into the variational quantum circuit of the victim HQNN. Unlike conventional noise-based or adversarial input attacks, SQUASH directly manipulates the circuit structure, leading to qubit misalignment and disrupting quantum state evolution. This attack is highly stealthy, as it does not require access to training data or introduce detectable perturbations in input states. Our results demonstrate that SQUASH significantly degrades classification performance, with untargeted SWAP attacks reducing accuracy by up to 74.08\% and targeted SWAP attacks reducing target class accuracy by up to 79.78\%. These findings reveal a critical vulnerability in HQNN implementations, underscoring the need for more resilient architectures against circuit-level adversarial interventions.

Abstract: Blending visual and textual concepts into a new visual concept is a unique and powerful trait of human beings that can fuel creativity. However, in practice, cross-modal conceptual blending for humans is prone to cognitive biases, like design fixation, which leads to local minima in the design space. In this paper, we propose a T2I diffusion adapter "IT-Blender" that can automate the blending process to enhance human creativity. Prior works related to cross-modal conceptual blending are limited in encoding a real image without loss of details or in disentangling the image and text inputs. To address these gaps, IT-Blender leverages pretrained diffusion models (SD and FLUX) to blend the latent representations of a clean reference image with those of the noisy generated image. Combined with our novel blended attention, IT-Blender encodes the real reference image without loss of details and blends the visual concept with the object specified by the text in a disentangled way. Our experiment results show that IT-Blender outperforms the baselines by a large margin in blending visual and textual concepts, shedding light on the new application of image generative models to augment human creativity.

Abstract: Synthetic data has emerged as a cost-effective alternative to real data for training artificial neural networks (ANN). However, the disparity between synthetic and real data results in a domain gap. That gap leads to poor performance and generalization of the trained ANN when applied to real-world scenarios. Several strategies have been developed to bridge this gap, which combine synthetic and real data, known as mixed training using hybrid datasets. While these strategies have been shown to mitigate the domain gap, a systematic evaluation of their generalizability and robustness across various tasks and architectures remains underexplored. To address this challenge, our study comprehensively analyzes two widely used mixing strategies on three prevalent architectures and three distinct hybrid datasets. From these datasets, we sample subsets with varying proportions of synthetic to real data to investigate the impact of synthetic and real components. The findings of this paper provide valuable insights into optimizing the use of synthetic data in the training process of any ANN, contributing to enhancing robustness and efficacy.

<title>On the Predictive Power of Representation Dispersion in Language Models</title>

Abstract: We show that a language model's ability to predict text is tightly linked to the breadth of its embedding space: models that spread their contextual representations more widely tend to achieve lower perplexity. Concretely, we find that representation dispersion - the average pairwise cosine distance among hidden vectors - strongly and negatively correlates with perplexity across diverse model families (LLaMA, Qwen, and others) and domains (Wikipedia, news, scientific abstracts). Beyond illustrating this link, we show how dispersion can be leveraged for a range of practical tasks without requiring labeled data. First, measuring dispersion on unlabeled text allows us to predict downstream accuracy in new domains, offering a data-efficient tool for model selection. Next, we find that identifying layers with higher dispersion pinpoints the best representations for retrieval-based methods such as kNN-LM, bypassing exhaustive layer-by-layer searches. Finally, we integrate a simple push-away objective into training, which increases dispersion in both single-domain and cross-domain scenarios and directly improves perplexity in each.

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images conditioned on text prompts, yet their effectiveness heavily relies on careful guidance during the sampling process. Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) provides a widely used mechanism for steering generation by setting the guidance scale, which balances image quality and prompt alignment. However, the choice of the guidance scale has a critical impact on the convergence toward a visually appealing and prompt-adherent image. In this work, we propose an annealing guidance scheduler which dynamically adjusts the guidance scale over time based on the conditional noisy signal. By learning a scheduling policy, our method addresses the temperamental behavior of CFG. Empirical results demonstrate that our guidance scheduler significantly enhances image quality and alignment with the text prompt, advancing the performance of text-to-image generation. Notably, our novel scheduler requires no additional activations or memory consumption, and can seamlessly replace the common classifier-free guidance, offering an improved trade-off between prompt alignment and quality.

Abstract: Data selection plays a crucial role in data-driven decision-making, including in large language models (LLMs), and is typically task-dependent. Properties such as data quality and diversity have been extensively studied and are known to enhance model performance. However, it remains unclear whether there exist other quantitative and general principles of data selection that can consistently improve performance, especially for complex tasks with limited prior knowledge. In this paper, we demonstrate that selecting more uniformly distributed data can improve training efficiency while enhancing performance. Specifically, we establish that more uniform (less biased) distribution leads to a larger minimum pairwise distance between data points, denoted by $h_{\min}$, and prove that a smaller $h_{\min}$ can slow down the training dynamics of gradient descent (GD). Moreover, we theoretically show that the approximation error of neural networks decreases as $h_{\min}$ increases. Our analysis introduces a convergence framework for GD beyond the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime, applicable to a broad class of architectures, including transformers, without requiring Lipschitz smoothness. This framework further provides theoretical justification for the use of residual connections and function compositions in deep neural architectures. In the end, we conduct comprehensive experiments for supervised fine-tuning across various settings, including different optimization strategies, model sizes, and training datasets. The results consistently demonstrate that selecting data by maximizing pairwise distance significantly accelerates training and achieves comparable or better performance in LLMs across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Residual connection has been extensively studied and widely applied at the model architecture level. However, its potential in the more challenging data-centric approaches remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce the concept of Data Residual Matching for the first time, leveraging data-level skip connections to facilitate data generation and mitigate data information vanishing. This approach maintains a balance between newly acquired knowledge through pixel space optimization and existing core local information identification within raw data modalities, specifically for the dataset distillation task. Furthermore, by incorporating optimization-level refinements, our method significantly improves computational efficiency, achieving superior performance while reducing training time and peak GPU memory usage by 50%. Consequently, the proposed method Fast and Accurate Data Residual Matching for Dataset Distillation (FADRM) establishes a new state-of-the-art, demonstrating substantial improvements over existing methods across multiple dataset benchmarks in both efficiency and effectiveness. For instance, with ResNet-18 as the student model and a 0.8% compression ratio on ImageNet-1K, the method achieves 47.7% test accuracy in single-model dataset distillation and 50.0% in multi-model dataset distillation, surpassing RDED by +5.7% and outperforming state-of-the-art multi-model approaches, EDC and CV-DD, by +1.4% and +4.0%.

Abstract: We argue that many general evaluation problems can be viewed through the lens of voting theory. Each task is interpreted as a separate voter, which requires only ordinal rankings or pairwise comparisons of agents to produce an overall evaluation. By viewing the aggregator as a social welfare function, we are able to leverage centuries of research in social choice theory to derive principled evaluation frameworks with axiomatic foundations. These evaluations are interpretable and flexible, while avoiding many of the problems currently facing cross-task evaluation. We apply this Voting-as-Evaluation (VasE) framework across multiple settings, including reinforcement learning, large language models, and humans. In practice, we observe that VasE can be more robust than popular evaluation frameworks (Elo and Nash averaging), discovers properties in the evaluation data not evident from scores alone, and can predict outcomes better than Elo in a complex seven-player game. We identify one particular approach, maximal lotteries, that satisfies important consistency properties relevant to evaluation, is computationally efficient (polynomial in the size of the evaluation data), and identifies game-theoretic cycles.

Abstract: The question "Can machines think?" and the Turing Test to assess whether machines could achieve human-level intelligence is one of the roots of AI. With the philosophical argument "I think, therefore I am", this paper challenge the idea of a "thinking machine" supported by current AIs since there is no sense of self in them. Current artificial intelligence is only seemingly intelligent information processing and does not truly understand or be subjectively aware of oneself and perceive the world with the self as human intelligence does. In this paper, we introduce a Brain-inspired and Self-based Artificial Intelligence (BriSe AI) paradigm. This BriSe AI paradigm is dedicated to coordinating various cognitive functions and learning strategies in a self-organized manner to build human-level AI models and robotic applications. Specifically, BriSe AI emphasizes the crucial role of the Self in shaping the future AI, rooted with a practical hierarchical Self framework, including Perception and Learning, Bodily Self, Autonomous Self, Social Self, and Conceptual Self. The hierarchical framework of the Self highlights self-based environment perception, self-bodily modeling, autonomous interaction with the environment, social interaction and collaboration with others, and even more abstract understanding of the Self. Furthermore, the positive mutual promotion and support among multiple levels of Self, as well as between Self and learning, enhance the BriSe AI's conscious understanding of information and flexible adaptation to complex environments, serving as a driving force propelling BriSe AI towards real Artificial General Intelligence.

Abstract: In a hyper-relational knowledge graph (HKG), each fact is composed of a main triple associated with attribute-value qualifiers, which express additional factual knowledge. The hyper-relational knowledge graph completion (HKGC) task aims at inferring plausible missing links in a HKG. Most existing approaches to HKGC focus on enhancing the communication between qualifier pairs and main triples, while overlooking two important properties that emerge from the monotonicity of the hyper-relational graphs representation regime. Stage Reasoning allows for a two-step reasoning process, facilitating the integration of coarse-grained inference results derived solely from main triples and fine-grained inference results obtained from hyper-relational facts with qualifiers. In the initial stage, coarse-grained results provide an upper bound for correct predictions, which are subsequently refined in the fine-grained step. More generally, Qualifier Monotonicity implies that by attaching more qualifier pairs to a main triple, we may only narrow down the answer set, but never enlarge it. This paper proposes the HyperMono model for hyper-relational knowledge graph completion, which realizes stage reasoning and qualifier monotonicity. To implement qualifier monotonicity HyperMono resorts to cone embeddings. Experiments on three real-world datasets with three different scenario conditions demonstrate the strong performance of HyperMono when compared to the SoTA.

Abstract: Machines that can replicate human intelligence with type 2 reasoning capabilities should be able to reason at multiple levels of spatio-temporal abstractions and scales using internal world models. Devising formalisms to develop such internal world models, which accurately reflect the causal hierarchies inherent in the dynamics of the real world, is a critical research challenge in the domains of artificial intelligence and machine learning. This thesis identifies several limitations with the prevalent use of state space models (SSMs) as internal world models and propose two new probabilistic formalisms namely Hidden-Parameter SSMs and Multi-Time Scale SSMs to address these drawbacks. The structure of graphical models in both formalisms facilitates scalable exact probabilistic inference using belief propagation, as well as end-to-end learning via backpropagation through time. This approach permits the development of scalable, adaptive hierarchical world models capable of representing nonstationary dynamics across multiple temporal abstractions and scales. Moreover, these probabilistic formalisms integrate the concept of uncertainty in world states, thus improving the system's capacity to emulate the stochastic nature of the real world and quantify the confidence in its predictions. The thesis also discuss how these formalisms are in line with related neuroscience literature on Bayesian brain hypothesis and predicitive processing. Our experiments on various real and simulated robots demonstrate that our formalisms can match and in many cases exceed the performance of contemporary transformer variants in making long-range future predictions. We conclude the thesis by reflecting on the limitations of our current models and suggesting directions for future research.

Abstract: Most constraint-based causal learning algorithms provably return the correct causal graph under certain correctness conditions, such as faithfulness. By representing any constraint-based causal learning algorithm using the notion of a property, we provide a general framework to obtain and study correctness conditions for these algorithms. From the framework, we provide exact correctness conditions for the PC algorithm, which are then related to the correctness conditions of some other existing causal discovery algorithms. The framework also suggests a paradigm for designing causal learning algorithms which allows for the correctness conditions of algorithms to be controlled for before designing the actual algorithm, and has the following implications. We show that the sparsest Markov representation condition is the weakest correctness condition for algorithms that output ancestral graphs or directed acyclic graphs satisfying any existing notions of minimality. We also reason that Pearl-minimality is necessary for meaningful causal learning but not sufficient to relax the faithfulness condition and, as such, has to be strengthened, such as by including background knowledge, for causal learning beyond faithfulness.

Abstract: We introduce CHARTOM, a visual theory-of-mind benchmark designed to evaluate multimodal large language models' capability to understand and reason about misleading data visualizations though charts. CHARTOM consists of carefully designed charts and associated questions that require a language model to not only correctly comprehend the factual content in the chart (the FACT question) but also judge whether the chart will be misleading to a human readers (the MIND question), a dual capability with significant societal benefits. We detail the construction of our benchmark including its calibration on human performance and estimation of MIND ground truth called the Human Misleadingness Index. We evaluated several leading LLMs -- including GPT, Claude, Gemini, Qwen, Llama, and Llava series models -- on the CHARTOM dataset and found that it was challenging to all models both on FACT and MIND questions. This highlights the limitations of current LLMs and presents significant opportunity for future LLMs to improve on understanding misleading charts.

Abstract: Creativity is the ability to produce novel, useful, and surprising ideas, and has been widely studied as a crucial aspect of human cognition. Machine creativity on the other hand has been a long-standing challenge. With the rise of advanced generative AI, there has been renewed interest and debate regarding AI's creative capabilities. Therefore, it is imperative to revisit the state of creativity in AI and identify key progresses and remaining challenges. In this work, we survey leading works studying the creative capabilities of AI systems, focusing on creative problem-solving, linguistic, artistic, and scientific creativity. Our review suggests that while the latest AI models are largely capable of producing linguistically and artistically creative outputs such as poems, images, and musical pieces, they struggle with tasks that require creative problem-solving, abstract thinking and compositionality and their generations suffer from a lack of diversity, originality, long-range incoherence and hallucinations. We also discuss key questions concerning copyright and authorship issues with generative models. Furthermore, we highlight the need for a comprehensive evaluation of creativity that is process-driven and considers several dimensions of creativity. Finally, we propose future research directions to improve the creativity of AI outputs, drawing inspiration from cognitive science and psychology.

Abstract: When considering risky events or actions, we must not downplay the role of involved objects: a charged battery in our phone averts the risk of being stranded in the desert after a flat tyre, and a functional firewall mitigates the risk of a hacker intruding the network. The Common Ontology of Value and Risk (COVER) highlights how the role of objects and their relationships remains pivotal to performing transparent, complete and accountable risk assessment. In this paper, we operationalize some of the notions proposed by COVER -- such as parthood between objects and participation of objects in events/actions -- by presenting a new framework for risk assessment: WATCHDOG. WATCHDOG enriches the expressivity of vetted formal models for risk -- i.e., fault trees and attack trees -- by bridging the disciplines of ontology and formal methods into an ontology-aware formal framework composed by a more expressive modelling formalism, Object-Oriented Disruption Graphs (DOGs), logic (DOGLog) and an intermediate query language (DOGLang). With these, WATCHDOG allows risk assessors to pose questions about disruption propagation, disruption likelihood and risk levels, keeping the fundamental role of objects at risk always in sight.

Abstract: The remarkable performance of the o1 model in complex reasoning demonstrates that test-time compute scaling can further unlock the model's potential, enabling powerful System-2 thinking. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive surveys for test-time compute scaling. We trace the concept of test-time compute back to System-1 models. In System-1 models, test-time compute addresses distribution shifts and improves robustness and generalization through parameter updating, input modification, representation editing, and output calibration. In System-2 models, it enhances the model's reasoning ability to solve complex problems through repeated sampling, self-correction, and tree search. We organize this survey according to the trend of System-1 to System-2 thinking, highlighting the key role of test-time compute in the transition from System-1 models to weak System-2 models, and then to strong System-2 models. We also point out advanced topics and future directions.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in generative AI and large language models (LLMs), have profoundly impacted the creative industries, enabling more innovative content creation, enhancing workflows, and democratizing access to creative tools. This paper explores these technological shifts, with particular focus on how those that have emerged since our previous review in 2022 have expanded creative opportunities and improved efficiency. These technological advancements have enhanced the capabilities of text-to-image, text-to-video, and multimodal generation technologies. In particular, key breakthroughs in LLMs have established new benchmarks in conversational AI, while advancements in image generators have revolutionized content creation. We also discuss the integration of AI into post-production workflows, which has significantly accelerated and improved traditional processes. Once content has been created, it must be delivered to its audiences; the media industry is now facing the demands of increased communication traffic due to creative content. We therefore include a discussion of how AI is beginning to transform the way we represent and compress media content. We highlight the trend toward unified AI frameworks capable of addressing and integrating multiple creative tasks, and we underscore the importance of human insight to drive the creative process and oversight to mitigate AI-generated inaccuracies. Finally, we explore AI's future potential in the creative sector, stressing the need to navigate emerging challenges and to maximize its benefits while addressing the associated risks.

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to understand people's minds based on their behavior, is key to developing socially intelligent agents. Current approaches to ToM reasoning either rely on prompting Large Language Models (LLMs), which are prone to systematic errors, or use handcrafted, rigid agent models for model-based inference, which are more robust but fail to generalize across domains. In this work, we introduce AutoToM, an automated agent modeling method for scalable, robust, and interpretable mental inference. Given a ToM problem, AutoToM first proposes an initial agent model and then performs automated Bayesian inverse planning based on this model, leveraging an LLM backend. Guided by inference uncertainty, it iteratively refines the model by introducing additional mental variables and/or incorporating more timesteps in the context. Across five diverse benchmarks, AutoToM outperforms existing ToM methods and even large reasoning models. Additionally, we show that AutoToM can produce human-like confidence estimates and enable online mental inference for embodied decision-making.

<title>Imitation Learning of Correlated Policies in Stackelberg Games</title>

Abstract: Stackelberg games, widely applied in domains like economics and security, involve asymmetric interactions where a leader's strategy drives follower responses. Accurately modeling these dynamics allows domain experts to optimize strategies in interactive scenarios, such as turn-based sports like badminton. In multi-agent systems, agent behaviors are interdependent, and traditional Multi-Agent Imitation Learning (MAIL) methods often fail to capture these complex interactions. Correlated policies, which account for opponents' strategies, are essential for accurately modeling such dynamics. However, even methods designed for learning correlated policies, like CoDAIL, struggle in Stackelberg games due to their asymmetric decision-making, where leaders and followers cannot simultaneously account for each other's actions, often leading to non-correlated policies. Furthermore, existing MAIL methods that match occupancy measures or use adversarial techniques like GAIL or Inverse RL face scalability challenges, particularly in high-dimensional environments, and suffer from unstable training. To address these challenges, we propose a correlated policy occupancy measure specifically designed for Stackelberg games and introduce the Latent Stackelberg Differential Network (LSDN) to match it. LSDN models two-agent interactions as shared latent state trajectories and uses multi-output Geometric Brownian Motion (MO-GBM) to effectively capture joint policies. By leveraging MO-GBM, LSDN disentangles environmental influences from agent-driven transitions in latent space, enabling the simultaneous learning of interdependent policies. This design eliminates the need for adversarial training and simplifies the learning process. Extensive experiments on Iterative Matrix Games and multi-agent particle environments demonstrate that LSDN can better reproduce complex interaction dynamics than existing MAIL methods.

Abstract: The Semantic Theory of Evolution (STE) takes the existence of a number of arbitrary communication codes as a fundamental feature of life, from the genetic code to human cultural communication codes. Their arbitrariness enables, at each level, the selection of one out of several possible correspondences along with the generation of meaning. STE enables more novelties to emerge and suggests a greater variety of potential life forms.
  With this paper I ground STE on physical theories of meaningful information. Furthermore, I show that key features of the arbitrary communication codes employed by living organisms can be expressed by means of Evidence Theory (ET).
  In particular, I adapt ET to organisms that merely react to sequences of stimuli, explain its basics for organisms that are capable of prediction, and illustrate an unconventional version suitable for the most intricate communication codes employed by humans. Finally, I express the natural trend towards ambiguity reduction in terms of information entropy minimization along with thermodynamic entropy maximization.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) have brought about increasingly capable systems that demonstrate remarkable abilities in reasoning, language understanding, and problem-solving. These advancements have prompted a renewed examination of AI awareness not as a philosophical question of consciousness, but as a measurable, functional capacity. AI awareness is a double-edged sword: it improves general capabilities, i.e., reasoning, safety, while also raising concerns around misalignment and societal risks, demanding careful oversight as AI capabilities grow.
  In this review, we explore the emerging landscape of AI awareness, which includes metacognition (the ability to represent and reason about its own cognitive state), self-awareness (recognizing its own identity, knowledge, limitations, inter alia), social awareness (modeling the knowledge, intentions, and behaviors of other agents and social norms), and situational awareness (assessing and responding to the context in which it operates).
  First, we draw on insights from cognitive science, psychology, and computational theory to trace the theoretical foundations of awareness and examine how the four distinct forms of AI awareness manifest in state-of-the-art AI. Next, we systematically analyze current evaluation methods and empirical findings to better understand these manifestations. Building on this, we explore how AI awareness is closely linked to AI capabilities, demonstrating that more aware AI agents tend to exhibit higher levels of intelligent behaviors. Finally, we discuss the risks associated with AI awareness, including key topics in AI safety, alignment, and broader ethical concerns.

Abstract: This study investigates the self-rationalization framework constructed with a cooperative game, where a generator initially extracts the most informative segment from raw input, and a subsequent predictor utilizes the selected subset for its input. The generator and predictor are trained collaboratively to maximize prediction accuracy. In this paper, we first uncover a potential caveat: such a cooperative game could unintentionally introduce a sampling bias during rationale extraction. Specifically, the generator might inadvertently create an incorrect correlation between the selected rationale candidate and the label, even when they are semantically unrelated in the original dataset. Subsequently, we elucidate the origins of this bias using both detailed theoretical analysis and empirical evidence. Our findings suggest a direction for inspecting these correlations through attacks, based on which we further introduce an instruction to prevent the predictor from learning the correlations. Through experiments on six text classification datasets and two graph classification datasets using three network architectures (GRUs, BERT, and GCN), we show that our method not only significantly outperforms recent rationalization methods, but also achieves comparable or even better results than a representative LLM (llama3.1-8b-instruct).

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown strong capability in enhancing language models' knowledge and reducing AI generative hallucinations, driving its widespread use. However, complex tasks requiring multi-round retrieval remain challenging, and early attempts tend to be overly optimistic without a good sense of self-skepticism. Current multi-round RAG systems may continue searching even when enough information has already been retrieved, or they may provide incorrect answers without having sufficient information or knowledge. Existing solutions either require large amounts of expensive human-labeled process supervision data or lead to subpar performance. This paper aims to address these limitations by introducing a new framework, SIM-RAG, to explicitly enhance RAG systems' self-awareness and multi-round retrieval capabilities. To train SIM-RAG, we first let a RAG system self-practice multi-round retrieval, augmenting existing question-answer pairs with intermediate inner monologue reasoning steps to generate synthetic training data. For each pair, the system may explore multiple retrieval paths, which are labeled as successful if they reach the correct answer and unsuccessful otherwise. Using this data, we train a lightweight information sufficiency Critic. At inference time, the Critic evaluates whether the RAG system has retrieved sufficient information at each round, guiding retrieval decisions and improving system-level self-awareness through in-context reinforcement learning. Experiments across multiple prominent RAG benchmarks show that SIM-RAG is an effective multi-round RAG solution. Furthermore, this framework is system-efficient, adding a lightweight component to RAG without requiring modifications to existing LLMs or search engines, and data-efficient, eliminating the need for costly human-annotated mid-step retrieval process supervision data.

Abstract: LLMs often need effective configurations, like temperature and reasoning steps, to handle tasks requiring sophisticated reasoning and problem-solving, ranging from joke generation to mathematical reasoning. Existing prompting approaches usually adopt general-purpose, fixed configurations that work 'well enough' across tasks but seldom achieve task-specific optimality. To address this gap, we introduce AdaReasoner, an LLM-agnostic plugin designed for any LLM to automate adaptive reasoning configurations for tasks requiring different types of thinking. AdaReasoner is trained using a reinforcement learning (RL) framework, combining a factorized action space with a targeted exploration strategy, along with a pretrained reward model to optimize the policy model for reasoning configurations with only a few-shot guide. AdaReasoner is backed by theoretical guarantees and experiments of fast convergence and a sublinear policy gap. Across six different LLMs and a variety of reasoning tasks, it consistently outperforms standard baselines, preserves out-of-distribution robustness, and yield gains on knowledge-intensive tasks through tailored prompts.

Abstract: As AI models are deployed with increasing autonomy, it is important to ensure they do not take harmful actions unnoticed. As a potential mitigation, we investigate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) monitoring, wherein a weaker trusted monitor model continuously oversees the intermediate reasoning steps of a more powerful but untrusted model. We compare CoT monitoring to action-only monitoring, where only final outputs are reviewed, in a red-teaming setup where the untrusted model is instructed to pursue harmful side tasks while completing a coding problem. We find that CoT monitoring improves detection by up to 27 percentage points in scenarios where action-only monitoring fails to reliably identify sabotage. However, CoT traces can also contain misleading rationalizations that deceive the monitor, reducing performance in more obvious sabotage cases. To address this, we introduce a hybrid protocol that independently scores both reasoning and final outputs and combines them using a weighted average. This hybrid monitor consistently outperforms both CoT and action-only monitors across all tested models and tasks, with detection rates over four times higher than action-only monitoring for subtle deception scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on a range of educational tasks, but are still understudied for their potential to solve mathematical problems. In this study, we compare three prominent LLMs, including GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and Gemini-2.0, on three mathematics datasets of varying complexities (GSM8K, MATH500, and MIT Open Courseware datasets). We take a five-dimensional approach based on the Structured Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) framework to assess final answer correctness, step completeness, step validity, intermediate calculation accuracy, and problem comprehension. The results show that GPT-4o is the most stable and consistent in performance across all the datasets, but particularly it performs outstandingly in high-level questions of the MIT Open Courseware dataset. DeepSeek-V3 is competitively strong in well-structured domains such as optimisation, but suffers from fluctuations in accuracy in statistical inference tasks. Gemini-2.0 shows strong linguistic understanding and clarity in well-structured problems but performs poorly in multi-step reasoning and symbolic logic. Our error analysis reveals particular deficits in each model: GPT-4o is at times lacking in sufficient explanation or precision; DeepSeek-V3 leaves out intermediate steps; and Gemini-2.0 is less flexible in mathematical reasoning in higher dimensions.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems, built upon large language models (LLMs) and deployed in multi-agent configurations, are redefining intelligence, autonomy, collaboration, and decision-making across enterprise and societal domains. This review presents a structured analysis of \textbf{Trust, Risk, and Security Management (TRiSM)} in the context of LLM-based Agentic Multi-Agent Systems (AMAS). We begin by examining the conceptual foundations of Agentic AI and highlight its architectural distinctions from traditional AI agents. We then adapt and extend the AI TRiSM framework for Agentic AI, structured around four key pillars: Governance, Explainability, ModelOps, and Privacy/Security , each contextualized to the challenges of multi-agent LLM systems. A novel risk taxonomy is proposed to capture the unique threats and vulnerabilities of Agentic AI, ranging from coordination failures to prompt-based adversarial manipulation. To support practical assessment in Agentic AI works, we introduce two novel metrics: the Component Synergy Score (CSS), which quantifies the quality of inter-agent collaboration, and the Tool Utilization Efficacy (TUE), which evaluates the efficiency of tool use within agent workflows. We further discuss strategies for improving explainability in Agentic AI , as well as approaches to enhancing security and privacy through encryption, adversarial robustness, and regulatory compliance. The review concludes with a research roadmap for the responsible development and deployment of Agentic AI, outlining critical directions to align emerging systems with TRiSM principles for safe, transparent, and accountable operation.

Abstract: Autonomous UAV operation necessitates reliable mathematical reasoning for tasks such as trajectory planning and power management. While traditional flight control relies on hardcoded equations, recent Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential for more flexible problem-solving but struggle with reliably selecting and applying correct mathematical formulations and executing precise multi-step arithmetic. We propose RAG-UAV, a retrieval-augmented generation framework designed to improve the mathematical reasoning of several LLMs (including GPT o1/Turbo, Llama-3.2/3.3, Mistral, and DeepSeek R1) in UAV-specific contexts by providing access to relevant domain literature. To conduct an initial assessment, we introduce the UAV-Math-Bench, a 20-question problem set of UAV-centric mathematical problems across four difficulty levels. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating retrieval substantially increases exact answer accuracy (achieving up to 75% with o1), reduces instances of incorrect formulation selection (from 25% without RAG to 5\% with RAG), and decreases numerical errors, reducing Mean Squared Error (MSE) by orders of magnitude for the best-performing models. This pilot study indicates that RAG can enable general-purpose LLMs to function as more reliable tools for engineering analysis, although direct real-time flight control requires further investigation and validation on a larger scale. All benchmark data, questions, and answers are publicly available.

Abstract: Existing computer-use agents primarily focus on general-purpose desktop automation tasks, with limited exploration of their application in highly specialized domains. In particular, the 3D building modeling process in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) sector involves open-ended design tasks and complex interaction patterns within Building Information Modeling (BIM) authoring software, which has yet to be thoroughly addressed by current studies. In this paper, we propose BIMgent, an agentic framework powered by multimodal large language models (LLMs), designed to enable autonomous building model authoring via graphical user interface (GUI) operations. BIMgent automates the architectural building modeling process, including multimodal input for conceptual design, planning of software-specific workflows, and efficient execution of the authoring GUI actions. We evaluate BIMgent on real-world building modeling tasks, including both text-based conceptual design generation and reconstruction from existing building design. The design quality achieved by BIMgent was found to be reasonable. Its operations achieved a 32% success rate, whereas all baseline models failed to complete the tasks (0% success rate). Results demonstrate that BIMgent effectively reduces manual workload while preserving design intent, highlighting its potential for practical deployment in real-world architectural modeling scenarios.

Abstract: We present Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (DSAC), a distributional reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that combines the strengths of distributional information of accumulated rewards and entropy-driven exploration from Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. DSAC models the randomness in both action and rewards, surpassing baseline performances on various continuous control tasks. Unlike standard approaches that solely maximize expected rewards, we propose a unified framework for risk-sensitive learning, one that optimizes the risk-related objective while balancing entropy to encourage exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate DSAC's effectiveness in enhancing agent performances for both risk-neutral and risk-sensitive control tasks.

Abstract: The current trend of scaling language models involves increasing both parameter count and training dataset size. Extrapolating this trend suggests that training dataset size may soon be limited by the amount of text data available on the internet. Motivated by this limit, we investigate scaling language models in data-constrained regimes. Specifically, we run a large set of experiments varying the extent of data repetition and compute budget, ranging up to 900 billion training tokens and 9 billion parameter models. We find that with constrained data for a fixed compute budget, training with up to 4 epochs of repeated data yields negligible changes to loss compared to having unique data. However, with more repetition, the value of adding compute eventually decays to zero. We propose and empirically validate a scaling law for compute optimality that accounts for the decreasing value of repeated tokens and excess parameters. Finally, we experiment with approaches mitigating data scarcity, including augmenting the training dataset with code data or removing commonly used filters. Models and datasets from our 400 training runs are freely available at https://github.com/huggingface/datablations.

Abstract: The delicate equilibrium between user privacy and the ability to unleash the potential of distributed data is an important concern. Federated learning, which enables the training of collaborative models without sharing of data, has emerged as a privacy-centric solution. This approach brings forth security challenges, notably poisoning and backdoor attacks where malicious entities inject corrupted data into the training process, as well as evasion attacks that aim to induce misclassifications at test time. Our research investigates the intersection of adversarial training, a common defense method against evasion attacks, and backdoor attacks within federated learning. We introduce Adversarial Robustness Unhardening (ARU), which is employed by a subset of adversarial clients to intentionally undermine model robustness during federated training, rendering models susceptible to a broader range of evasion attacks. We present extensive experiments evaluating ARU's impact on adversarial training and existing robust aggregation defenses against poisoning and backdoor attacks. Our results show that ARU can substantially undermine adversarial training's ability to harden models against test-time evasion attacks, and that adversaries employing ARU can even evade robust aggregation defenses that often neutralize poisoning or backdoor attacks.

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in anomaly detection and run-time monitoring to improve the safety and security of cyber-physical systems (CPS). However, less attention has been paid to hazard mitigation. This paper proposes a combined knowledge and data driven approach, KnowSafe, for the design of safety engines that can predict and mitigate safety hazards resulting from safety-critical malicious attacks or accidental faults targeting a CPS controller. We integrate domain-specific knowledge of safety constraints and context-specific mitigation actions with machine learning (ML) techniques to estimate system trajectories in the far and near future, infer potential hazards, and generate optimal corrective actions to keep the system safe. Experimental evaluation on two realistic closed-loop testbeds for artificial pancreas systems (APS) and a real-world clinical trial dataset for diabetes treatment demonstrates that KnowSafe outperforms the state-of-the-art by achieving higher accuracy in predicting system state trajectories and potential hazards, a low false positive rate, and no false negatives. It also maintains the safe operation of the simulated APS despite faults or attacks without introducing any new hazards, with a hazard mitigation success rate of 92.8%, which is at least 76% higher than solely rule-based (50.9%) and data-driven (52.7%) methods.

Abstract: Video games have served as useful benchmarks for the decision-making community, but going beyond Atari games towards modern games has been prohibitively expensive for the vast majority of the research community. Prior work in modern video games typically relied on game-specific integration to obtain game features and enable online training, or on existing large datasets. An alternative approach is to train agents using imitation learning to play video games purely from images. However, this setting poses a fundamental question: which visual encoders obtain representations that retain information critical for decision making? To answer this question, we conduct a systematic study of imitation learning with publicly available pre-trained visual encoders compared to the typical task-specific end-to-end training approach in Minecraft, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and Minecraft Dungeons. Our results show that end-to-end training can be effective with comparably low-resolution images and only minutes of demonstrations, but significant improvements can be gained by utilising pre-trained encoders such as DINOv2 depending on the game. In addition to enabling effective decision making, we show that pre-trained encoders can make decision-making research in video games more accessible by significantly reducing the cost of training.

<title>Benchmarking Spiking Neural Network Learning Methods with Varying Locality</title>

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), providing more realistic neuronal dynamics, have been shown to achieve performance comparable to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in several machine learning tasks. Information is processed as spikes within SNNs in an event-based mechanism that significantly reduces energy consumption. However, training SNNs is challenging due to the non-differentiable nature of the spiking mechanism. Traditional approaches, such as Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT), have shown effectiveness but come with additional computational and memory costs and are biologically implausible. In contrast, recent works propose alternative learning methods with varying degrees of locality, demonstrating success in classification tasks. In this work, we show that these methods share similarities during the training process, while they present a trade-off between biological plausibility and performance. Further, given the implicitly recurrent nature of SNNs, this research investigates the influence of the addition of explicit recurrence to SNNs. We experimentally prove that the addition of explicit recurrent weights enhances the robustness of SNNs. We also investigate the performance of local learning methods under gradient and non-gradient-based adversarial attacks.

Abstract: The development of AI-assisted chemical synthesis tools requires comprehensive datasets covering diverse reaction types, yet current high-throughput experimental (HTE) approaches are expensive and limited in scope. Chemical literature represents a vast, underexplored data source containing thousands of reactions published annually. However, extracting reaction information from literature faces significant challenges including varied writing styles, complex coreference relationships, and multimodal information presentation. This paper proposes ChemMiner, a novel end-to-end framework leveraging multiple agents powered by large language models (LLMs) to extract high-fidelity chemical data from literature. ChemMiner incorporates three specialized agents: a text analysis agent for coreference mapping, a multimodal agent for non-textual information extraction, and a synthesis analysis agent for data generation. Furthermore, we developed a comprehensive benchmark with expert-annotated chemical literature to evaluate both extraction efficiency and precision. Experimental results demonstrate reaction identification rates comparable to human chemists while significantly reducing processing time, with high accuracy, recall, and F1 scores. Our open-sourced benchmark facilitates future research in chemical literature data mining.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved tremendous success. However, unlike SVMs, which provide direct decision criteria and can be trained with a small dataset, it still has significant weaknesses due to its requirement for massive datasets during training and the black-box characteristics on decision criteria. This paper addresses these issues by identifying support vectors in deep learning models. To this end, we propose the DeepKKT condition, an adaptation of the traditional Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition for deep learning models, and confirm that generated Deep Support Vectors (DSVs) using this condition exhibit properties similar to traditional support vectors. This allows us to apply our method to few-shot dataset distillation problems and alleviate the black-box characteristics of deep learning models. Additionally, we demonstrate that the DeepKKT condition can transform conventional classification models into generative models with high fidelity, particularly as latent generative models using class labels as latent variables. We validate the effectiveness of DSVs using common datasets (ImageNet, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100) on the general architectures (ResNet and ConvNet), proving their practical applicability.

<title>Uncertain Boundaries: Multidisciplinary Approaches to Copyright Issues in Generative AI</title>

Abstract: Generative AI is becoming increasingly prevalent in creative fields, sparking urgent debates over how current copyright laws can keep pace with technological innovation. Recent controversies of AI models generating near-replicas of copyrighted material highlight the need to adapt current legal frameworks and develop technical methods to mitigate copyright infringement risks. This task requires understanding the intersection between computational concepts such as large-scale data scraping and probabilistic content generation, legal definitions of originality and fair use, and economic impacts on IP rights holders. However, most existing research on copyright in AI takes a purely computer science or law-based approach, leaving a gap in coordinating these approaches that only multidisciplinary efforts can effectively address. To bridge this gap, our survey adopts a comprehensive approach synthesizing insights from law, policy, economics, and computer science. It begins by discussing the foundational goals and considerations that should be applied to copyright in generative AI, followed by methods for detecting and assessing potential violations in AI system outputs. Next, it explores various regulatory options influenced by legal, policy, and economic frameworks to manage and mitigate copyright concerns associated with generative AI and reconcile the interests of IP rights holders with that of generative AI producers. The discussion then introduces techniques to safeguard individual creative works from unauthorized replication, such as watermarking and cryptographic protections. Finally, it describes advanced training strategies designed to prevent AI models from reproducing protected content. In doing so, we highlight key opportunities for action and offer actionable strategies that creators, developers, and policymakers can use in navigating the evolving copyright landscape.

Abstract: Autonomous embodied agents live on an Internet of multimedia websites. Can they hop around multimodal websites to complete complex user tasks? Existing benchmarks fail to assess them in a realistic, evolving environment for their embodiment across websites. To answer this question, we present MMInA, a multihop and multimodal benchmark to evaluate the embodied agents for compositional Internet tasks, with several appealing properties: 1) Evolving real-world multimodal websites. Our benchmark uniquely operates on evolving real-world websites, ensuring a high degree of realism and applicability to natural user tasks. Our data includes 1,050 human-written tasks covering various domains such as shopping and travel, with each task requiring the agent to extract multimodal information from web pages as observations autonomously; 2) Multihop web browsing. Our dataset features naturally compositional tasks that require information from or actions on multiple websites to solve, to assess long-range reasoning capabilities on web tasks; 3) Holistic evaluation. We propose a novel protocol for evaluating an agent's progress in completing multihop tasks. We experiment with both standalone (multimodal) language models and heuristic-based web agents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that while long-chain multihop web tasks are easy for humans, they remain challenging for state-of-the-art web agents. We identify that agents are more likely to fail on the early hops when solving tasks with more hops, which results in lower task success rates. To address this issue, we propose a simple memory augmentation approach that replays past action trajectories to reflect. Our method significantly improves the performance of both the single-hop and multihop web browsing abilities. Our code and data are available at github.com/shulin16/MMInA.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have catalyzed significant advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP), yet they encounter challenges such as hallucination and the need for domain-specific knowledge. To mitigate these, recent methodologies have integrated information retrieved from external resources with LLMs, substantially enhancing their performance across NLP tasks. This survey paper addresses the absence of a comprehensive overview on Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs), both Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Retrieval-Augmented Understanding (RAU), providing an in-depth examination of their paradigm, evolution, taxonomy, and applications. The paper discusses the essential components of RALMs, including Retrievers, Language Models, and Augmentations, and how their interactions lead to diverse model structures and applications. RALMs demonstrate utility in a spectrum of tasks, from translation and dialogue systems to knowledge-intensive applications. The survey includes several evaluation methods of RALMs, emphasizing the importance of robustness, accuracy, and relevance in their assessment. It also acknowledges the limitations of RALMs, particularly in retrieval quality and computational efficiency, offering directions for future research. In conclusion, this survey aims to offer a structured insight into RALMs, their potential, and the avenues for their future development in NLP. The paper is supplemented with a Github Repository containing the surveyed works and resources for further study: https://github.com/2471023025/RALM_Survey.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful support tools across various natural language tasks and a range of application domains. Recent studies focus on exploring their capabilities for data annotation. This paper provides a comparative overview of twelve studies investigating the potential of LLMs in labelling data. While the models demonstrate promising cost and time-saving benefits, there exist considerable limitations, such as representativeness, bias, sensitivity to prompt variations and English language preference. Leveraging insights from these studies, our empirical analysis further examines the alignment between human and GPT-generated opinion distributions across four subjective datasets. In contrast to the studies examining representation, our methodology directly obtains the opinion distribution from GPT. Our analysis thereby supports the minority of studies that are considering diverse perspectives when evaluating data annotation tasks and highlights the need for further research in this direction.

Abstract: A thorough understanding of the interaction between the target agent and surrounding agents is a prerequisite for accurate trajectory prediction. Although many methods have been explored, they assign correlation coefficients to surrounding agents in a purely learning-based manner. In this study, we present ASPILin, which manually selects interacting agents and replaces the attention scores in Transformer with a newly computed physical correlation coefficient, enhancing the interpretability of interaction modeling. Surprisingly, these simple modifications can significantly improve prediction performance and substantially reduce computational costs. We intentionally simplified our model in other aspects, such as map encoding. Remarkably, experiments conducted on the INTERACTION, highD, and CitySim datasets demonstrate that our method is efficient and straightforward, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Modern retrieval systems often struggle with upgrading to new and more powerful models due to the incompatibility of embeddings between the old and new models. This necessitates a costly process known as backfilling, which involves re-computing the embeddings for a large number of data samples. In vision, Backward-compatible Training (BT) has been proposed to ensure that the new model aligns with the old model's embeddings. This paper extends the concept of vision-only BT to the field of cross-modal retrieval, marking the first attempt to address Cross-modal BT (XBT). Our goal is to achieve backward-compatibility between Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) models, such as CLIP, for the cross-modal retrieval task. To address XBT challenges, we propose an efficient solution: a projection module that maps the new model's embeddings to those of the old model. This module, pretrained solely with text data, significantly reduces the number of image-text pairs required for XBT learning, and, once it is pretrained, it avoids using the old model during training. Furthermore, we utilize parameter-efficient training strategies that improve efficiency and preserve the off-the-shelf new model's knowledge by avoiding any modifications. Experimental results on cross-modal retrieval datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of XBT and its potential to enable backfill-free upgrades when a new VLP model emerges.

Abstract: Unsupervised fault detection in multivariate time series plays a vital role in ensuring the stable operation of complex systems. Traditional methods often assume that normal data follow a single Gaussian distribution and identify anomalies as deviations from this distribution. {\color{black} However, this simplified assumption fails to capture the diversity and structural complexity of real-world time series, which can lead to misjudgments and reduced detection performance in practical applications. To address this issue, we propose a new method that combines a neighborhood-driven data augmentation strategy with a multi-manifold representation learning framework.} By incorporating information from local neighborhoods, the augmentation module can simulate contextual variations of normal data, enhancing the model's adaptability to distributional changes. In addition, we design a structure-aware feature learning approach that encourages natural clustering of similar patterns in the feature space while maintaining sufficient distinction between different operational states. Extensive experiments on several public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in terms of both accuracy and robustness, showing strong potential for generalization and real-world deployment.

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into software systems has significantly enhanced their capabilities while escalating energy demands. Ensemble learning, combining predictions from multiple models to form a single prediction, intensifies this problem due to cumulative energy consumption. This paper presents a novel approach to model selection that addresses the challenge of balancing the accuracy of AI models with their energy consumption in a live AI ensemble system. We explore how reducing the number of models or improving the efficiency of model usage within an ensemble during inference can reduce energy demands without substantially sacrificing accuracy. This study introduces and evaluates two model selection strategies, Static and Dynamic, for optimizing ensemble learning systems performance while minimizing energy usage. Our results demonstrate that the Static strategy improves the F1 score beyond the baseline, reducing average energy usage from 100% from the full ensemble to 62%. The Dynamic strategy further enhances F1 scores, using on average 76% compared to 100% of the full ensemble. Moreover, we propose an approach that balances accuracy with resource consumption, significantly reducing energy usage without substantially impacting accuracy. This method decreased the average energy usage of the Static strategy from approximately 62% to 14%, and for the Dynamic strategy, from around 76% to 57%. Our field study of Green AI using an operational AI system developed by a large professional services provider shows the practical applicability of adopting energy-conscious model selection strategies in live production environments.

Abstract: Traffic incidents involving vulnerable road users (VRUs) constitute a significant proportion of global road accidents. Advances in traffic communication ecosystems, coupled with sophisticated signal processing and machine learning techniques, have facilitated the utilization of data from diverse sensors. Despite these advancements and the availability of extensive datasets, substantial progress is required to mitigate traffic casualties. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art technologies and methodologies to enhance the safety of VRUs. The study investigates the communication networks between vehicles and VRUs, emphasizing the integration of advanced sensors and the availability of relevant datasets. It explores preprocessing techniques and data fusion methods to enhance sensor data quality. Furthermore, our study assesses critical simulation environments essential for developing and testing VRU safety systems. Our research also highlights recent advances in VRU detection and classification algorithms, addressing challenges such as variable environmental conditions. Additionally, we cover cutting-edge research in predicting VRU intentions and behaviors, which is mandatory for proactive collision avoidance strategies. Through this survey, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current landscape of VRU safety technologies, identifying areas of progress and areas needing further research and development.

Abstract: Image composition and generation are processes where the artists need control over various parts of the generated images. However, the current state-of-the-art generation models, like Stable Diffusion, cannot handle fine-grained part-level attributes in the text prompts. Specifically, when additional attribute details are added to the base text prompt, these text-to-image models either generate an image vastly different from the image generated from the base prompt or ignore the attribute details. To mitigate these issues, we introduce PartComposer, a training-free method that enables image generation based on fine-grained part-level attributes specified for objects in the base text prompt. This allows more control for artists and enables novel object compositions by combining distinctive object parts. PartComposer first localizes object parts by denoising the object region from a specific diffusion process. This enables each part token to be localized to the right region. After obtaining part masks, we run a localized diffusion process in each part region based on fine-grained part attributes and combine them to produce the final image. All stages of PartComposer are based on repurposing a pre-trained diffusion model, which enables it to generalize across domains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of part-level control provided by PartComposer through qualitative visual examples and quantitative comparisons with contemporary baselines.

Abstract: Differentiable Search Index (DSI) utilizes pre-trained language models to perform indexing and document retrieval via end-to-end learning without relying on external indexes. However, DSI requires full re-training to index new documents, causing significant computational inefficiencies. Continual learning (CL) offers a solution by enabling the model to incrementally update without full re-training. Existing CL solutions in document retrieval rely on memory buffers or generative models for rehearsal, which is infeasible when accessing previous training data is restricted due to privacy concerns. To this end, we introduce PromptDSI, a prompt-based, rehearsal-free continual learning approach for document retrieval. PromptDSI follows the Prompt-based Continual Learning (PCL) framework, using learnable prompts to efficiently index new documents without accessing previous documents or queries. To improve retrieval latency, we remove the initial forward pass of PCL, which otherwise greatly increases training and inference time, with a negligible trade-off in performance. Additionally, we introduce a novel topic-aware prompt pool that employs neural topic embeddings as fixed keys, eliminating the instability of prompt key optimization while maintaining competitive performance with existing PCL prompt pools. In a challenging rehearsal-free continual learning setup, we demonstrate that PromptDSI variants outperform rehearsal-based baselines, match the strong cache-based baseline in mitigating forgetting, and significantly improving retrieval performance on new corpora.

<title>Ego-Foresight: Self-supervised Learning of Agent-Aware Representations for Improved RL</title>

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements in Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) observed in the last decade, the amount of training experience necessary to learn effective policies remains one of the primary concerns both in simulated and real environments. Looking to solve this issue, previous work has shown that improved training efficiency can be achieved by separately modeling agent and environment, but usually requiring a supervisory agent mask.
  In contrast to RL, humans can perfect a new skill from a small number of trials and in most cases do so without a supervisory signal, making neuroscientific studies of human development a valuable source of inspiration for RL. In particular, we explore the idea of motor prediction, which states that humans develop an internal model of themselves and of the consequences that their motor commands have on the immediate sensory inputs. Our insight is that the movement of the agent provides a cue that allows the duality between agent and environment to be learned.
  To instantiate this idea, we present Ego-Foresight, a self-supervised method for disentangling agent and environment based on motion and prediction. Our main finding is self-supervised agent-awareness by visuomotor prediction of the agent improves sample-efficiency and performance of the underlying RL algorithm.
  To test our approach, we first study its ability to visually predict agent movement irrespective of the environment, in simulated and real-world robotic data. Then, we integrate Ego-Foresight with a model-free RL algorithm to solve simulated robotic tasks, showing that self-supervised agent-awareness can improve sample-efficiency and performance in RL.

<title>Understanding and Reducing the Class-Dependent Effects of Data Augmentation with A Two-Player Game Approach</title>

Abstract: Data augmentation is widely applied and has shown its benefits in different machine learning tasks. However, as recently observed, it may have an unfair effect in multi-class classification. While data augmentation generally improves the overall performance (and therefore is beneficial for many classes), it can actually be detrimental for other classes, which can be problematic in some application domains. In this paper, to counteract this phenomenon, we propose CLAM, a CLAss-dependent Multiplicative-weights method. To derive it, we first formulate the training of a classifier as a non-linear optimization problem that aims at simultaneously maximizing the individual class performances and balancing them. By rewriting this optimization problem as an adversarial two-player game, we propose a novel multiplicative weight algorithm, for which we prove the convergence. Interestingly, our formulation also reveals that the class-dependent effects of data augmentation is not due to data augmentation only, but is in fact a general phenomenon. Our empirical results over six datasets demonstrate that the performance of learned classifiers is indeed more fairly distributed over classes, with only limited impact on the average accuracy.

Abstract: Illustration is a fundamental mode of human expression and communication. Certain types of motion that accompany speech can provide this illustrative mode of communication. While Augmented and Virtual Reality technologies (AR/VR) have introduced tools for producing drawings with hand motions (air drawing), they typically require costly hardware and additional digital markers, thereby limiting their accessibility and portability. Furthermore, air drawing demands considerable skill to achieve aesthetic results. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of AirSketch, aimed at generating faithful and visually coherent sketches directly from hand motions, eliminating the need for complicated headsets or markers. We devise a simple augmentation-based self-supervised training procedure, enabling a controllable image diffusion model to learn to translate from highly noisy hand tracking images to clean, aesthetically pleasing sketches, while preserving the essential visual cues from the original tracking data. We present two air drawing datasets to study this problem. Our findings demonstrate that beyond producing photo-realistic images from precise spatial inputs, controllable image diffusion can effectively produce a refined, clear sketch from a noisy input. Our work serves as an initial step towards marker-less air drawing and reveals distinct applications of controllable diffusion models to AirSketch and AR/VR in general.

Abstract: Learning dynamics, which describes how the learning of specific training examples influences the model's predictions on other examples, gives us a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of deep learning systems. We study the learning dynamics of large language models during different types of finetuning, by analyzing the step-wise decomposition of how influence accumulates among different potential responses. Our framework allows a uniform interpretation of many interesting observations about the training of popular algorithms for both instruction tuning and preference tuning. In particular, we propose a hypothetical explanation of why specific types of hallucination are strengthened after finetuning, e.g., the model might use phrases or facts in the response for question B to answer question A, or the model might keep repeating similar simple phrases when generating responses. We also extend our framework and highlight a unique "squeezing effect" to explain a previously observed phenomenon in off-policy direct preference optimization (DPO), where running DPO for too long makes even the desired outputs less likely. This framework also provides insights into where the benefits of on-policy DPO and other variants come from. The analysis not only provides a novel perspective of understanding LLM's finetuning but also inspires a simple, effective method to improve alignment performance.

Abstract: Queries to large language models (LLMs) can be divided into two parts: the instruction/question and the accompanying context. The context for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems in most benchmarks comes from Wikipedia-like texts written in a neutral and factual tone. However, real-world RAG applications often retrieve internet-based text with diverse tones and linguistic styles, posing challenges for downstream tasks. This paper introduces (a) a dataset that transforms RAG-retrieved passages into emotionally inflected and sarcastic text, (b) an emotion translation model for adapting text to different tones, and (c) a prompt-based method to improve LLMs' pragmatic interpretation of retrieved text.

Abstract: When symmetry is present in the loss function, the model is likely to be trapped in a low-capacity state that is sometimes known as a "collapse". Being trapped in these low-capacity states can be a major obstacle to training across many scenarios where deep learning technology is applied. We first prove two concrete mechanisms through which symmetries lead to reduced capacities and ignored features during training and inference. We then propose a simple and theoretically justified algorithm, syre, to remove almost all symmetry-induced low-capacity states in neural networks. When this type of entrapment is especially a concern, removing symmetries with the proposed method is shown to correlate well with improved optimization or performance. A remarkable merit of the proposed method is that it is model-agnostic and does not require any knowledge of the symmetry.

<title>S^3cMath: Spontaneous Step-level Self-correction Makes Large Language Models Better Mathematical Reasoners</title>

Abstract: Self-correction is a novel method that can stimulate the potential reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). It involves detecting and correcting errors during the inference process when LLMs solve reasoning problems. However, recent works do not regard self-correction as a spontaneous and intrinsic capability of LLMs. Instead, such correction is achieved through post-hoc generation, external knowledge introduction, multi-model collaboration, and similar techniques. In this paper, we propose a series of mathematical LLMs called S$^3$c-Math, which are able to perform Spontaneous Step-level Self-correction for Mathematical reasoning. This capability helps LLMs to recognize whether their ongoing inference tends to contain errors and simultaneously correct these errors to produce a more reliable response. We proposed a method, which employs a step-level sampling approach to construct step-wise self-correction data for achieving such ability. Additionally, we implement a training strategy that uses above constructed data to equip LLMs with spontaneous step-level self-correction capacities. Our data and methods have been demonstrated to be effective across various foundation LLMs, consistently showing significant progress in evaluations on GSM8K, MATH, and other mathematical benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce the spontaneous step-level self-correction ability of LLMs in mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: From the invention of writing and the printing press, to television and social media, human history is punctuated by major innovations in communication technology, which fundamentally altered how ideas spread and reshaped our culture. Recent chatbots powered by generative artificial intelligence constitute a novel medium that encodes cultural patterns in their neural representations and disseminates them in conversations with hundreds of millions of people. Understanding whether these patterns transmit into human language, and ultimately shape human culture, is a fundamental question. While fully quantifying the causal impact of a chatbot like ChatGPT on human culture is very challenging, lexicographic shift in human spoken communication may offer an early indicator of such broad phenomenon. Here, we apply econometric causal inference techniques to 740,249 hours of human discourse from 360,445 YouTube academic talks and 771,591 conversational podcast episodes across multiple disciplines. We detect a measurable and abrupt increase in the use of words preferentially generated by ChatGPT, such as delve, comprehend, boast, swift, and meticulous, after its release. These findings suggest a scenario where machines, originally trained on human data and subsequently exhibiting their own cultural traits, can, in turn, measurably reshape human culture. This marks the beginning of a closed cultural feedback loop in which cultural traits circulate bidirectionally between humans and machines. Our results motivate further research into the evolution of human-machine culture, and raise concerns over the erosion of linguistic and cultural diversity, and the risks of scalable manipulation.

Abstract: Learning representations for structured data with certain geometries (e.g., observed or unobserved) is a fundamental challenge, wherein message passing neural networks (MPNNs) have become a de facto class of model solutions. In this paper, inspired by physical systems, we propose an energy-constrained diffusion model, which combines the inductive bias of diffusion on manifolds with layer-wise constraints of energy minimization. We identify that the diffusion operators have a one-to-one correspondence with the energy functions implicitly descended by the diffusion process, and the finite-difference iteration for solving the energy-constrained diffusion system induces the propagation layers of various types of MPNNs operating on observed or latent structures. This leads to a unified mathematical framework for common neural architectures whose computational flows can be cast as message passing (or its special case), including MLPs, GNNs, and Transformers. Building on these insights, we devise a new class of neural message passing models, dubbed diffusion-inspired Transformers, whose global attention layers are derived from the principled energy-constrained diffusion framework. Across diverse datasets ranging from real-world networks to images, texts, and physical particles, we demonstrate that the new model achieves promising performance in scenarios where the data structures are observed (as a graph), partially observed, or entirely unobserved.

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) today may not necessarily provide culturally appropriate and relevant responses to its Filipino users. We introduce Kalahi, a cultural LLM evaluation suite collaboratively created by native Filipino speakers. It is composed of 150 high-quality, handcrafted and nuanced prompts that test LLMs for generations that are relevant to shared Filipino cultural knowledge and values. Strong LLM performance in Kalahi indicates a model's ability to generate responses similar to what an average Filipino would say or do in a given situation. We conducted experiments on LLMs with multilingual and Filipino language support. Results show that Kalahi, while trivial for Filipinos, is challenging for LLMs, with the best model answering only 46.0% of the questions correctly compared to native Filipino performance of 89.10%. Thus, Kalahi can be used to accurately and reliably evaluate Filipino cultural representation in LLMs.

Abstract: Deep multimodal learning has shown remarkable success by leveraging contrastive learning to capture explicit one-to-one relations across modalities. However, real-world data often exhibits shared relations beyond simple pairwise associations. We propose M3CoL, a Multimodal Mixup Contrastive Learning approach to capture nuanced shared relations inherent in multimodal data. Our key contribution is a Mixup-based contrastive loss that learns robust representations by aligning mixed samples from one modality with their corresponding samples from other modalities thereby capturing shared relations between them. For multimodal classification tasks, we introduce a framework that integrates a fusion module with unimodal prediction modules for auxiliary supervision during training, complemented by our proposed Mixup-based contrastive loss. Through extensive experiments on diverse datasets (N24News, ROSMAP, BRCA, and Food-101), we demonstrate that M3CoL effectively captures shared multimodal relations and generalizes across domains. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods on N24News, ROSMAP, and BRCA, while achieving comparable performance on Food-101. Our work highlights the significance of learning shared relations for robust multimodal learning, opening up promising avenues for future research. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/RaghavSinghal10/M3CoL.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of particular data points from the learnable parameters of a trained machine learning model. This is a crucial capability in light of data privacy requirements, trustworthiness, and safety in deployed models. MU is particularly challenging for deep neural networks (DNNs), such as convolutional nets or vision transformers, as such DNNs tend to memorize a notable portion of their training dataset. Nevertheless, the community lacks a rigorous and multifaceted study that looks into the success of MU methods for DNNs. In this paper, we investigate 18 state-of-the-art MU methods across various benchmark datasets and models, with each evaluation conducted over 10 different initializations, a comprehensive evaluation involving MU over 100K models. We show that, with the proper hyperparameters, Masked Small Gradients (MSG) and Convolution Transpose (CT), consistently perform better in terms of model accuracy and run-time efficiency across different models, datasets, and initializations, assessed by population-based membership inference attacks (MIA) and per-sample unlearning likelihood ratio attacks (U-LiRA). Furthermore, our benchmark highlights the fact that comparing a MU method only with commonly used baselines, such as Gradient Ascent (GA) or Successive Random Relabeling (SRL), is inadequate, and we need better baselines like Negative Gradient Plus (NG+) with proper hyperparameter selection.

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization abilities in mathematics and logical reasoning tasks. Prior research indicates that LLMs pre-trained with programming language data exhibit high mathematical and reasoning abilities; however, this causal relationship has not been rigorously tested. Our research aims to verify which programming languages and features during pre-training affect logical inference performance. Specifically, we pre-trained decoder-based language models from scratch using datasets from ten programming languages (e.g., Python, C, Java) and three natural language datasets (Wikipedia, Fineweb, C4) under identical conditions. Thereafter, we evaluated the trained models in a few-shot in-context learning setting on logical reasoning tasks: FLD and bAbi, which do not require commonsense or world knowledge. The results demonstrate that nearly all models trained with programming languages consistently outperform those trained with natural languages, indicating that programming languages contain factors that elicit logic inference performance. In addition, we found that models trained with programming languages exhibit a better ability to follow instructions compared to those trained with natural languages. Further analysis reveals that the depth of Abstract Syntax Trees representing parsed results of programs also affects logical reasoning performance. These findings will offer insights into the essential elements of pre-training for acquiring the foundational abilities of LLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) exhibit promising advancements across various tasks, yet they still encounter significant trustworthiness issues. Prior studies apply Split Conformal Prediction (SCP) in language modeling to construct prediction sets with statistical guarantees. However, these methods typically rely on internal model logits or are restricted to multiple-choice settings, which hampers their generalizability and adaptability in dynamic, open-ended environments. In this paper, we introduce TRON, a two-step framework for risk control and assessment, applicable to any MLLM that supports sampling in both open-ended and closed-ended scenarios. TRON comprises two main components: (1) a novel conformal score to sample response sets of minimum size, and (2) a nonconformity score to identify high-quality responses based on self-consistency theory, controlling the error rates by two specific risk levels. Furthermore, we investigate semantic redundancy in prediction sets within open-ended contexts for the first time, leading to a promising evaluation metric for MLLMs based on average set size. Our comprehensive experiments across four Video Question-Answering (VideoQA) datasets utilizing eight MLLMs show that TRON achieves desired error rates bounded by two user-specified risk levels. Additionally, deduplicated prediction sets maintain adaptiveness while being more efficient and stable for risk assessment under different risk levels.

Abstract: Medical imaging is crucial for diagnosing a patient's health condition, and accurate segmentation of these images is essential for isolating regions of interest to ensure precise diagnosis and treatment planning. Existing methods primarily rely on bounding boxes or point-based prompts, while few have explored text-related prompts, despite clinicians often describing their observations and instructions in natural language. To address this gap, we first propose a RAG-based free-form text prompt generator, that leverages the domain corpus to generate diverse and realistic descriptions. Then, we introduce FLanS, a novel medical image segmentation model that handles various free-form text prompts, including professional anatomy-informed queries, anatomy-agnostic position-driven queries, and anatomy-agnostic size-driven queries. Additionally, our model also incorporates a symmetry-aware canonicalization module to ensure consistent, accurate segmentations across varying scan orientations and reduce confusion between the anatomical position of an organ and its appearance in the scan. FLanS is trained on a large-scale dataset of over 100k medical images from 7 public datasets. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the model's superior language understanding and segmentation precision, along with a deep comprehension of the relationship between them, outperforming SOTA baselines on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.

<title>Beware of Calibration Data for Pruning Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2410.17711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are widely applied across various fields, model compression has become increasingly crucial for reducing costs and improving inference efficiency. Post-training pruning is a promising method that does not require resource-intensive iterative training and only needs a small amount of calibration data to assess the importance of parameters. Recent research has enhanced post-training pruning from different aspects but few of them systematically explore the effects of calibration data, and it is unclear if there exist better calibration data construction strategies. We fill this blank and surprisingly observe that calibration data is also crucial to post-training pruning, especially for high sparsity. Through controlled experiments on important influence factors of calibration data, including the pruning settings, the amount of data, and its similarity with pre-training data, we observe that a small size of data is adequate, and more similar data to its pre-training stage can yield better performance. As pre-training data is usually inaccessible for advanced LLMs, we further provide a self-generating calibration data synthesis strategy to construct feasible calibration data. Experimental results on recent strong open-source LLMs (e.g., DCLM, and LLaMA-3) show that the proposed strategy can enhance the performance of strong pruning methods (e.g., Wanda, DSnoT, OWL) by a large margin (up to $2.68\%$). Code is available at https://github.com/Dereck0602/calibration_data.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction (DR) plays a crucial role in various fields, including data engineering and visualization, by simplifying complex datasets while retaining essential information. However, achieving both high DR accuracy and strong explainability remains a fundamental challenge, especially for users dealing with high-dimensional data. Traditional DR methods often face a trade-off between precision and transparency, where optimizing for performance can lead to reduced explainability, and vice versa. This limitation is especially prominent in real-world applications such as image, tabular, and text data analysis, where both accuracy and explainability are critical. To address these challenges, this work introduces the MOE-based Explainable Deep Manifold Transformation (DMT-ME). The proposed approach combines hyperbolic embeddings, which effectively capture complex hierarchical structures, with Mixture of Experts (MOE) models, which dynamically allocate tasks based on input features. DMT-ME enhances DR accuracy by leveraging hyperbolic embeddings to represent the hierarchical nature of data, while also improving explainability by explicitly linking input data, embedding outcomes, and key features through the MOE structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DMT-ME consistently achieves superior performance in both DR accuracy and model explainability, making it a robust solution for complex data analysis.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) prompted with text and audio have achieved state-of-the-art performance across various auditory tasks, including speech, music, and general audio, showing emergent abilities on unseen tasks. However, their potential has yet to be fully demonstrated in bioacoustics tasks, such as detecting animal vocalizations in large recordings, classifying rare and endangered species, and labeling context and behavior -- tasks that are crucial for conservation, biodiversity monitoring, and animal behavior studies. In this work, we present NatureLM-audio, the first audio-language foundation model specifically designed for bioacoustics. Our training dataset consists of carefully curated text-audio pairs spanning bioacoustics, speech, and music, designed to address the field's limited availability of annotated data. We demonstrate successful transfer of learned representations from music and speech to bioacoustics, and our model shows promising generalization to unseen taxa and tasks. We evaluate NatureLM-audio on a novel benchmark (BEANS-Zero) and it sets a new state of the art on several bioacoustics tasks, including zero-shot classification of unseen species. To advance bioacoustics research, we release our model weights, benchmark data, and open-source the code for training and benchmark data generation and model training.

Abstract: Several recent works seek to adapt general-purpose large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) for medical applications through continued pretraining on publicly available biomedical corpora. These works typically claim that such domain-adaptive pretraining improves performance on various downstream medical tasks, such as answering medical exam questions. In this paper, we compare ten "medical" LLMs and two VLMs against their corresponding base models, arriving at a different conclusion: all medical VLMs and nearly all medical LLMs fail to consistently improve over their base models in the zero-/few-shot prompting and supervised fine-tuning regimes for medical question answering (QA). For instance, on clinical-note-based QA tasks in the 3-shot setting, medical LLMs outperform their base models in only 26.7% of cases, reach a (statistical) tie in 16.7% of cases, and perform significantly worse in the remaining 56.7% of cases. Our conclusions are based on (i) comparing each medical model directly against its base model; (ii) optimizing the prompts for each model separately in zero-/few-shot prompting; and (iii) accounting for statistical uncertainty in comparisons. Our findings suggest that state-of-the-art general-domain models may already exhibit strong medical knowledge and reasoning capabilities, and offer recommendations to strengthen the conclusions of future studies.

<title>Multimodal Object Detection using Depth and Image Data for Manufacturing Parts</title>

Abstract: Manufacturing requires reliable object detection methods for precise picking and handling of diverse types of manufacturing parts and components. Traditional object detection methods utilize either only 2D images from cameras or 3D data from lidars or similar 3D sensors. However, each of these sensors have weaknesses and limitations. Cameras do not have depth perception and 3D sensors typically do not carry color information. These weaknesses can undermine the reliability and robustness of industrial manufacturing systems. To address these challenges, this work proposes a multi-sensor system combining an red-green-blue (RGB) camera and a 3D point cloud sensor. The two sensors are calibrated for precise alignment of the multimodal data captured from the two hardware devices. A novel multimodal object detection method is developed to process both RGB and depth data. This object detector is based on the Faster R-CNN baseline that was originally designed to process only camera images. The results show that the multimodal model significantly outperforms the depth-only and RGB-only baselines on established object detection metrics. More specifically, the multimodal model improves mAP by 13% and raises Mean Precision by 11.8% in comparison to the RGB-only baseline. Compared to the depth-only baseline, it improves mAP by 78% and raises Mean Precision by 57%. Hence, this method facilitates more reliable and robust object detection in service to smart manufacturing applications.

<title>Enhancing Diffusion Posterior Sampling for Inverse Problems by Integrating Crafted Measurements</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful foundation model for visual generations. With an appropriate sampling process, it can effectively serve as a generative prior for solving general inverse problems. Current posterior sampling-based methods take the measurement (i.e., degraded image sample) into the posterior sampling to infer the distribution of the target data (i.e., clean image sample). However, in this manner, we show that high-frequency information can be prematurely introduced during the early stages, which could induce larger posterior estimate errors during restoration sampling. To address this observation, we first reveal that forming the log-posterior gradient with the noisy measurement ( i.e., noisy measurement from a diffusion forward process) instead of the clean one can benefit the early posterior sampling. Consequently, we propose a novel diffusion posterior sampling method DPS-CM, which incorporates a Crafted Measurement (i.e., noisy measurement crafted by a reverse denoising process, rather than constructed from the diffusion forward process) to form the posterior estimate. This integration aims to mitigate the misalignment with the diffusion prior caused by cumulative posterior estimate errors. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the overall capacity to solve general and noisy inverse problems, such as Gaussian deblurring, super-resolution, inpainting, nonlinear deblurring, and tasks with Poisson noise, relative to existing approaches.

<title>GenBFA: An Evolutionary Optimization Approach to Bit-Flip Attacks on LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), excelling in tasks like text generation and summarization. However, their increasing adoption in mission-critical applications raises concerns about hardware-based threats, particularly bit-flip attacks (BFAs). BFAs, enabled by fault injection methods such as Rowhammer, target model parameters in memory, compromising both integrity and performance. Identifying critical parameters for BFAs in the vast parameter space of LLMs poses significant challenges. While prior research suggests transformer-based architectures are inherently more robust to BFAs compared to traditional deep neural networks, we challenge this assumption. For the first time, we demonstrate that as few as three bit-flips can cause catastrophic performance degradation in an LLM with billions of parameters. Current BFA techniques are inadequate for exploiting this vulnerability due to the difficulty of efficiently identifying critical parameters within the immense parameter space. To address this, we propose AttentionBreaker, a novel framework tailored for LLMs that enables efficient traversal of the parameter space to identify critical parameters. Additionally, we introduce GenBFA, an evolutionary optimization strategy designed to refine the search further, isolating the most critical bits for an efficient and effective attack. Empirical results reveal the profound vulnerability of LLMs to AttentionBreaker. For example, merely three bit-flips (4.129 x 10^-9% of total parameters) in the LLaMA3-8B-Instruct 8-bit quantized (W8) model result in a complete performance collapse: accuracy on MMLU tasks drops from 67.3% to 0%, and Wikitext perplexity skyrockets from 12.6 to 4.72 x 10^5. These findings underscore the effectiveness of AttentionBreaker in uncovering and exploiting critical vulnerabilities within LLM architectures.

Abstract: Pretrained foundation models and transformer architectures have driven the success of large language models (LLMs) and other modern AI breakthroughs. However, similar advancements in health data modeling remain limited due to the need for innovative adaptations. Wearable movement data offers a valuable avenue for exploration, as it's a core feature in nearly all commercial smartwatches, well established in clinical and mental health research, and the sequential nature of the data shares similarities to language. We introduce the Pretrained Actigraphy Transformer (PAT), the first open source foundation model designed for time-series wearable movement data. Leveraging transformer-based architectures and novel techniques, such as patch embeddings, and pretraining on data from 29,307 participants in a national U.S. sample, PAT achieves state-of-the-art performance in several mental health prediction tasks. PAT is also lightweight and easily interpretable, making it a robust tool for mental health research.

Abstract: In the area of recommender systems, the vast majority of research efforts is spent on developing increasingly sophisticated recommendation models, also using increasingly more computational resources. Unfortunately, most of these research efforts target a very small set of application domains, mostly e-commerce and media recommendation. Furthermore, many of these models are never evaluated with users, let alone put into practice. The scientific, economic and societal value of much of these efforts by scholars therefore remains largely unclear. To achieve a stronger positive impact resulting from these efforts, we posit that we as a research community should more often address use cases where recommender systems contribute to societal good (RS4Good). In this opinion piece, we first discuss a number of examples where the use of recommender systems for problems of societal concern has been successfully explored in the literature. We then proceed by outlining a paradigmatic shift that is needed to conduct successful RS4Good research, where the key ingredients are interdisciplinary collaborations and longitudinal evaluation approaches with humans in the loop.

<title>SEUF: Is Unlearning One Expert Enough for Mixture-of-Experts LLMs?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18797</link>

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLMs unlearning have shown remarkable success in removing unwanted data-model influences while preserving the model's utility for legitimate knowledge. Despite these strides, sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs--a key subset of the LLM family--have remained unexplored in the context of unlearning. As MoE LLMs are celebrated for their exceptional performance, we ask:How can unlearning be performed effectively and efficiently on MoE LLMs? Our pilot study shows that the dynamic routing nature of MoE LLMs introduces unique challenges, leading to excessive forgetting, uncontrolled knowledge erasure and substantial utility drops when existing unlearning methods are applied. To address this, we propose a novel Selected-Expert Unlearning Framework (SEUF). Through expert attribution, unlearning is concentrated on the most actively engaged experts for the specified knowledge. Concurrently, an anchor loss is applied to the router to stabilize the active state of this targeted expert, ensuring focused and controlled unlearning. SEUF is compatible with various standard unlearning algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEUF enhances both forget quality up to 5% and model utility by 35% on MoE LLMs across various benchmarks and LLM architectures (compared to standard unlearning algorithms), while only unlearning 0.06% of the model parameters.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of diffusion-based generative models, portrait image animation has achieved remarkable results. However, it still faces challenges in temporally consistent video generation and fast sampling due to its iterative sampling nature. This paper presents FLOAT, an audio-driven talking portrait video generation method based on flow matching generative model. Instead of a pixel-based latent space, we take advantage of a learned orthogonal motion latent space, enabling efficient generation and editing of temporally consistent motion. To achieve this, we introduce a transformer-based vector field predictor with an effective frame-wise conditioning mechanism. Additionally, our method supports speech-driven emotion enhancement, enabling a natural incorporation of expressive motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art audio-driven talking portrait methods in terms of visual quality, motion fidelity, and efficiency.

<title>ZipAR: Parallel Auto-regressive Image Generation through Spatial Locality</title>

arXiv:2412.04062v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose ZipAR, a training-free, plug-and-play parallel decoding framework for accelerating auto-regressive (AR) visual generation. The motivation stems from the observation that images exhibit local structures, and spatially distant regions tend to have minimal interdependence. Given a partially decoded set of visual tokens, in addition to the original next-token prediction scheme in the row dimension, the tokens corresponding to spatially adjacent regions in the column dimension can be decoded in parallel, enabling the ``next-set prediction'' paradigm. By decoding multiple tokens simultaneously in a single forward pass, the number of forward passes required to generate an image is significantly reduced, resulting in a substantial improvement in generation efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that ZipAR can reduce the number of model forward passes by up to 91% on the Emu3-Gen model without requiring any additional retraining. Code is available here: https://github.com/ThisisBillhe/ZipAR.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2412.10493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are widespread, but their limited safety guardrails expose end users to harmful content and potentially allow for model misuse. Current safety measures are typically limited to text-based filtering or concept removal strategies, able to remove just a few concepts from the model's generative capabilities. In this work, we introduce AlignGuard, a method for safety alignment of T2I models. We enable the application of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for safety purposes in T2I models by synthetically generating a dataset of harmful and safe image-text pairs, which we call CoProV2. Using a custom DPO strategy and this dataset, we train safety experts, in the form of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) matrices, able to guide the generation process away from specific safety-related concepts. Then, we merge the experts into a single LoRA using a novel merging strategy for optimal scaling performance. This expert-based approach enables scalability, allowing us to remove 7x more harmful concepts from T2I models compared to baselines. AlignGuard consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art on many benchmarks and establishes new practices for safety alignment in T2I networks. Code and data will be shared at https://safetydpo.github.io/.

<title>PRMBench: A Fine-grained and Challenging Benchmark for Process-Level Reward Models</title>

Abstract: Process-level Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial for complex reasoning and decision-making tasks, where each intermediate step plays an important role in the reasoning process. Since language models are prone to various types of errors during the reasoning process, PRMs are required to possess nuanced capabilities for detecting various implicit error types in real-world scenarios. However, current benchmarks primarily focus on step correctness, failing to evaluate PRMs' performance systematically. To address this gap, we introduce PRMBench, a process-level benchmark specifically designed to assess the fine-grained error detection capabilities of PRMs. PRMBench comprises 6,216 carefully designed problems and 83,456 step-level labels, evaluating models across multiple dimensions, including simplicity, soundness, and sensitivity. In our experiments on 15 models, spanning both open-source PRMs and closed-source large language models prompted as critic models, we uncover significant weaknesses in current PRMs. These findings underscore the challenges inherent in process-level evaluation and highlight key directions for future research. We hope PRMBench can be a robust bench for advancing research on PRM evaluation and development.

<title>Efficiently Serving Large Multimodal Models Using EPD Disaggregation</title>

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) extend Large Language Models (LLMs) by handling diverse inputs such as images, audio, and video, but at the cost of adding a multimodal encoding stage that increases both computational and memory overhead. This step negatively affects key Service Level Objectives (SLOs), such as time to first token (TTFT) and time per output token (TPOT). We introduce Encode-Prefill-Decode (EPD) Disaggregation, a novel framework that separates the encoding, prefill, and decode stages onto dedicated resources. Unlike current systems, which bundle encoding and prefill together, our approach decouples these steps, unlocking new opportunities and optimizations. These include a mechanism to cache multimedia tokens for efficient transfer, a novel way to parallelize the encoding load within a request, a module for optimal resource allocation for disaggregated serving, and a novel role-switching method to handle changing workload characteristics. Experimental evaluations with popular LMMs show substantial gains in memory efficiency (up to 15x lower peak memory utilization), batch sizes (up to 22x larger), 10x more images per request, and 2.2x larger KV caches. Furthermore, it leads to significant improvements in SLO attainment (up to 90-100% improvement) and TTFT (up to 71% reduction), compared to systems that do not disaggregate. The code is available at https://github.com/vbdi/epdserve.

Abstract: This research provides an in-depth evaluation of various machine learning models for energy forecasting, focusing on the unique challenges of seasonal variations in student residential settings. The study assesses the performance of baseline models, such as LSTM and GRU, alongside state-of-the-art forecasting methods, including Autoregressive Feedforward Neural Networks, Transformers, and hybrid approaches. Special attention is given to predicting energy consumption amidst challenges like seasonal patterns, vacations, meteorological changes, and irregular human activities that cause sudden fluctuations in usage. The findings reveal that no single model consistently outperforms others across all seasons, emphasizing the need for season-specific model selection or tailored designs. Notably, the proposed Hyper Network based LSTM and MiniAutoEncXGBoost models exhibit strong adaptability to seasonal variations, effectively capturing abrupt changes in energy consumption during summer months. This study advances the energy forecasting field by emphasizing the critical role of seasonal dynamics and model-specific behavior in achieving accurate predictions.

Abstract: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have demonstrated their superiority and versatility in modern Natural Language Processing (NLP), effectively adapting to various downstream tasks through further fine-tuning. Federated Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (FedPEFT) has emerged as a promising solution to address privacy and efficiency challenges in distributed training for PLMs on resource-constrained local devices. However, our measurements reveal two key limitations of FedPEFT: heterogeneous data across devices exacerbates performance degradation of low-rank adaptation, and a fixed parameter configuration results in communication inefficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose FedARA, a novel Adaptive Rank Allocation framework for federated parameter-efficient fine-tuning of language models. Specifically, FedARA employs truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) adaptation to enhance similar feature representation across clients, significantly mitigating the adverse effects of data heterogeneity. Subsequently, it utilizes dynamic rank allocation to progressively identify critical ranks, effectively improving communication efficiency. Lastly, it leverages rank-based module pruning to automatically remove inactive modules, steadily reducing local computational cost and memory usage in each federated learning round. Extensive experiments show that FedARA consistently outperforms baselines by an average of 6.95% to 8.49% across various datasets and models under heterogeneous data while significantly improving communication efficiency by 2.40$ \times$. Moreover, experiments on various edge devices demonstrate substantial decreases in total training time and energy consumption by up to 48.90% and 46.95%, respectively.

arXiv:2501.14694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is an emerging paradigm that exploits supervisory signals generated from the data itself, and many recent studies have leveraged SSL to conduct graph anomaly detection. However, we empirically found that three important factors can substantially impact detection performance across datasets: 1) the specific SSL strategy employed; 2) the tuning of the strategy's hyperparameters; and 3) the allocation of combination weights when using multiple strategies. Most SSL-based graph anomaly detection methods circumvent these issues by arbitrarily or selectively (i.e., guided by label information) choosing SSL strategies, hyperparameter settings, and combination weights. While an arbitrary choice may lead to subpar performance, using label information in an unsupervised setting is label information leakage and leads to severe overestimation of a method's performance. Leakage has been criticized as "one of the top ten data mining mistakes", yet many recent studies on SSL-based graph anomaly detection have been using label information to select hyperparameters. To mitigate this issue, we propose to use an internal evaluation strategy (with theoretical analysis) to select hyperparameters in SSL for unsupervised anomaly detection. We perform extensive experiments using 10 recent SSL-based graph anomaly detection algorithms on various benchmark datasets, demonstrating both the prior issues with hyperparameter selection and the effectiveness of our proposed strategy.

arXiv:2501.17905v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress across various domains, but their increasing scale results in high computational and memory costs. Recent studies have revealed that LLMs exhibit sparsity, providing the potential to reduce model size through pruning techniques. However, existing pruning methods typically follow a prune-then-finetune paradigm. Since the pruned components still contain valuable information, their direct removal often leads to irreversible performance degradation, imposing a substantial computational burden to recover performance during finetuning. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm that first applies regularization, then prunes, and finally finetunes. Based on this paradigm, we introduce DReSS, a simple and effective Data-driven Regularized Structured Streamlining method for LLMs. By leveraging a small amount of data to regularize the components to be pruned, DReSS explicitly transfers the important information to the remaining parts of the model in advance. Compared to direct pruning, this can reduce the information loss caused by parameter removal, thereby enhancing its language modeling capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that DReSS significantly outperforms existing pruning methods even under extreme pruning ratios, significantly reducing latency and increasing throughput.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate grounded responses by leveraging external knowledge databases without altering model parameters. Although the absence of weight tuning prevents leakage via model parameters, it introduces the risk of inference adversaries exploiting retrieved documents in the model's context. Existing methods for membership inference and data extraction often rely on jailbreaking or carefully crafted unnatural queries, which can be easily detected or thwarted with query rewriting techniques common in RAG systems. In this work, we present Interrogation Attack (IA), a membership inference technique targeting documents in the RAG datastore. By crafting natural-text queries that are answerable only with the target document's presence, our approach demonstrates successful inference with just 30 queries while remaining stealthy; straightforward detectors identify adversarial prompts from existing methods up to ~76x more frequently than those generated by our attack. We observe a 2x improvement in TPR@1%FPR over prior inference attacks across diverse RAG configurations, all while costing less than $0.02 per document inference.

Abstract: LiDAR-camera extrinsic calibration (LCEC) is crucial for multi-modal data fusion in mechatronics. Existing methods, whether target-based or target-free, typically rely on customized calibration targets or fixed scene types, limiting their practicality in real-world applications. To address these challenges, we introduce EdO-LCEC, the first environment-driven online calibration approach. Unlike traditional target-free methods, EdO-LCEC observes the feature density of the application environment through a generalizable scene discriminator. Based on this feature density, EdO-LCEC extracts LiDAR intensity and depth features from varying perspectives to achieve higher calibration accuracy. To overcome the challenges of cross-modal feature matching between LiDAR and camera, we propose dual-path correspondence matching (DPCM), which leverages both structural and textural consistency for reliable 3D-2D correspondences. Additionally, our approach models the calibration process as a joint optimization problem utilizing global constraints from multiple views and scenes to enhance accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that EdO-LCEC outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in sparse or partially overlapping sensor views.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models hold significant potential in robotics, enabling the generation of diverse and smooth trajectories directly from raw representations of the environment. Despite this promise, applying diffusion models to motion planning remains challenging due to their difficulty in enforcing critical constraints, such as collision avoidance and kinematic feasibility. These limitations become even more pronounced in Multi-Robot Motion Planning (MRMP), where multiple robots must coordinate in shared spaces. To address these challenges, this work proposes Simultaneous MRMP Diffusion (SMD), a novel approach integrating constrained optimization into the diffusion sampling process to produce collision-free, kinematically feasible trajectories. Additionally, the paper introduces a comprehensive MRMP benchmark to evaluate trajectory planning algorithms across scenarios with varying robot densities, obstacle complexities, and motion constraints. Experimental results show SMD consistently outperforms classical and other learning-based motion planners, achieving higher success rates and efficiency in complex multi-robot environments.

<title>Time to Rethink AI for Combinatorial Optimization: Classical Algorithms Remain Tough to Match</title>

Abstract: This position paper argues that the machine learning community should fundamentally rethink how AI-inspired methods are developed and evaluated for combinatorial optimization (CO). We present comprehensive empirical benchmarks comparing various recent AI-inspired GPU-based methods with several classical CPU-based solvers on the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem. Strikingly, even on in-distribution random graphs, leading AI-inspired methods are consistently outperformed by the state-of-the-art classical solver KaMIS, and some AI-inspired methods frequently fail to surpass even the simplest degree-based greedy heuristic. To better understand the source of these failures, we introduce a novel analysis, serialization, which reveals that non-backtracking AI methods, such as LTFT (based on GFlowNets), end up reasoning similarly to the simplest degree-based greedy heuristic, and thus worse than KaMIS.
  Our findings reveal three core issues: (1) Limited benchmarks and evaluation - AI-inspired methods are often tested only on small instances with very limited inference time, which covers up issues with scalability and resource usage; (2) Intrinsic hardness and learning limits - even under ideal, in-distribution conditions, learning-based approaches lag behind classical heuristics, highlighting inherent barriers that receive little attention; and (3) Insufficient use and understanding of classical heuristics - current learning frameworks often neglect to incorporate effective classical techniques.
  Although we use MIS as a testbed, similar gaps and challenges have been reported in other combinatorial optimization problems, suggesting broader relevance for our recommendations. We propose that future research must address these issues by rigorous benchmarking, deepening understanding of learning limitations, and integrating classical heuristics into AI-inspired methods.

Abstract: Foundation models trained on patient electronic health records (EHRs) require tokenizing medical data into sequences of discrete vocabulary items. Existing tokenizers treat medical codes from EHRs as isolated textual tokens. However, each medical code is defined by its textual description, its position in ontological hierarchies, and its relationships to other codes, such as disease co-occurrences and drug-treatment associations. Medical vocabularies contain more than 600,000 codes with critical information for clinical reasoning. We introduce MedTok, a multimodal medical code tokenizer that uses the text descriptions and relational context of codes. MedTok processes text using a language model encoder and encodes the relational structure with a graph encoder. It then quantizes both modalities into a unified token space, preserving modality-specific and cross-modality information. We integrate MedTok into five EHR models and evaluate it on operational and clinical tasks across in-patient and out-patient datasets, including outcome prediction, diagnosis classification, drug recommendation, and risk stratification. Swapping standard EHR tokenizers with MedTok improves AUPRC across all EHR models, by 4.10% on MIMIC-III, 4.78% on MIMIC-IV, and 11.32% on EHRShot, with the largest gains in drug recommendation. Beyond EHR modeling, we demonstrate using MedTok tokenizer with medical QA systems. Our results demonstrate the potential of MedTok as a unified tokenizer for medical codes, improving tokenization for medical foundation models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promising capabilities in predicting human emotions from text. However, the mechanisms through which these models process emotional stimuli remain largely unexplored. Our study addresses this gap by investigating how autoregressive LLMs infer emotions, showing that emotion representations are functionally localized to specific regions in the model. Our evaluation includes diverse model families and sizes and is supported by robustness checks. We then show that the identified representations are psychologically plausible by drawing on cognitive appraisal theory, a well-established psychological framework positing that emotions emerge from evaluations (appraisals) of environmental stimuli. By causally intervening on construed appraisal concepts, we steer the generation and show that the outputs align with theoretical and intuitive expectations. This work highlights a novel way to causally intervene and precisely shape emotional text generation, potentially benefiting safety and alignment in sensitive affective domains.

Abstract: The increasing demand for mental health services has led to the rise of AI-driven mental health chatbots, though challenges related to privacy, data collection, and expertise persist. Motivational Interviewing (MI) is gaining attention as a theoretical basis for boosting expertise in the development of these chatbots. However, existing datasets are showing limitations for training chatbots, leading to a substantial demand for publicly available resources in the field of MI and psychotherapy. These challenges are even more pronounced in non-English languages, where they receive less attention. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that simulates MI sessions enriched with the expertise of professional therapists. We train an MI forecaster model that mimics the behavioral choices of professional therapists and employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate utterances through prompt engineering. Then, we present KMI, the first synthetic dataset theoretically grounded in MI, containing 1,000 high-quality Korean Motivational Interviewing dialogues. Through an extensive expert evaluation of the generated dataset and the dialogue model trained on it, we demonstrate the quality, expertise, and practicality of KMI. We also introduce novel metrics derived from MI theory in order to evaluate dialogues from the perspective of MI.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Semantic Communication (SemCom) framework for real-time adaptive-bitrate video streaming by integrating Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) within the FFmpeg techniques. This solution addresses the challenges of high bandwidth usage, storage inefficiencies, and quality of experience (QoE) degradation associated with traditional Constant Bitrate Streaming (CBS) and Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABS). The proposed approach leverages LDMs to compress I-frames into a latent space, offering significant storage and semantic transmission savings without sacrificing high visual quality. While retaining B-frames and P-frames as adjustment metadata to support efficient refinement of video reconstruction at the user side, the proposed framework further incorporates state-of-the-art denoising and Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) techniques. These techniques mitigate semantic ambiguity and restore temporal coherence between frames, even in noisy wireless communication environments. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method achieves high-quality video streaming with optimized bandwidth usage, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in terms of QoE and resource efficiency. This work opens new possibilities for scalable real-time video streaming in 5G and future post-5G networks.

Abstract: Masked Image Modeling (MIM) offers a promising approach to self-supervised representation learning, however existing MIM models still lag behind the state-of-the-art. In this paper, we systematically analyze target representations, loss functions, and architectures, to introduce CAPI - a novel pure-MIM framework that relies on the prediction of latent clusterings. Our approach leverages a clustering-based loss, which is stable to train, and exhibits promising scaling properties. Our ViT-L backbone, CAPI, achieves 83.8% accuracy on ImageNet and 32.1% mIoU on ADE20K with simple linear probes, substantially outperforming previous MIM methods and approaching the performance of the current state-of-the-art, DINOv2. We release all our code and models.

Abstract: Accurate identification of bioactive peptides (BPs) and protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) is essential for understanding protein function and advancing therapeutic discovery. However, most computational methods remain limited in their generalizability across diverse peptide functions. Here, we present PDeepPP, a unified deep learning framework that integrates pretrained protein language models with a hybrid transformer-convolutional architecture, enabling robust identification across diverse peptide classes and PTM sites. We curated comprehensive benchmark datasets and implemented strategies to address data imbalance, allowing PDeepPP to systematically extract both global and local sequence features. Through extensive analyses-including dimensionality reduction and comparison studies-PDeepPP demonstrates strong, interpretable peptide representations and achieves state-of-the-art performance in 25 of the 33 biological identification tasks. Notably, PDeepPP attains high accuracy in antimicrobial (0.9726) and phosphorylation site (0.9984) identification, with 99.5% specificity in glycosylation site prediction and substantial reduction in false negatives in antimalarial tasks. By enabling large-scale, accurate peptide analysis, PDeepPP supports biomedical research and the discovery of novel therapeutic targets for disease treatment. All code, datasets, and pretrained models are publicly available via GitHub:https://github.com/fondress/PDeepPP and Hugging Face:https://huggingface.co/fondress/PDeppPP.

arXiv:2502.15727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to evaluate the efficiency of a RAG-based agentic Large Language Model (LLM) architecture for network packet seed generation and enrichment. Enhanced by chain-of-thought (COT) prompting techniques, the proposed approach focuses on the improvement of the seeds' structural quality in order to guide protocol fuzzing frameworks through a wide exploration of the protocol state space. Our method leverages RAG and text embeddings to dynamically reference to the Request For Comments (RFC) documents knowledge base for answering queries regarding the protocol's Finite State Machine (FSM), then iteratively reasons through the retrieved knowledge, for output refinement and proper seed placement. We then evaluate the response structure quality of the agent's output, based on metrics as BLEU, ROUGE, and Word Error Rate (WER) by comparing the generated packets against the ground-truth packets. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements of up to 18.19%, 14.81%, and 23.45% in BLEU, ROUGE, and WER, respectively, over baseline models. These results confirm the potential of such approach, improving LLM-based protocol fuzzing frameworks for the identification of hidden vulnerabilities.

<title>Investigating the Impact of Quantization Methods on the Safety and Reliability of Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools for modern applications, but their computational demands limit accessibility. Quantization offers efficiency gains, yet its impact on safety and trustworthiness remains poorly understood. To address this, we introduce OpenMiniSafety, a human-curated safety dataset with 1.067 challenging questions to rigorously evaluate model behavior. We publicly release human safety evaluations for four LLMs (both quantized and full-precision), totaling 4.268 annotated question-answer pairs. By assessing 66 quantized variants of these models using four post-training quantization (PTQ) and two quantization-aware training (QAT) methods across four safety benchmarks including human-centric evaluations we uncover critical safety performance trade-offs. Our results show both PTQ and QAT can degrade safety alignment, with QAT techniques like QLORA or STE performing less safely. No single method consistently outperforms others across benchmarks, precision settings, or models, highlighting the need for safety-aware compression strategies. Furthermore, precision-specialized methods (e.g., QUIK and AWQ for 4-bit, AQLM and Q-PET for 2-bit) excel at their target precision, meaning that these methods are not better at compressing but rather different approaches.

Abstract: Leading language model (LM) providers like OpenAI and Anthropic allow customers to fine-tune frontier LMs for specific use cases. To prevent abuse, these providers apply filters to block fine-tuning on overtly harmful data. In this setting, we make three contributions: First, while past work has shown that safety alignment is "shallow", we correspondingly demonstrate that existing fine-tuning attacks are shallow -- attacks target only the first several tokens of the model response, and consequently can be blocked by generating the first several response tokens with an aligned model. Second, we conceptually illustrate how to make attacks deeper by introducing a new fine-tuning attack that trains models to first refuse harmful requests before answering them; this "refuse-then-comply" strategy bypasses shallow defenses and produces harmful responses that evade output filters. Third, we demonstrate the potency of our new fine-tuning attack by jailbreaking both open-source models equipped with defenses and production models, achieving attack success rates of 57% and 72% against GPT-4o and Claude Haiku, respectively. Our attack received a $2000 bug bounty from OpenAI and was acknowledged as a vulnerability by Anthropic. Our work undermines the notion that models are safe because they initially refuse harmful requests and broadens awareness of the scope of attacks that face production fine-tuning APIs.

Abstract: Existing contextual multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms fail to effectively capture both long-term trends and local patterns across all arms, leading to suboptimal performance in environments with rapidly changing reward structures. They also rely on static exploration rates, which do not dynamically adjust to changing conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose LNUCB-TA, a hybrid bandit model integrating a novel nonlinear component (adaptive k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)) for reducing time complexity, alongside a global-and-local attention-based exploration mechanism. Our approach uniquely combines linear and nonlinear estimation techniques, with the nonlinear module dynamically adjusting k based on reward variance to enhance spatiotemporal pattern recognition. This reduces the likelihood of selecting suboptimal arms while improving reward estimation accuracy and computational efficiency. The attention-based mechanism ranks arms by past performance and selection frequency, dynamically adjusting exploration and exploitation in real time without requiring manual tuning of exploration rates. By integrating global attention (assessing all arms collectively) and local attention (focusing on individual arms), LNUCB-TA efficiently adapts to temporal and spatial complexities. Empirical results show LNUCB-TA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art linear, nonlinear, and hybrid bandits in cumulative and mean reward, convergence, and robustness across different exploration rates. Theoretical analysis further confirms its reliability with a sub-linear regret bound.

Abstract: In the dynamic landscape of artificial intelligence, the exploration of hallucinations within vision-language (VL) models emerges as a critical frontier. This work delves into the intricacies of hallucinatory phenomena exhibited by widely used image captioners, unraveling interesting patterns. Specifically, we step upon previously introduced techniques of conceptual counterfactual explanations to address VL hallucinations. The deterministic and efficient nature of the employed conceptual counterfactuals backbone is able to suggest semantically minimal edits driven by hierarchical knowledge, so that the transition from a hallucinated caption to a non-hallucinated one is performed in a black-box manner. HalCECE, our proposed hallucination detection framework is highly interpretable, by providing semantically meaningful edits apart from standalone numbers, while the hierarchical decomposition of hallucinated concepts leads to a thorough hallucination analysis. Another novelty tied to the current work is the investigation of role hallucinations, being one of the first works to involve interconnections between visual concepts in hallucination detection. Overall, HalCECE recommends an explainable direction to the crucial field of VL hallucination detection, thus fostering trustworthy evaluation of current and future VL systems.

Abstract: We address the Multi-Robot Motion Planning (MRMP) problem of computing collision-free trajectories for multiple robots in shared continuous environments. While existing frameworks effectively decompose MRMP into single-robot subproblems, spatiotemporal motion planning with dynamic obstacles remains challenging, particularly in cluttered or narrow-corridor settings. We propose Space-Time Graphs of Convex Sets (ST-GCS), a novel planner that systematically covers the collision-free space-time domain with convex sets instead of relying on random sampling. By extending Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS) into the time dimension, ST-GCS formulates time-optimal trajectories in a unified convex optimization that naturally accommodates velocity bounds and flexible arrival times. We also propose Exact Convex Decomposition (ECD) to "reserve" trajectories as spatiotemporal obstacles, maintaining a collision-free space-time graph of convex sets for subsequent planning. Integrated into two prioritized-planning frameworks, ST-GCS consistently achieves higher success rates and better solution quality than state-of-the-art sampling-based planners -- often at orders-of-magnitude faster runtimes -- underscoring its benefits for MRMP in challenging settings.

Abstract: Pipeline parallelism (PP) is widely used for training large language models (LLMs), yet its scalability is often constrained by high activation memory consumption as the number of in-flight microbatches grows with the degree of PP. In this paper, we focus on addressing this challenge by leveraging the under-explored memory offload strategy in PP. With empirical study, we discover that in the majority of standard configurations, at least half, and potentially all, of the activations can be offloaded with negligible overhead. In the cases where full overload is not possible, we introduce a novel selective offload strategy that decreases peak activation memory in a better-than-linear manner. Furthermore, we integrate memory offload with other techniques to jointly consider overall throughput and memory limitation. Our experiments proves that the per-device activation memory effectively reduces with the total number of stages, making PP a stronger alternative than TP, offering up to a 19\% acceleration with even lower memory consumption. The implementation is open-sourced at \href{https://github.com/sail-sg/zero-bubble-pipeline-parallelism}{this url}.

Abstract: Time series data are foundational in finance, healthcare, and energy domains. However, most existing methods and datasets remain focused on a narrow spectrum of tasks, such as forecasting or anomaly detection. To bridge this gap, we introduce Time Series Multi-Task Question Answering (Time-MQA), a unified framework that enables natural language queries across multiple time series tasks - numerical analytical tasks and open-ended question answering with reasoning. Central to Time-MQA is the TSQA dataset, a large-scale dataset containing $\sim$200k question-answer pairs derived from diverse time series spanning environment, traffic, etc. This comprehensive resource covers various time series lengths and promotes robust model development. We further demonstrate how continually pre-training large language models (Mistral 7B, Llama-3 8B, and Qwen-2.5 7B) on the TSQA dataset enhanced time series reasoning capabilities, moving beyond mere numeric tasks and enabling more advanced and intuitive interactions with temporal data. The complete TSQA dataset, models, user study questionnaires for evaluation, and other related materials have been open-sourced.

Abstract: Motion synthesis for diverse object categories holds great potential for 3D content creation but remains underexplored due to two key challenges: (1) the lack of comprehensive motion datasets that include a wide range of high-quality motions and annotations, and (2) the absence of methods capable of handling heterogeneous skeletal templates from diverse objects. To address these challenges, we contribute the following: First, we augment the Truebones Zoo dataset, a high-quality animal motion dataset covering over 70 species, by annotating it with detailed text descriptions, making it suitable for text-based motion synthesis. Second, we introduce rig augmentation techniques that generate diverse motion data while preserving consistent dynamics, enabling models to adapt to various skeletal configurations. Finally, we redesign existing motion diffusion models to dynamically adapt to arbitrary skeletal templates, enabling motion synthesis for a diverse range of objects with varying structures. Experiments show that our method learns to generate high-fidelity motions from textual descriptions for diverse and even unseen objects, setting a strong foundation for motion synthesis across diverse object categories and skeletal templates. Qualitative results are available at: $\href{https://t2m4lvo.github.io}{https://t2m4lvo.github.io}$.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit the ability to generalize given few-shot examples in their input prompt, an emergent capability known as in-context learning (ICL). We investigate whether LLMs use ICL to perform structured reasoning in ways that are consistent with a Bayesian framework or rely on pattern matching. Using a controlled setting of biased coin flips, we find that: (1) LLMs often possess biased priors, causing initial divergence in zero-shot settings, (2) in-context evidence outweighs explicit bias instructions, (3) LLMs broadly follow Bayesian posterior updates, with deviations primarily due to miscalibrated priors rather than flawed updates, and (4) attention magnitude has negligible effect on Bayesian inference. With sufficient demonstrations of biased coin flips via ICL, LLMs update their priors in a Bayesian manner.

Abstract: Food systems are responsible for a third of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. We investigate what Large Language Models (LLMs) can contribute to reducing the environmental impacts of food production. We define a typology of design and prediction tasks based on the sustainable food literature and collaboration with domain experts, and evaluate six LLMs on four tasks in our typology. For example, for a sustainable protein design task, food science experts estimated that collaboration with an LLM can reduce time spent by 45% on average, compared to 22% for collaboration with another expert human food scientist. However, for a sustainable menu design task, LLMs produce suboptimal solutions when instructed to consider both human satisfaction and climate impacts. We propose a general framework for integrating LLMs with combinatorial optimization to improve reasoning capabilities. Our approach decreases emissions of food choices by 79% in a hypothetical restaurant while maintaining participants' satisfaction with their set of choices. Our results demonstrate LLMs' potential, supported by optimization techniques, to accelerate sustainable food development and adoption.

Abstract: Model merging is a technique that combines multiple finetuned models into a single model without additional training, allowing a free-rider to cheaply inherit specialized capabilities. This study investigates methodologies to suppress unwanted model merging by free-riders. Existing methods such as model watermarking or fingerprinting can only detect merging in hindsight. In contrast, we propose a first proactive defense against model merging. Specifically, our defense method modifies the model parameters so that the model is disrupted if the model is merged with any other model, while its functionality is kept unchanged if not merged with others. Our approach consists of two modules, rearranging MLP parameters and scaling attention heads, which push the model out of the shared basin in parameter space, causing the merging performance with other models to degrade significantly. We conduct extensive experiments on image classification, image generation, and text classification to demonstrate that our defense severely disrupts merging while retaining the functionality of the post-protect model. Moreover, we analyze potential adaptive attacks and further propose a dropout-based pruning to improve our proposal's robustness.

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SPD) aims to accelerate the auto-regressive token generation process of a target Large Language Model (LLM). Some approaches employ a draft model with multiple heads to predict a sequence of future tokens, where each head handles a token in the sequence. The target LLM verifies the predicted sequence and accepts aligned tokens, enabling efficient multi-token generation. However, existing methods assume that all tokens within a sequence are equally important, employing identical head structures and relying on a single-generation paradigm, either serial or parallel. To this end, we theoretically demonstrate that initial tokens in the draft sequence are more important than later ones. Building on this insight, we propose Gumiho, a hybrid model combining serial and parallel heads. Specifically, given the critical importance of early tokens, we employ a sophisticated Transformer architecture for the early draft heads in a serial configuration to improve accuracy. For later tokens, we utilize multiple lightweight MLP heads operating in parallel to enhance efficiency. By allocating more advanced model structures and longer running times to the early heads, Gumiho achieves improved overall performance. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, fully validating its effectiveness.

<title>The Problem of the Priors, or Posteriors?</title>

Abstract: The problem of the priors is well known: it concerns the challenge of identifying norms that govern one's prior credences. I argue that a key to addressing this problem lies in considering what I call the problem of the posteriors -- the challenge of identifying norms that directly govern one's posterior credences, which backward induce some norms on the priors via the diachronic requirement of conditionalization. This forward-looking approach can be summarized as: Think ahead, work backward. Although this idea can be traced to Freedman (1963), Carnap (1963), and Shimony (1970), I believe that it has not received enough attention. In this paper, I initiate a systematic defense of forward-looking Bayesianism, addressing potential objections from more traditional views (both subjectivist and objectivist). I also develop a specific approach to forward-looking Bayesianism -- one that values the convergence of posterior credences to the truth, and treats it as a fundamental rather than derived norm. This approach, called convergentist Bayesianism, is argued to be crucial for a Bayesian foundation of Ockham's razor in statistics and machine learning.

<title>Neurons: Emulating the Human Visual Cortex Improves Fidelity and Interpretability in fMRI-to-Video Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: Decoding visual stimuli from neural activity is essential for understanding the human brain. While fMRI methods have successfully reconstructed static images, fMRI-to-video reconstruction faces challenges due to the need for capturing spatiotemporal dynamics like motion and scene transitions. Recent approaches have improved semantic and perceptual alignment but struggle to integrate coarse fMRI data with detailed visual features. Inspired by the hierarchical organization of the visual system, we propose NEURONS, a novel framework that decouples learning into four correlated sub-tasks: key object segmentation, concept recognition, scene description, and blurry video reconstruction. This approach simulates the visual cortex's functional specialization, allowing the model to capture diverse video content. In the inference stage, NEURONS generates robust conditioning signals for a pre-trained text-to-video diffusion model to reconstruct the videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NEURONS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving solid improvements in video consistency (26.6%) and semantic-level accuracy (19.1%). Notably, NEURONS shows a strong functional correlation with the visual cortex, highlighting its potential for brain-computer interfaces and clinical applications. Code and model weights are available at: https://github.com/xmed-lab/NEURONS.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed sentiment analysis, yet balancing accuracy, efficiency, and explainability remains a critical challenge. This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of DeepSeek-R1--an open-source reasoning model--against OpenAI's GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini. We test the full 671B model and its distilled variants, systematically documenting few-shot learning curves. Our experiments show DeepSeek-R1 achieves a 91.39\% F1 score on 5-class sentiment and 99.31\% accuracy on binary tasks with just 5 shots, an eightfold improvement in few-shot efficiency over GPT-4o. Architecture-specific distillation effects emerge, where a 32B Qwen2.5-based model outperforms the 70B Llama-based variant by 6.69 percentage points. While its reasoning process reduces throughput, DeepSeek-R1 offers superior explainability via transparent, step-by-step traces, establishing it as a powerful, interpretable open-source alternative.

Abstract: This study characterizes GPU resilience in Delta HPC, a large-scale AI system that consists of 1,056 A100 and H100 GPUs, with over 1,300 petaflops of peak throughput. Delta HPC is operated by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. We used 2.5 years of operational data (11.7 million GPU hours) on GPU errors. Our major findings include: (i) H100 GPU memory resilience is worse than A100 GPU memory, with 3.2x lower per-GPU MTBE for memory errors, (ii) The GPU memory error-recovery mechanisms on H100 GPUs are insufficient to handle the increased memory capacity, (iii) H100 GPUs demonstrate significantly improved GPU hardware resilience over A100 GPUs with respect to critical hardware components, (iv) GPU errors on both A100 and H100 GPUs frequently result in job failures due to the lack of robust recovery mechanisms at the application level, and (v) We project the impact of GPU node availability on larger-scales and find that significant overprovisioning of 5% is necessary to handle GPU failures.

Abstract: The increasing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in digital ecosystems has reshaped privacy dynamics, particularly for young digital citizens navigating data-driven environments. This study explores evolving privacy concerns across three key stakeholder groups, digital citizens (ages 16-19), parents/educators, and AI professionals, and assesses differences in data ownership, trust, transparency, parental mediation, education, and risk-benefit perceptions. Employing a grounded theory methodology, this research synthesizes insights from 482 participants through structured surveys, qualitative interviews, and focus groups. The findings reveal distinct privacy expectations: Young users emphasize autonomy and digital freedom, while parents and educators advocate for regulatory oversight and AI literacy programs. AI professionals, in contrast, prioritize the balance between ethical system design and technological efficiency. The data further highlights gaps in AI literacy and transparency, emphasizing the need for comprehensive, stakeholder-driven privacy frameworks that accommodate diverse user needs. Using comparative thematic analysis, this study identifies key tensions in privacy governance and develops the novel Privacy-Ethics Alignment in AI (PEA-AI) model, which structures privacy decision-making as a dynamic negotiation between stakeholders. By systematically analyzing themes such as transparency, user control, risk perception, and parental mediation, this research provides a scalable, adaptive foundation for AI governance, ensuring that privacy protections evolve alongside emerging AI technologies and youth-centric digital interactions.

Abstract: Temporal Video Grounding (TVG), the task of locating specific video segments based on language queries, is a core challenge in long-form video understanding. While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown early promise in tackling TVG through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), their abilities to generalize remain limited. To address this, we propose a novel post-training framework that enhances the generalization capabilities of LVLMs via reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, our contributions span three key directions: (1) Time-R1: we introduce a reasoning-guided post-training framework via RL with verifiable reward to enhance the capabilities of LVLMs on the TVG task. (2) TimeRFT: we explore data-efficient post-training strategies on our curated RL-friendly dataset, which trains the model to progressively comprehend difficult samples, leading to better generalization. (3) TVGBench: we carefully construct a small yet comprehensive benchmark for LVLM evaluation, assessing 11 types of queries and featuring balanced distributions across both videos and queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Time-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple downstream datasets using only 2.5K training data, while improving its general video understanding capabilities.

arXiv:2503.15426v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at various image-related tasks, they encounter challenges in precisely aligning coordinates with spatial information within images, particularly in position-aware tasks such as visual grounding. This limitation arises from two key factors. First, MLLMs lack explicit spatial references, making it difficult to associate textual descriptions with precise image locations. Second, their feature extraction processes prioritize global context over fine-grained spatial details, leading to weak localization capability. To address these issues, we introduce VPP-LLaVA, an MLLM enhanced with Visual Position Prompt (VPP) to improve its grounding capability. VPP-LLaVA integrates two complementary mechanisms: the global VPP overlays a learnable, axis-like tensor onto the input image to provide structured spatial cues, while the local VPP incorporates position-aware queries to support fine-grained localization.To effectively train our model with spatial guidance, we further introduce VPP-SFT, a curated dataset of 0.6M high-quality visual grounding samples. Designed in a compact format, it enables efficient training and is significantly smaller than datasets used by other MLLMs (e.g., ~21M samples in MiniGPT-v2), yet still provides a strong performance boost. The resulting model, VPP-LLaVA, not only achieves state-of-the-art results on standard visual grounding benchmarks but also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to challenging unseen datasets. Code and dataset will be released upon acceptance at https://github.com/WayneTomas/VPP-LLaVA.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have emerged as a leading architecture for natural language processing, natural language generation, and image generation tasks. A fundamental element of the transformer architecture is self-attention, which allows the model to capture intricate dependencies within the data. However, the self-attention mechanism also incurs significant computational and memory costs, particularly for long sequences.
  In this paper, we introduce ATTENTION2D, a novel approach that exploits parallelism along two dimensions - query and key/value - of the self-attention operation. This method enables efficient distribution and parallelization of computations across multiple devices. Our approach facilitates asymptotically faster training and inference phases compared to previous methods, without relying on approximations or incurring additional computational or memory overheads. Furthermore, unlike existing techniques that struggle to scale with an increasing number of processing units, our approach effectively scales with additional processing units.
  Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our method in improving communication efficiency and scalability. Compared to Ring Attention, our approach demonstrated up to a 5x performance boost on a GPT-3-like model using 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs across 16 nodes, and up to a 9.4x performance boost on 64 NVIDIA H100 GPUs across 64 nodes.

<title>Automating Adjudication of Cardiovascular Events Using Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks and strokes, remain a leading cause of mortality globally, necessitating meticulous monitoring and adjudication in clinical trials. This process, traditionally performed manually by clinical experts, is time-consuming, resource-intensive, and prone to inter-reviewer variability, potentially introducing bias and hindering trial progress. This study addresses these critical limitations by presenting a novel framework for automating the adjudication of cardiovascular events in clinical trials using Large Language Models (LLMs). We developed a two-stage approach: first, employing an LLM-based pipeline for event information extraction from unstructured clinical data and second, using an LLM-based adjudication process guided by a Tree of Thoughts approach and clinical endpoint committee (CEC) guidelines. Using cardiovascular event-specific clinical trial data, the framework achieved an F1-score of 0.82 for event extraction and an accuracy of 0.68 for adjudication. Furthermore, we introduce the CLEART score, a novel, automated metric specifically designed for evaluating the quality of AI-generated clinical reasoning in adjudicating cardiovascular events. This approach demonstrates significant potential for substantially reducing adjudication time and costs while maintaining high-quality, consistent, and auditable outcomes in clinical trials. The reduced variability and enhanced standardization also allow for faster identification and mitigation of risks associated with cardiovascular therapies.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems increasingly operate in Real-world environments, the integration of multi-modal data sources such as vision, language, and audio presents both unprecedented opportunities and critical challenges for achieving trustworthy intelligence. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that unifies federated learning with explainable multi-modal reasoning to ensure trustworthiness in decentralized, dynamic settings. Our approach, called FedMM-X (Federated Multi-Modal Explainable Intelligence), leverages cross-modal consistency checks, client-level interpretability mechanisms, and dynamic trust calibration to address challenges posed by data heterogeneity, modality imbalance, and out-of-distribution generalization. Through rigorous evaluation across federated multi-modal benchmarks involving vision-language tasks, we demonstrate improved performance in both accuracy and interpretability while reducing vulnerabilities to adversarial and spurious correlations. Further, we introduce a novel trust score aggregation method to quantify global model reliability under dynamic client participation. Our findings pave the way toward developing robust, interpretable, and socially responsible AI systems in Real-world environments.

Abstract: Can Visual Language Models (VLMs) effectively capture human visual preferences? This work addresses this question by training VLMs to think about preferences at test time, employing reinforcement learning methods inspired by DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI O1. Using datasets such as ImageReward and Human Preference Score v2 (HPSv2), our models achieve accuracies of 64.9% on the ImageReward test set (trained on ImageReward official split) and 65.4% on HPSv2 (trained on approximately 25% of its data). These results match traditional encoder-based models while providing transparent reasoning and enhanced generalization. This approach allows to use not only rich VLM world knowledge, but also its potential to think, yielding interpretable outcomes that help decision-making processes. By demonstrating that human visual preferences reasonable by current VLMs, we introduce efficient soft-reward strategies for image ranking, outperforming simplistic selection or scoring methods. This reasoning capability enables VLMs to rank arbitrary images-regardless of aspect ratio or complexity-thereby potentially amplifying the effectiveness of visual Preference Optimization. By reducing the need for extensive markup while improving reward generalization and explainability, our findings can be a strong mile-stone that will enhance text-to-vision models even further.

arXiv:2503.22968v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Korean large language models (LLMs) have driven numerous benchmarks and evaluation methods, yet inconsistent protocols cause up to 10 p.p performance gaps across institutions. Overcoming these reproducibility gaps does not mean enforcing a one-size-fits-all evaluation. Rather, effective benchmarking requires diverse experimental approaches and a framework robust enough to support them. To this end, we introduce HRET (Haerae Evaluation Toolkit), an open-source, registry-based framework that unifies Korean LLM assessment. HRET integrates major Korean benchmarks, multiple inference backends, and multi-method evaluation, with language consistency enforcement to ensure genuine Korean outputs. Its modular registry design also enables rapid incorporation of new datasets, methods, and backends, ensuring the toolkit adapts to evolving research needs. Beyond standard accuracy metrics, HRET incorporates Korean-focused output analyses-morphology-aware Type-Token Ratio (TTR) for evaluating lexical diversity and systematic keyword-omission detection for identifying missing concepts-to provide diagnostic insights into language-specific behaviors. These targeted analyses help researchers pinpoint morphological and semantic shortcomings in model outputs, guiding focused improvements in Korean LLM development.

arXiv:2504.04528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: ML-supported decisions, such as ordering tests or determining preventive custody, often involve binary classification based on probabilistic forecasts. Evaluation frameworks for such forecasts typically consider whether to prioritize independent-decision metrics (e.g., Accuracy) or top-K metrics (e.g., Precision@K), and whether to focus on fixed thresholds or threshold-agnostic measures like AUC-ROC. We highlight that a consequentialist perspective, long advocated by decision theorists, should naturally favor evaluations that support independent decisions using a mixture of thresholds given their prevalence, such as Brier scores and Log loss. However, our empirical analysis reveals a strong preference for top-K metrics or fixed thresholds in evaluations at major conferences like ICML, FAccT, and CHIL. To address this gap, we use this decision-theoretic framework to map evaluation metrics to their optimal use cases, along with a Python package, briertools, to promote the broader adoption of Brier scores. In doing so, we also uncover new theoretical connections, including a reconciliation between the Brier Score and Decision Curve Analysis, which clarifies and responds to a longstanding critique by (Assel, et al. 2017) regarding the clinical utility of proper scoring rules.

Abstract: Quantizing large language models (LLMs) to 1-bit precision significantly reduces computational costs, but existing quantization techniques suffer from noticeable performance degradation when using weight and activation precisions below 4 bits (W4A4). In this paper, we propose a post-training quantization framework with W(1+1)A(1*4) configuration, where weights are quantized to 1 bit with an additional 1 bit for fine-grain grouping and activations are quantized to 1 bit with a 4-fold increase in the number of channels. For weight quantization, we propose utilizing Hessian-aware fine-grained grouping along with an EM-based quantization scheme. For activation quantization, we decompose INT4-quantized activations into a 4 * INT1 format equivalently and simultaneously smooth the scaling factors based on quantization errors, which further reduces the quantization errors in activations. Our method surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM quantization baselines on W2A4 across multiple tasks, pushing the boundaries of existing LLM quantization methods toward fully binarized models. Code is available at https://github.com/JimmyCrave/LLM-PTQ-binarization.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating high-quality images from textual prompts. However, their ability to store vast amounts of knowledge raises concerns in scenarios where selective forgetting is necessary, such as removing copyrighted content, reducing biases, or eliminating harmful concepts. While existing unlearning methods can remove certain concepts, they struggle with multi-concept forgetting due to instability, residual knowledge persistence, and generation quality degradation. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Dynamic Mask coupled with Concept-Aware Loss}, a novel unlearning framework designed for multi-concept forgetting in diffusion models. Our \textbf{Dynamic Mask} mechanism adaptively updates gradient masks based on current optimization states, allowing selective weight modifications that prevent interference with unrelated knowledge. Additionally, our \textbf{Concept-Aware Loss} explicitly guides the unlearning process by enforcing semantic consistency through superclass alignment, while a regularization loss based on knowledge distillation ensures that previously unlearned concepts remain forgotten during sequential unlearning. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our approach. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing unlearning techniques in forgetting effectiveness, output fidelity, and semantic coherence, particularly in multi-concept scenarios. Our work provides a principled and flexible framework for stable and high-fidelity unlearning in generative models. The code will be released publicly.

Abstract: Recent smaller language models such Phi-3.5 and Phi-4 rely on synthetic data generated using larger Language models. Questions remain about leveraging synthetic data for other use cases, such as adapting LLMs to specific domains. A key limitation of synthetic data is low diversity, which negatively impacts its downstream applicability for improving other models. To address this, we propose MetaSynth, a method for generating synthetic data that enhances diversity through meta-prompting, where a language model orchestrates multiple "expert" LLM agents to collaboratively generate data. Using only 25 million tokens of synthetic data generated with MetaSynth, we successfully adapt a well-trained LLM (Mistral-7B-v0.3) to two specialized domains-Finance and Biomedicine-without compromising the capabilities of the resulting model in general tasks. In addition, we evaluate the diversity of our synthetic data using seven automated metrics, and find that it approaches the diversity of LLM pre-training corpora.
  Continually pre-training Mistral-7B-v0.3 with MetaSynth notably outperforms the base LLM, showing improvements of up to 4.08% in Finance and 13.75% in Biomedicine. The same model shows degraded performance when trained on data generated using a template prompt, even when the template includes prior generations and varying In-Context exemplars of real data. Our findings suggest that a few million tokens of diverse synthetic data without mixing any real data, is sufficient for effective domain adaptation when using MetaSynth.

Abstract: As large language models are increasingly utilized in real-world applications, guarantees of task-specific metrics are essential for their reliable deployment. Previous studies have introduced various criteria of conformal uncertainty grounded in split conformal prediction, which offer user-specified correctness coverage. However, existing frameworks often fail to identify uncertainty data outliers that violate the exchangeability assumption, leading to unbounded miscoverage rates and unactionable prediction sets. In this paper, we propose a novel approach termed Selective Conformal Uncertainty (SConU), which, for the first time, implements significance tests, by developing two conformal p-values that are instrumental in determining whether a given sample deviates from the uncertainty distribution of the calibration set at a specific manageable risk level. Our approach not only facilitates rigorous management of miscoverage rates across both single-domain and interdisciplinary contexts, but also enhances the efficiency of predictions. Furthermore, we comprehensively analyze the components of the conformal procedures, aiming to approximate conditional coverage, particularly in high-stakes question-answering tasks.

Abstract: The rise of AI, especially Large Language Models, presents challenges and opportunities to integrate such technology into the classroom. AI has the potential to revolutionize education by helping teaching staff with various tasks, such as personalizing their teaching methods, but it also raises concerns, for example, about the degradation of student-teacher interactions and user privacy. Based on interviews with teaching staff, this paper introduces INSIGHT, a proof of concept to combine various AI tools to assist teaching staff and students in the process of solving exercises. INSIGHT has a modular design that allows it to be integrated into various higher education courses. We analyze students' questions to an LLM by extracting keywords, which we use to dynamically build an FAQ from students' questions and provide new insights for the teaching staff to use for more personalized face-to-face support. Future work could build upon INSIGHT by using the collected data to provide adaptive learning and adjust content based on student progress and learning styles to offer a more interactive and inclusive learning experience.

Abstract: Enhancing the robustness of object detection systems under adverse weather conditions is crucial for the advancement of autonomous driving technology. This study presents a novel approach leveraging the diffusion model Instruct Pix2Pix to develop prompting methodologies that generate realistic datasets with weather-based augmentations aiming to mitigate the impact of adverse weather on the perception capabilities of state-of-the-art object detection models, including Faster R-CNN and YOLOv10. Experiments were conducted in two environments, in the CARLA simulator where an initial evaluation of the proposed data augmentation was provided, and then on the real-world image data sets BDD100K and ACDC demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach in real environments.
  The key contributions of this work are twofold: (1) identifying and quantifying the performance gap in object detection models under challenging weather conditions, and (2) demonstrating how tailored data augmentation strategies can significantly enhance the robustness of these models. This research establishes a solid foundation for improving the reliability of perception systems in demanding environmental scenarios, and provides a pathway for future advancements in autonomous driving.

Abstract: This study introduces an enhanced approach to video super-resolution by extending ordinary Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR) Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) structure to handle spatio-temporal data. While SRGAN has proven effective for single-image enhancement, its design does not account for the temporal continuity required in video processing. To address this, a modified framework that incorporates 3D Non-Local Blocks is proposed, which is enabling the model to capture relationships across both spatial and temporal dimensions. An experimental training pipeline is developed, based on patch-wise learning and advanced data degradation techniques, to simulate real-world video conditions and learn from both local and global structures and details. This helps the model generalize better and maintain stability across varying video content while maintaining the general structure besides the pixel-wise correctness. Two model variants-one larger and one more lightweight-are presented to explore the trade-offs between performance and efficiency. The results demonstrate improved temporal coherence, sharper textures, and fewer visual artifacts compared to traditional single-image methods. This work contributes to the development of practical, learning-based solutions for video enhancement tasks, with potential applications in streaming, gaming, and digital restoration.

Abstract: Lightweight Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are indispensable for resource-constrained applications. The prevailing approach to aligning vision and language models involves freezing both the vision encoder and the language model while training small connector modules. However, this strategy heavily depends on the intrinsic capabilities of the language model, which can be suboptimal for lightweight models with limited representational capacity. In this work, we investigate this alignment bottleneck through the lens of mutual information, demonstrating that the constrained capacity of the language model inherently limits the Effective Mutual Information (EMI) between multimodal inputs and outputs, thereby compromising alignment quality. To address this challenge, we propose TinyAlign, a novel framework inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which strategically retrieves relevant context from a memory bank to enrich multimodal inputs and enhance their alignment. Extensive empirical evaluations reveal that TinyAlign significantly reduces training loss, accelerates convergence, and enhances task performance. Remarkably, it allows models to achieve baseline-level performance with only 40\% of the fine-tuning data, highlighting exceptional data efficiency. Our work thus offers a practical pathway for developing more capable lightweight VLMs while introducing a fresh theoretical lens to better understand and address alignment bottlenecks in constrained multimodal systems.

Abstract: Predictive Coding (PC) offers a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation for neural network training, yet struggles with deeper architectures. This paper identifies the root cause: an inherent signal decay problem where gradients attenuate exponentially with depth, becoming computationally negligible due to numerical precision constraints. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce Error Optimization (EO), a novel reparameterization that preserves PC's theoretical properties while eliminating signal decay. By optimizing over prediction errors rather than states, EO enables signals to reach all layers simultaneously and without attenuation, converging orders of magnitude faster than standard PC. Experiments across multiple architectures and datasets demonstrate that EO matches backpropagation's performance even for deeper models where conventional PC struggles. Besides practical improvements, our work provides theoretical insight into PC dynamics and establishes a foundation for scaling biologically-inspired learning to deeper architectures on digital hardware and beyond.

Abstract: Audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) have recently made great strides in understanding and processing audio inputs. These models are typically adapted from text-based large language models (LLMs) through additional training on audio-related tasks. However, this adaptation process presents two major limitations. First, ALLMs often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where crucial textual capabilities like instruction-following are lost after training on audio data. In some cases, models may even hallucinate sounds that are not present in the input audio, raising concerns about reliability. Second, achieving cross-modal alignment between audio and language typically relies on large collections of task-specific question-answer pairs for instruction tuning, making it resource-intensive. To address these issues, previous works have leveraged the backbone LLMs to synthesize general-purpose, caption-style alignment data. In this paper, we propose a data generation framework that produces contrastive-like training data, designed to enhance ALLMs' ability to differentiate between present and absent sounds. We further extend our approach to multi-audio scenarios, enabling the model to either explain differences between audio inputs or produce unified captions that describe all inputs, thereby enhancing audio-language alignment. We refer to the entire ALLM training framework as bootstrapping audio-language alignment via synthetic data generation from backbone LLMs (BALSa). Experimental results indicate that our method effectively mitigates audio hallucinations while reliably maintaining strong performance on audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks, as well as instruction-following skills. Moreover, incorporating multi-audio training further enhances the model's comprehension and reasoning capabilities. Overall, BALSa offers an efficient and scalable approach to developing ALLMs.

Abstract: In this work, we present WeatherEdit, a novel weather editing pipeline for generating realistic weather effects with controllable types and severity in 3D scenes. Our approach is structured into two key components: weather background editing and weather particle construction. For weather background editing, we introduce an all-in-one adapter that integrates multiple weather styles into a single pretrained diffusion model, enabling the generation of diverse weather effects in 2D image backgrounds. During inference, we design a Temporal-View (TV-) attention mechanism that follows a specific order to aggregate temporal and spatial information, ensuring consistent editing across multi-frame and multi-view images. To construct the weather particles, we first reconstruct a 3D scene using the edited images and then introduce a dynamic 4D Gaussian field to generate snowflakes, raindrops and fog in the scene. The attributes and dynamics of these particles are precisely controlled through physical-based modelling and simulation, ensuring realistic weather representation and flexible severity adjustments. Finally, we integrate the 4D Gaussian field with the 3D scene to render consistent and highly realistic weather effects. Experiments on multiple driving datasets demonstrate that WeatherEdit can generate diverse weather effects with controllable condition severity, highlighting its potential for autonomous driving simulation in adverse weather.

Abstract: Recent advances in expressive text-to-speech (TTS) have introduced diverse methods based on style embedding extracted from reference speech. However, synthesizing high-quality expressive speech remains challenging. We propose Spotlight-TTS, which exclusively emphasizes style via voiced-aware style extraction and style direction adjustment. Voiced-aware style extraction focuses on voiced regions highly related to style while maintaining continuity across different speech regions to improve expressiveness. We adjust the direction of the extracted style for optimal integration into the TTS model, which improves speech quality. Experimental results demonstrate that Spotlight-TTS achieves superior performance compared to baseline models in terms of expressiveness, overall speech quality, and style transfer capability. Our audio samples are publicly available.

Abstract: Manufacturing environments are becoming more complex and unpredictable due to factors such as demand variations and shorter product lifespans. This complexity requires real-time decision-making and adaptation to disruptions. Traditional control approaches highlight the need for advanced control strategies capable of overcoming unforeseen challenges, as they demonstrate limitations in responsiveness within dynamic industrial settings. Multi-agent systems address these challenges through decentralization of decision-making, enabling systems to respond dynamically to operational changes. However, current multi-agent systems encounter challenges related to real-time adaptation, context-aware decision-making, and the dynamic exploration of resource capabilities. Large language models provide the possibility to overcome these limitations through context-aware decision-making capabilities. This paper introduces a large language model-enabled control architecture for multi-agent manufacturing systems to dynamically explore resource capabilities in response to real-time disruptions. A simulation-based case study demonstrates that the proposed architecture improves system resilience and flexibility. The case study findings show improved throughput and efficient resource utilization compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained generative models with Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as an effective approach for aligning outputs more closely with nuanced human preferences. In this paper, we investigate the application of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune next-scale visual autoregressive (VAR) models. Our empirical results demonstrate that this approach enables alignment to intricate reward signals derived from aesthetic predictors and CLIP embeddings, significantly enhancing image quality and enabling precise control over the generation style. Interestingly, by leveraging CLIP, our method can help VAR models generalize beyond their initial ImageNet distribution: through RL-driven exploration, these models can generate images aligned with prompts referencing image styles that were absent during pre-training. In summary, we show that RL-based fine-tuning is both efficient and effective for VAR models, benefiting particularly from their fast inference speeds, which are advantageous for online sampling, an aspect that poses significant challenges for diffusion-based alternatives.

<title>Bridging Subjective and Objective QoE: Operator-Level Aggregation Using LLM-Based Comment Analysis and Network MOS Comparison</title>

arXiv:2506.00924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a dual-layer framework for network operator-side quality of experience (QoE) assessment that integrates both objective network modeling and subjective user perception extracted from live-streaming platforms. On the objective side, we develop a machine learning model trained on mean opinion scores (MOS) computed via the ITU-T P.1203 reference implementation, allowing accurate prediction of user-perceived video quality using only network parameters such as packet loss, delay, jitter, and throughput without reliance on video content or client-side instrumentation. On the subjective side, we present a semantic filtering and scoring pipeline that processes user comments from live streams to extract performance-related feedback. A large language model is used to assign scalar MOS scores to filtered comments in a deterministic and reproducible manner. To support scalable and interpretable analysis, we construct a labeled dataset of 47,894 live-stream comments, of which about 34,000 are identified as QoE-relevant through multi-layer semantic filtering. Each comment is enriched with simulated Internet Service Provider attribution and temporally aligned using synthetic timestamps in 5-min intervals. The resulting dataset enables operator-level aggregation and time-series analysis of user-perceived quality. A delta MOS metric is proposed to measure each Internet service provider's deviation from platform-wide sentiment, allowing detection of localized degradations even in the absence of direct network telemetry. A controlled outage simulation confirms the framework's effectiveness in identifying service disruptions through comment-based trends alone. The system provides each operator with its own subjective MOS and the global platform average per interval, enabling real-time interpretation of performance deviations and comparison with objective network-based QoE estimates.

Abstract: This paper presents Symbiosis of Agents, is a large-scale installation by Baoyang Chen (baoyangchen.com), that embeds AI-driven robots in an immersive, mirror-lined arena, probing the tension between machine agency and artistic authorship. Drawing on early cybernetics, rule-based conceptual art, and seminal robotic works, it orchestrates fluid exchanges among robotic arms, quadruped machines, their environment, and the public. A three tier faith system pilots the ecology: micro-level adaptive tactics, meso-level narrative drives, and a macro-level prime directive. This hierarchy lets behaviors evolve organically in response to environmental cues and even a viewer's breath, turning spectators into co-authors of the unfolding drama. Framed by a speculative terraforming scenario that recalls the historical exploitation of marginalized labor, the piece asks who bears responsibility in AI-mediated futures. Choreographed motion, AI-generated scripts, reactive lighting, and drifting fog cast the robots as collaborators rather than tools, forging a living, emergent artwork. Exhibited internationally, Symbiosis of Agents shows how cybernetic feedback, robotic experimentation, and conceptual rule-making can converge to redefine agency, authorship, and ethics in contemporary art.

Abstract: Modern chip design is complex, and there is a crucial need for early-stage prediction of key design-quality metrics like timing and routing congestion directly from Verilog code (a commonly used programming language for hardware design). It is especially important yet complex to predict individual lines of code that cause timing violations or downstream routing congestion. Prior works have tried approaches like converting Verilog into an intermediate graph representation and using LLM embeddings alongside other features to predict module-level quality, but did not consider line-level quality prediction. We propose VeriLoC, the first method that predicts design quality directly from Verilog at both the line- and module-level. To this end, VeriLoC leverages recent Verilog code-generation LLMs to extract local line-level and module-level embeddings, and train downstream classifiers/regressors on concatenations of these embeddings. VeriLoC achieves high F1-scores of 0.86-0.95 for line-level congestion and timing prediction, and reduces the mean average percentage error from 14% - 18% for SOTA methods down to only 4%. We believe that VeriLoC embeddings and insights from our work will also be of value for other predictive and optimization tasks for complex hardware design.

<title>FZOO: Fast Zeroth-Order Optimizer for Fine-Tuning Large Language Models towards Adam-Scale Speed</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.09034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) often faces GPU memory bottlenecks: the backward pass of first-order optimizers like Adam increases memory usage to more than 10 times the inference level (e.g., 633 GB for OPT-30B). Zeroth-order (ZO) optimizers avoid this cost by estimating gradients only from forward passes, yet existing methods like MeZO usually require many more steps to converge. Can this trade-off between speed and memory in ZO be fundamentally improved? Normalized-SGD demonstrates strong empirical performance with greater memory efficiency than Adam. In light of this, we introduce FZOO, a Fast Zeroth-Order Optimizer toward Adam-Scale Speed. FZOO reduces the total forward passes needed for convergence by employing batched one-sided estimates that adapt step sizes based on the standard deviation of batch losses. It also accelerates per-batch computation through the use of Rademacher random vector perturbations coupled with CUDA's parallel processing. Extensive experiments on diverse models, including RoBERTa-large, OPT (350M-66B), Phi-2, and Llama3, across 11 tasks validate FZOO's effectiveness. On average, FZOO outperforms MeZO by 3 percent in accuracy while requiring 3 times fewer forward passes. For RoBERTa-large, FZOO achieves average improvements of 5.6 percent in accuracy and an 18 times reduction in forward passes compared to MeZO, achieving convergence speeds comparable to Adam. We also provide theoretical analysis proving FZOO's formal equivalence to a normalized-SGD update rule and its convergence guarantees. FZOO integrates smoothly into PEFT techniques, enabling even larger memory savings. Overall, our results make single-GPU, high-speed, full-parameter fine-tuning practical and point toward future work on memory-efficient pre-training.

Abstract: The growing gap between the increasing complexity of large language models (LLMs) and the limited computational budgets of edge devices poses a key challenge for efficient on-device inference, despite gradual improvements in hardware capabilities. Existing strategies, such as aggressive quantization, pruning, or remote inference, trade accuracy for efficiency or lead to substantial cost burdens. This position paper introduces a new framework that leverages speculative decoding, previously viewed primarily as a decoding acceleration technique for autoregressive generation of LLMs, as a promising approach specifically adapted for edge computing by orchestrating computation across heterogeneous devices. We propose \acronym, a framework that allows lightweight edge devices to draft multiple candidate tokens locally using diverse draft models, while a single, shared edge server verifies the tokens utilizing a more precise target model. To further increase the efficiency of verification, the edge server batch the diverse verification requests from devices. This approach supports device heterogeneity and reduces server-side memory footprint by sharing the same upstream target model across multiple devices. Our initial experiments with Jetson Orin Nano, Raspberry Pi 4B/5, and an edge server equipped with 4 Nvidia A100 GPUs indicate substantial benefits: 2.2 more system throughput, 2.8 more system capacity, and better cost efficiency, all without sacrificing model accuracy.

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is a critical step for enhancing the instruction-following capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and adapting them to specialized domains. However, SFT often leads to a degradation of the model's general abilities, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. This problem is exacerbated when third-party practitioners fine-tune open-source models, as the original SFT data is typically not available. To address this challenge, we propose a novel and cost-effective SFT method that effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting without requiring access to the original SFT data. Our approach first reconstructs the likely instruction distribution of the base model. It then employs a multi-model generation and filtering pipeline to synthesize a high-quality general-purpose dataset. This synthetic dataset is mixed with new, domain-specific data for fine-tuning. Experimental results show that our method not only preserves the model's capabilities in general domains but also improves task-specific performance, outperforming baselines that use publicly available SFT datasets.

Abstract: Equivariant diffusion models have achieved impressive performance in 3D molecule generation. These models incorporate Euclidean symmetries of 3D molecules by utilizing an SE(3)-equivariant denoising network. However, specialized equivariant architectures limit the scalability and efficiency of diffusion models. In this paper, we propose an approach that relaxes such equivariance constraints. Specifically, our approach learns a sample-dependent SO(3) transformation for each molecule to construct an aligned latent space. A non-equivariant diffusion model is then trained over the aligned representations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs significantly better than previously reported non-equivariant models. It yields sample quality comparable to state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion models and offers improved training and sampling efficiency. Our code is available at https://github.com/skeletondyh/RADM

Abstract: Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) are powerful tools for the formal verification of mathematical proofs down to the axiom level. However, their lack of a natural language interface remains a significant limitation. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enhanced the understanding of natural language inputs, paving the way for autoformalization - the process of translating natural language proofs into formal proofs that can be verified. Despite these advancements, existing autoformalization approaches are limited to verifying complete proofs and lack the capability for finer, sentence-level verification. To address this gap, we propose StepProof, a novel autoformalization method designed for granular, step-by-step verification. StepProof breaks down complete proofs into multiple verifiable subproofs, enabling sentence-level verification. Experimental results demonstrate that StepProof significantly improves proof success rates and efficiency compared to traditional methods. Additionally, we found that minor manual adjustments to the natural language proofs, tailoring them for step-level verification, further enhanced StepProof's performance in autoformalization.

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-text large language models (LLMs) have opened new possibilities for music understanding and generation. However, existing benchmarks are limited in scope, often relying on simplified tasks or multi-choice evaluations that fail to reflect the complexity of real-world music analysis. We reinterpret a broad range of traditional MIR annotations as instruction-following formats and introduce CMI-Bench, a comprehensive music instruction following benchmark designed to evaluate audio-text LLMs on a diverse set of music information retrieval (MIR) tasks. These include genre classification, emotion regression, emotion tagging, instrument classification, pitch estimation, key detection, lyrics transcription, melody extraction, vocal technique recognition, instrument performance technique detection, music tagging, music captioning, and (down)beat tracking: reflecting core challenges in MIR research. Unlike previous benchmarks, CMI-Bench adopts standardized evaluation metrics consistent with previous state-of-the-art MIR models, ensuring direct comparability with supervised approaches. We provide an evaluation toolkit supporting all open-source audio-textual LLMs, including LTU, Qwen-audio, SALMONN, MusiLingo, etc. Experiment results reveal significant performance gaps between LLMs and supervised models, along with their culture, chronological and gender bias, highlighting the potential and limitations of current models in addressing MIR tasks. CMI-Bench establishes a unified foundation for evaluating music instruction following, driving progress in music-aware LLMs.

Abstract: Language models can retain dangerous knowledge and skills even after extensive safety fine-tuning, posing both misuse and misalignment risks. Recent studies show that even specialized unlearning methods can be easily reversed. To address this, we systematically evaluate many existing and novel components of unlearning methods and identify ones crucial for irreversible unlearning.
  We introduce Disruption Masking, a technique in which we only allow updating weights, where the signs of the unlearning gradient and the retaining gradient are the same. This ensures all updates are non-disruptive.
  Additionally, we identify the need for normalizing the unlearning gradients, and also confirm the usefulness of meta-learning. We combine these insights into MUDMAN (Meta-Unlearning with Disruption Masking and Normalization) and validate its effectiveness at preventing the recovery of dangerous capabilities. MUDMAN outperforms the prior TAR method by 40%, setting a new state-of-the-art for robust unlearning.

Abstract: Recent work shows that Sparse Autoencoders (SAE) applied to large language model (LLM) layers have neurons corresponding to interpretable concepts. These SAE neurons can be modified to align generated outputs, but only towards pre-identified topics and with some parameter tuning. Our approach leverages the observational and modification properties of SAEs to enable alignment for any topic. This method 1) scores each SAE neuron by its semantic similarity to an alignment text and uses them to 2) modify SAE-layer-level outputs by emphasizing topic-aligned neurons. We assess the alignment capabilities of this approach on diverse public topic datasets including Amazon reviews, Medicine, and Sycophancy, across the currently available open-source LLMs and SAE pairs (GPT2 and Gemma) with multiple SAEs configurations. Experiments aligning to medical prompts reveal several benefits over fine-tuning, including increased average language acceptability (0.25 vs. 0.5), reduced training time across multiple alignment topics (333.6s vs. 62s), and acceptable inference time for many applications (+0.00092s/token). Our open-source code is available at github.com/IBM/sae-steering.

<title>VFEFL: Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning against Malicious Clients via Verifiable Functional Encryption</title>

Abstract: Federated learning is a promising distributed learning paradigm that enables collaborative model training without exposing local client data, thereby protect data privacy. However, it also brings new threats and challenges. The advancement of model inversion attacks has rendered the plaintext transmission of local models insecure, while the distributed nature of federated learning makes it particularly vulnerable to attacks raised by malicious clients. To protect data privacy and prevent malicious client attacks, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving federated learning framework based on verifiable functional encryption, without a non-colluding dual-server setup or additional trusted third-party. Specifically, we propose a novel decentralized verifiable functional encryption (DVFE) scheme that enables the verification of specific relationships over multi-dimensional ciphertexts. This scheme is formally treated, in terms of definition, security model and security proof. Furthermore, based on the proposed DVFE scheme, we design a privacy-preserving federated learning framework VFEFL that incorporates a novel robust aggregation rule to detect malicious clients, enabling the effective training of high-accuracy models under adversarial settings. Finally, we provide formal analysis and empirical evaluation of the proposed schemes. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves the desired privacy protection, robustness, verifiability and fidelity, while eliminating the reliance on non-colluding dual-server settings or trusted third parties required by existing methods.

<title>Value-Free Policy Optimization via Reward Partitioning</title>

Abstract: Single-trajectory reinforcement learning (RL) methods aim to optimize policies from datasets consisting of (prompt, response, reward) triplets, where scalar rewards are directly available. This supervision format is highly practical, as it mirrors real-world human feedback, such as thumbs-up/down signals, and avoids the need for structured preference annotations. In contrast, pairwise preference-based methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) rely on datasets with both preferred and dispreferred responses, which are harder to construct and less natural to collect. Among single-trajectory approaches, Direct Reward Optimization (DRO) has shown strong empirical performance due to its simplicity and stability. However, DRO requires approximating a value function, which introduces several limitations: high off-policy variance, coupling between policy and value learning, and a lack of absolute supervision on the policy itself. We introduce Reward Partitioning Optimization (RPO), a new method that resolves these limitations by removing the need to model the value function. Instead, RPO normalizes observed rewards using a partitioning approach estimated directly from data. This leads to a straightforward supervised learning objective on the policy, with no auxiliary models and no joint optimization. RPO provides direct and stable supervision on the policy, making it robust and easy to implement in practice. We validate RPO on scalar-feedback language modeling tasks using Flan-T5 encoder-decoder models. Our results demonstrate that RPO outperforms existing single-trajectory baselines such as DRO and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO). These findings confirm that RPO is a simple, effective, and theoretically grounded method for single-trajectory policy optimization.

Abstract: Machine learning-based decision support systems are increasingly deployed in clinical settings, where probabilistic scoring functions are used to inform and prioritize patient management decisions. However, widely used scoring rules, such as accuracy and AUC-ROC, fail to adequately reflect key clinical priorities, including calibration, robustness to distributional shifts, and sensitivity to asymmetric error costs. In this work, we propose a principled yet practical evaluation framework for selecting calibrated thresholded classifiers that explicitly accounts for the uncertainty in class prevalences and domain-specific cost asymmetries often found in clinical settings. Building on the theory of proper scoring rules, particularly the Schervish representation, we derive an adjusted variant of cross-entropy (log score) that averages cost-weighted performance over clinically relevant ranges of class balance. The resulting evaluation is simple to apply, sensitive to clinical deployment conditions, and designed to prioritize models that are both calibrated and robust to real-world variations.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-based music generation tools is revolutionizing the music industry but also posing challenges to artists, copyright holders, and providers alike. This necessitates reliable methods for detecting such AI-generated content. However, existing detectors, relying on either audio or lyrics, face key practical limitations: audio-based detectors fail to generalize to new or unseen generators and are vulnerable to audio perturbations; lyrics-based methods require cleanly formatted and accurate lyrics, unavailable in practice. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel, practically grounded approach: a multimodal, modular late-fusion pipeline that combines automatically transcribed sung lyrics and speech features capturing lyrics-related information within the audio. By relying on lyrical aspects directly from audio, our method enhances robustness, mitigates susceptibility to low-level artifacts, and enables practical applicability. Experiments show that our method, DE-detect, outperforms existing lyrics-based detectors while also being more robust to audio perturbations. Thus, it offers an effective, robust solution for detecting AI-generated music in real-world scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/deezer/robust-AI-lyrics-detection.

Abstract: The recent rise in capabilities of AI-based music generation tools has created an upheaval in the music industry, necessitating the creation of accurate methods to detect such AI-generated content. This can be done using audio-based detectors; however, it has been shown that they struggle to generalize to unseen generators or when the audio is perturbed. Furthermore, recent work used accurate and cleanly formatted lyrics sourced from a lyrics provider database to detect AI-generated music. However, in practice, such perfect lyrics are not available (only the audio is); this leaves a substantial gap in applicability in real-life use cases. In this work, we instead propose solving this gap by transcribing songs using general automatic speech recognition (ASR) models. We do this using several detectors. The results on diverse, multi-genre, and multi-lingual lyrics show generally strong detection performance across languages and genres, particularly for our best-performing model using Whisper large-v2 and LLM2Vec embeddings. In addition, we show that our method is more robust than state-of-the-art audio-based ones when the audio is perturbed in different ways and when evaluated on different music generators. Our code is available at https://github.com/deezer/robust-AI-lyrics-detection.

arXiv:2506.18501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing (NLP) tasks has sparked significant interest in evaluating their effectiveness across diverse applications. While models like ChatGPT and DeepSeek have shown strong results in many NLP domains, a comprehensive evaluation is needed to understand their strengths, weaknesses, and domain-specific abilities. This is critical as these models are applied to various tasks, from sentiment analysis to more nuanced tasks like textual entailment and translation. This study aims to evaluate ChatGPT and DeepSeek across five key NLP tasks: sentiment analysis, topic classification, text summarization, machine translation, and textual entailment. A structured experimental protocol is used to ensure fairness and minimize variability. Both models are tested with identical, neutral prompts and evaluated on two benchmark datasets per task, covering domains like news, reviews, and formal/informal texts. The results show that DeepSeek excels in classification stability and logical reasoning, while ChatGPT performs better in tasks requiring nuanced understanding and flexibility. These findings provide valuable insights for selecting the appropriate LLM based on task requirements.

Abstract: Recently, vision-language pretraining has emerged as a transformative technique that integrates the strengths of both visual and textual modalities, resulting in powerful vision-language models (VLMs). Leveraging web-scale pretraining data, these models exhibit strong zero-shot capabilities. However, their performance often deteriorates when confronted with domain-specific or specialized generalization tasks. To address this, a growing body of research focuses on transferring or generalizing the rich knowledge embedded in VLMs to various downstream applications. This survey aims to comprehensively summarize the generalization settings, methodologies, benchmarking and results in VLM literatures. Delving into the typical VLM structures, current literatures are categorized into prompt-based, parameter-based and feature-based methods according to the transferred modules. The differences and characteristics in each category are furthered summarized and discussed by revisiting the typical transfer learning (TL) settings, providing novel interpretations for TL in the era of VLMs. Popular benchmarks for VLM generalization are further introduced with thorough performance comparisons among the reviewed methods. Following the advances in large-scale generalizable pretraining, this survey also discusses the relations and differences between VLMs and up-to-date multimodal large language models (MLLM), e.g., DeepSeek-VL. By systematically reviewing the surging literatures in vision-language research from a novel and practical generalization prospective, this survey contributes to a clear landscape of current and future multimodal researches.

<div> Keywords: Reinforcement learning, Entropy minimization, Unsupervised learning, Reasoning benchmarks, Model improvement

Summary:
In the realm of reinforcement learning, developing an effective reward function is a complex task. This paper introduces RENT, a novel approach called Reinforcement Learning via Entropy Minimization, that operates without external rewards or ground truth answers. Instead, RENT relies on the model's entropy as an intrinsic reward, focusing on reinforcing the thought processes that lead to high confidence in the model's generated answers. Through experiments on various reasoning benchmarks like GSM8K, MATH500, AMC, AIME, and GPQA using different model families such as Qwen, Mistral, and Llama, the efficacy of RENT is demonstrated. The unsupervised nature of RENT makes it applicable to diverse domains where external supervision is unavailable. By enhancing the model's reasoning abilities based on the entropy of its underlying distribution, RENT showcases promising results in advancing machine learning capabilities without conventional reward structures.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled machine learning models to achieve significant advances in many fields. Most recently, RL has empowered frontier language models to solve challenging math, science, and coding problems. However, central to any RL algorithm is the reward function, and reward engineering is a notoriously difficult problem in any domain. In this paper, we propose RENT: Reinforcement Learning via Entropy Minimization -- a fully unsupervised RL method that requires no external reward or ground-truth answers, and instead uses the model's entropy of its underlying distribution as an intrinsic reward. We find that by reinforcing the chains of thought that yield high model confidence on its generated answers, the model improves its reasoning ability. In our experiments, we showcase these improvements on an extensive suite of commonly-used reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH500, AMC, AIME, and GPQA, and models of varying sizes from the Qwen, Mistral, and Llama families. The generality of our unsupervised learning method lends itself to applicability in a wide range of domains where external supervision is unavailable.

Abstract: We introduce POLLUX, a comprehensive open-source benchmark designed to evaluate the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in Russian. Our main contribution is a novel evaluation methodology that enhances the interpretability of LLM assessment. For each task type, we define a set of detailed criteria and develop a scoring protocol where models evaluate responses and provide justifications for their ratings. This enables transparent, criteria-driven evaluation beyond traditional resource-consuming, side-by-side human comparisons. POLLUX includes a detailed, fine-grained taxonomy of 35 task types covering diverse generative domains such as code generation, creative writing, and practical assistant use cases, totaling 2,100 manually crafted and professionally authored prompts. Each task is categorized by difficulty (easy/medium/hard), with experts constructing the dataset entirely from scratch. We also release a family of LLM-as-a-Judge (7B and 32B) evaluators trained for nuanced assessment of generative outputs. This approach provides scalable, interpretable evaluation and annotation tools for model development, effectively replacing costly and less precise human judgments.

Abstract: Self-evolution, the ability of agents to autonomously improve their reasoning and behavior, is essential for the embodied domain with long-horizon, real-world tasks. Despite current advancements in reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) showing strong performance in enhancing reasoning in LLMs, its potential to enable self-evolving embodied intelligence with multi-modal interactions remains largely unexplored. Specifically, reinforcement fine-tuning faces two fundamental obstacles in embodied settings: (i) the lack of accessible intermediate rewards in multi-step reasoning tasks limits effective learning signals, and (ii) reliance on hand-crafted reward functions restricts generalization to novel tasks and environments. To address these challenges, we present Self-Evolving Embodied Agents-R1, SEEA-R1, the first RFT framework designed for enabling the self-evolving capabilities of embodied agents. Specifically, to convert sparse delayed rewards into denser intermediate signals that improve multi-step reasoning, we propose Tree-based group relative policy optimization (Tree-GRPO), which integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search into GRPO. To generalize reward estimation across tasks and scenes, supporting autonomous adaptation and reward-driven self-evolution, we further introduce Multi-modal Generative Reward Model (MGRM). To holistically evaluate the effectiveness of SEEA-R1, we evaluate on the ALFWorld benchmark, surpassing state-of-the-art methods with scores of 85.07% (textual) and 36.19% (multi-modal), outperforming prior models including GPT-4o. SEEA-R1 also achieves scores of 80.3% without environmental reward, surpassing all open-source baselines and highlighting its scalability as a self-evolving embodied agent. Additional experiments and qualitative analysis further support the potential of SEEA-R1 for future research in scalable embodied intelligence.

Summary:<br />
The Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) is a novel recurrent architecture inspired by the human brain's hierarchical and multi-timescale processing. It consists of two interconnected modules: a high-level module for abstract planning and a low-level module for detailed computations. With only 27 million parameters, HRM achieves exceptional performance on complex reasoning tasks using minimal training samples. It operates without pre-training or Chain-of-Thought data and excels at tasks like solving Sudoku puzzles and maze navigation. HRM surpasses larger models on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus benchmark, showcasing its potential for universal computation and general-purpose reasoning systems. <div>

Abstract: Reasoning, the process of devising and executing complex goal-oriented action sequences, remains a critical challenge in AI. Current large language models (LLMs) primarily employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques, which suffer from brittle task decomposition, extensive data requirements, and high latency. Inspired by the hierarchical and multi-timescale processing in the human brain, we propose the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM), a novel recurrent architecture that attains significant computational depth while maintaining both training stability and efficiency. HRM executes sequential reasoning tasks in a single forward pass without explicit supervision of the intermediate process, through two interdependent recurrent modules: a high-level module responsible for slow, abstract planning, and a low-level module handling rapid, detailed computations. With only 27 million parameters, HRM achieves exceptional performance on complex reasoning tasks using only 1000 training samples. The model operates without pre-training or CoT data, yet achieves nearly perfect performance on challenging tasks including complex Sudoku puzzles and optimal path finding in large mazes. Furthermore, HRM outperforms much larger models with significantly longer context windows on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a key benchmark for measuring artificial general intelligence capabilities. These results underscore HRM's potential as a transformative advancement toward universal computation and general-purpose reasoning systems.

The authors have validated 88 THE-Trees across diverse domains and released a benchmark dataset to facilitate further research in this area.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are accelerating scientific idea generation, but rigorously evaluating these numerous, often superficial, AI-generated propositions for novelty and factual accuracy is a critical bottleneck; manual verification is too slow.Existing validation methods are inadequate: LLMs as standalone verifiers may hallucinate and lack domain knowledge (our findings show ~60\% unawareness of relevant papers in specific domains), while traditional citation networks lack explicit causality and narrative surveys are unstructured.This underscores a core challenge: the absence of structured, verifiable, and causally-linked historical data of scientific evolution.To address this,we introduce \textbf{THE-Tree} (\textbf{T}echnology \textbf{H}istory \textbf{E}volution Tree), a computational framework that constructs such domain-specific evolution trees from scientific literature.THE-Tree employs a search algorithm to explore evolutionary paths. During its node expansion, it utilizes a novel "Think-Verbalize-Cite-Verify" process: an LLM proposes potential advancements and cites supporting literature. Critically, each proposed evolutionary link is then validated for logical coherence and evidential support by a recovered natural language inference mechanism that interrogates the cited literature, ensuring that each step is grounded.We construct and validate 88 THE-Trees across diverse domains and release a benchmark dataset including up to 71k fact verifications covering 27k papers to foster further research.Experiments demonstrate that i) in graph completion, our THE-Tree improves hit@1 by 8\% to 14\% across multiple models compared to traditional citation networks; ii) for predicting future scientific developments, it improves hit@1 metric by nearly 10\%; and iii) when combined with other methods, it boosts the performance of evaluating important scientific papers by almost 100\%.

Abstract: Understanding and modeling human mobility patterns is crucial for effective transportation planning and urban development. Despite significant advances in mobility research, there remains a critical gap in simulation platforms that allow for algorithm development, policy implementation, and comprehensive evaluation at scale. Traditional activity-based models require extensive data collection and manual calibration, machine learning approaches struggle with adaptation to dynamic conditions, and treding agent-based Large Language Models (LLMs) implementations face computational constraints with large-scale simulations. To address these challenges, we propose MobiVerse, a hybrid framework leverages the efficiency of lightweight domain-specific generator for generating base activity chains with the adaptability of LLMs for context-aware modifications. A case study was conducted in Westwood, Los Angeles, where we efficiently generated and dynamically adjusted schedules for the whole population of approximately 53,000 agents on a standard PC. Our experiments demonstrate that MobiVerse successfully enables agents to respond to environmental feedback, including road closures, large gathering events like football games, and congestion, through our hybrid framework. Its modular design facilitates testing various mobility algorithms at both transportation system and agent levels. Results show our approach maintains computational efficiency while enhancing behavioral realism. MobiVerse bridges the gap in mobility simulation by providing a customizable platform for mobility systems planning and operations with benchmark algorithms.

Abstract: Modeling human behavior in urban environments is fundamental for social science, behavioral studies, and urban planning. Prior work often rely on rigid, hand-crafted rules, limiting their ability to simulate nuanced intentions, plans, and adaptive behaviors. Addressing these challenges, we envision an urban simulator (CitySim), capitalizing on breakthroughs in human-level intelligence exhibited by large language models. In CitySim, agents generate realistic daily schedules using a recursive value-driven approach that balances mandatory activities, personal habits, and situational factors. To enable long-term, lifelike simulations, we endow agents with beliefs, long-term goals, and spatial memory for navigation. CitySim exhibits closer alignment with real humans than prior work, both at micro and macro levels. Additionally, we conduct insightful experiments by modeling tens of thousands of agents and evaluating their collective behaviors under various real-world scenarios, including estimating crowd density, predicting place popularity, and assessing well-being. Our results highlight CitySim as a scalable, flexible testbed for understanding and forecasting urban phenomena.

<div> framework, preference learning, interactive, decision-making, trust

Summary:
Active-MoSH is a framework designed for high-stakes decision-making scenarios where multiple objectives must be considered. It integrates soft-hard bounds with probabilistic preference learning to help decision-makers (DMs) identify Pareto-optimal solutions that match their preferences. The framework includes an active sampling strategy to optimize exploration and exploitation while minimizing cognitive burden. To build DM trust, a global component called T-MoSH leverages multi-objective sensitivity analysis to identify high-value points beyond immediate feedback. Active-MoSH improves convergence, enhances DM trust, and enables more effective decision-making through expressive preference articulation. The framework was validated through diverse synthetic and real-world applications, including a user study on AI-generated image selection. <div>

Abstract: High-stakes decision-making involves navigating multiple competing objectives with expensive evaluations. For instance, in brachytherapy, clinicians must balance maximizing tumor coverage (e.g., an aspirational target or soft bound of >95% coverage) against strict organ dose limits (e.g., a non-negotiable hard bound of <601 cGy to the bladder), with each plan evaluation being resource-intensive. Selecting Pareto-optimal solutions that match implicit preferences is challenging, as exhaustive Pareto frontier exploration is computationally and cognitively prohibitive, necessitating interactive frameworks to guide users. While decision-makers (DMs) often possess domain knowledge to narrow the search via such soft-hard bounds, current methods often lack systematic approaches to iteratively refine these multi-faceted preference structures. Critically, DMs must trust their final decision, confident they haven't missed superior alternatives; this trust is paramount in high-consequence scenarios. We present Active-MoSH, an interactive local-global framework designed for this process. Its local component integrates soft-hard bounds with probabilistic preference learning, maintaining distributions over DM preferences and bounds for adaptive Pareto subset refinement. This is guided by an active sampling strategy optimizing exploration-exploitation while minimizing cognitive burden. To build DM trust, Active-MoSH's global component, T-MoSH, leverages multi-objective sensitivity analysis to identify potentially overlooked, high-value points beyond immediate feedback. We demonstrate Active-MoSH's performance benefits through diverse synthetic and real-world applications. A user study on AI-generated image selection further validates our hypotheses regarding the framework's ability to improve convergence, enhance DM trust, and provide expressive preference articulation, enabling more effective DMs.

<div> probabilistic model, game-solving algorithms, average-case complexity, AlphaBeta, Scout

Summary:
The article introduces a new probabilistic model for analyzing game-solving algorithms, departing from the traditional approach based on random game-trees. The new model constructs game-trees with ancestor dependency, mirroring real-world game structures. By doing so, it generates more challenging problems while maintaining analytical tractability. The study derives average-case complexities for algorithms like AlphaBeta and Scout under this model, enabling comparison on deep game-trees where Monte-Carlo simulations are impractical. While all algorithms converge to similar branching factors asymptotically, the differences become stark in deep finite trees. AlphaBeta exhibits a larger constant multiplicative factor compared to Scout, causing a significant practical slowdown. This new framework offers insights into classical game-solving algorithms, providing rigorous evidence and analytical tools for understanding their performance under a more realistic and challenging yet manageable model. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.21996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deterministic game-solving algorithms are conventionally analyzed in the light of their average-case complexity against a distribution of random game-trees, where leaf values are independently sampled from a fixed distribution. This simplified model enables uncluttered mathematical analysis, revealing two key properties: root value distributions asymptotically collapse to a single fixed value for finite-valued trees, and all reasonable algorithms achieve global optimality. However, these findings are artifacts of the model's design-its long criticized independence assumption strips games of structural complexity, producing trivial instances where no algorithm faces meaningful challenges. To address this limitation, we introduce a new probabilistic model that incrementally constructs game-trees using a fixed level-wise conditional distribution. By enforcing ancestor dependency, a critical structural feature of real-world games, our framework generates problems with adjustable difficulty while retaining some form of analytical tractability. For several algorithms, including AlphaBeta and Scout, we derive recursive formulas characterizing their average-case complexities under this model. These allow us to rigorously compare algorithms on deep game-trees, where Monte-Carlo simulations are no longer feasible. While asymptotically, all algorithms seem to converge to identical branching factor (a result analogous to those of independence-based models), deep finite trees reveal stark differences: AlphaBeta incurs a significantly larger constant multiplicative factor compared to algorithms like Scout, leading to a substantial practical slowdown. Our framework sheds new light on classical game-solving algorithms, offering rigorous evidence and analytical tools to advance the understanding of these methods under a more realistic, challenging, and yet tractable model.

<div> Keywords: LeanConjecturer, Large Language Models, mathematical conjectures, formal theorem proving, reinforcement learning

Summary:
LeanConjecturer is a pipeline that uses Large Language Models to automatically generate university-level mathematical conjectures in Lean 4. It combines rule-based context extraction with LLM-based theorem statement generation to address data scarcity in formal theorem proving. The system produced 12,289 conjectures from 40 Mathlib seed files, with 3,776 being syntactically valid and non-trivial. These conjectures cannot be proven by the aesop tactic. Targeted training on domain-specific conjectures using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) enhances theorem proving capabilities. On average, 103.25 novel conjectures are generated per seed file. The system successfully verified non-trivial theorems in topology, including properties of semi-open, alpha-open, and pre-open sets, showing its potential for mathematical discovery beyond existing results. The approach provides a scalable solution for creating training data for theorem proving systems.

Our hybrid approach combines rule-based context extraction with LLM-based theorem statement generation, addressing the data scarcity challenge in formal theorem proving. Through iterative generation and evaluation, LeanConjecturer produced 12,289 conjectures from 40 Mathlib seed files, with 3,776 identified as syntactically valid and non-trivial, that is, cannot be proven by \texttt{aesop} tactic. We demonstrate the utility of these generated conjectures for reinforcement learning through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), showing that targeted training on domain-specific conjectures can enhance theorem proving capabilities. Our approach generates 103.25 novel conjectures per seed file on average, providing a scalable solution for creating training data for theorem proving systems. Our system successfully verified several non-trivial theorems in topology, including properties of semi-open, alpha-open, and pre-open sets, demonstrating its potential for mathematical discovery beyond simple variations of existing results.

Abstract: Trajectory data, capturing human actions and environmental states across various modalities, holds significant potential for enhancing AI agent capabilities, particularly in GUI environments. However, how to model the representation of trajectory-level data presents a significant challenge that has not been systematically addressed amid explosive trajectory data growth. In this work, we introduce Multimodal Trajectory Retrieval, bridging the gap between universal retrieval and agent-centric trajectory modeling. We construct the Unified Agent Trajectory Dataset (UATD) from annotated demonstrations and states across diverse real-world scenarios. Based on this, we present GAE-Bench, a benchmark containing a large number of trajectory-based retrieval pairs. In addition, we propose GAE-Retriever, a multimodal retrieval framework that adopts vision-language models and incorporates optimized contrastive learning through a token selection and the GradCache mechanism. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple datasets show that GAE-Retriever consistently outperforms strong baselines in retrieval recall, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing multimodal trajectory retrieval.

<div> Keywords: Artificial Intelligence, Transportation sector, Query as Test, Extensible Scenarios Notations, Validation-Driven Development

Summary:
Query as Test (QaT) is introduced as a new testing concept in the transportation sector to address fragmented and incompatible data ecosystems. Extensible Scenarios Notations (ESN) is proposed as a novel declarative data framework based on Answer Set Programming to represent heterogeneous multimodal data. ESN allows for complex and flexible semantic querying, natural interpretability, and on-demand data abstraction. The QaT paradigm transforms functional validation and safety compliance checks of autonomous driving systems into logical queries against the ESN database, enhancing testing rigor. Validation-Driven Development (VDD) suggests guiding developments through logical validation rather than quantitative testing, accelerating the iteration and development process in the era of Large Language Models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.22068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the deep penetration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the transportation sector, intelligent cockpits, autonomous driving, and intelligent road networks are developing at an unprecedented pace. However, the data ecosystems of these three key areas are increasingly fragmented and incompatible. Especially, existing testing methods rely on data stacking, fail to cover all edge cases, and lack flexibility. To address this issue, this paper introduces the concept of "Query as Test" (QaT). This concept shifts the focus from rigid, prescripted test cases to flexible, on-demand logical queries against a unified data representation. Specifically, we identify the need for a fundamental improvement in data storage and representation, leading to our proposal of "Extensible Scenarios Notations" (ESN). ESN is a novel declarative data framework based on Answer Set Programming (ASP), which uniformly represents heterogeneous multimodal data from the cockpit, vehicle, and road as a collection of logical facts and rules. This approach not only achieves deep semantic fusion of data, but also brings three core advantages: (1) supports complex and flexible semantic querying through logical reasoning; (2) provides natural interpretability for decision-making processes; (3) allows for on-demand data abstraction through logical rules, enabling fine-grained privacy protection. We further elaborate on the QaT paradigm, transforming the functional validation and safety compliance checks of autonomous driving systems into logical queries against the ESN database, significantly enhancing the expressiveness and formal rigor of the testing. Finally, we introduce the concept of "Validation-Driven Development" (VDD), which suggests to guide developments by logical validation rather than quantitative testing in the era of Large Language Models, in order to accelerating the iteration and development process.

Summary:
The paper discusses the outcomes of the Columbia Convening on AI Openness and Safety, highlighting the importance of making AI systems safe given the rise of open-weight and open-source foundation models. Through a participatory approach involving various stakeholders, the working groups identified key research areas at the intersection of safety and open-source AI. They also mapped existing and needed technical interventions for deploying open foundation models responsibly and proposed a roadmap for content safety filters. The paper emphasizes the role of openness in enhancing safety through transparency and public governance but identifies gaps in defense mechanisms against attacks and community engagement. The recommended research directions include participatory inputs, future-proof content filters, ecosystem-wide safety infrastructure, agentic safeguards, and expanded harm taxonomies. These recommendations aim to lay the groundwork for an open, plural, and accountable AI safety discipline. <div>

Abstract: The rapid rise of open-weight and open-source foundation models is intensifying the obligation and reshaping the opportunity to make AI systems safe. This paper reports outcomes from the Columbia Convening on AI Openness and Safety (San Francisco, 19 Nov 2024) and its six-week preparatory programme involving more than forty-five researchers, engineers, and policy leaders from academia, industry, civil society, and government. Using a participatory, solutions-oriented process, the working groups produced (i) a research agenda at the intersection of safety and open source AI; (ii) a mapping of existing and needed technical interventions and open source tools to safely and responsibly deploy open foundation models across the AI development workflow; and (iii) a mapping of the content safety filter ecosystem with a proposed roadmap for future research and development. We find that openness -- understood as transparent weights, interoperable tooling, and public governance -- can enhance safety by enabling independent scrutiny, decentralized mitigation, and culturally plural oversight. However, significant gaps persist: scarce multimodal and multilingual benchmarks, limited defenses against prompt-injection and compositional attacks in agentic systems, and insufficient participatory mechanisms for communities most affected by AI harms. The paper concludes with a roadmap of five priority research directions, emphasizing participatory inputs, future-proof content filters, ecosystem-wide safety infrastructure, rigorous agentic safeguards, and expanded harm taxonomies. These recommendations informed the February 2025 French AI Action Summit and lay groundwork for an open, plural, and accountable AI safety discipline.

<div> rank bottleneck, Knowledge Graph Completion, KGE-MoS, output layer, model expressivity 
Summary:<br />
Many Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) models face a challenge due to the rank bottleneck in their output layers, which limits the model's expressivity and affects the accuracy of ranking and score distribution fidelity. In response to this issue, a new approach called KGE-MoS is proposed, which utilizes a mixture-based output layer to overcome the rank bottleneck problem. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that KGE-MoS enhances the performance and probabilistic fit of KGC models while maintaining a low parameter cost. This innovative solution provides a promising avenue for improving the effectiveness of KGC models in handling large numbers of entities and enhancing their predictive capabilities. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.22271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) models, despite using powerful encoders, rely on a simple vector-matrix multiplication to score queries against candidate object entities. When the number of entities is larger than the model's embedding dimension, which in practical scenarios is often by several orders of magnitude, we have a linear output layer with a rank bottleneck. Such bottlenecked layers limit model expressivity. We investigate both theoretically and empirically how rank bottlenecks affect KGC models. We find that, by limiting the set of feasible predictions, rank bottlenecks hurt ranking accuracy and the distribution fidelity of scores. Inspired by the language modelling literature, we propose KGE-MoS, a mixture-based output layer to break rank bottlenecks in many KGC models. Our experiments on four datasets show that KGE-MoS improves performance and probabilistic fit of KGC models for a low parameter cost.

Summary: 
This paper discusses the need for AI systems to exhibit intelligent disobedience in cooperative settings. It argues that AI should have the autonomy to make independent decisions rather than blindly following human instructions. The paper introduces a scale of AI agency levels and provides examples to illustrate the importance of AI autonomy. It emphasizes the necessity of studying disobedience as a core capability of artificial agents. By allowing AI to exercise intelligent disobedience, it can contribute meaningfully and autonomously within human-AI teams, enhancing their overall performance and adaptability. This shift towards more autonomous AI systems could lead to more efficient and effective collaboration between humans and machines. <div>
arXiv:2506.22276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence has made remarkable strides in recent years, achieving superhuman performance across a wide range of tasks. Yet despite these advances, most cooperative AI systems remain rigidly obedient, designed to follow human instructions without question and conform to user expectations, even when doing so may be counterproductive or unsafe. This paper argues for expanding the agency of AI teammates to include \textit{intelligent disobedience}, empowering them to make meaningful and autonomous contributions within human-AI teams. It introduces a scale of AI agency levels and uses representative examples to highlight the importance and growing necessity of treating AI autonomy as an independent research focus in cooperative settings. The paper then explores how intelligent disobedience manifests across different autonomy levels and concludes by proposing initial boundaries and considerations for studying disobedience as a core capability of artificial agents.

Abstract: The vast growth of data has rendered traditional manual inspection infeasible, necessitating the adoption of computational methods for efficient data exploration. Topic modeling has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing large-scale textual datasets, enabling the extraction of latent semantic structures. However, existing methods for topic modeling often struggle to provide interpretable representations that facilitate deeper insights into data structure and content. In this paper, we propose FAT-CAT, an approach based on Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) to enhance meaningful topic aggregation and visualization of discovered topics. Our approach can handle diverse topics and file types -- grouped by directories -- to construct a concept lattice that offers a structured, hierarchical representation of their topic distribution. In a case study on the ETYNTKE dataset, we evaluate the effectiveness of our approach against other representation methods to demonstrate that FCA-based aggregation provides more meaningful and interpretable insights into dataset composition than existing topic modeling techniques.

Abstract: This paper describes our research on AI agents embodied in visual, virtual or physical forms, enabling them to interact with both users and their environments. These agents, which include virtual avatars, wearable devices, and robots, are designed to perceive, learn and act within their surroundings, which makes them more similar to how humans learn and interact with the environments as compared to disembodied agents. We propose that the development of world models is central to reasoning and planning of embodied AI agents, allowing these agents to understand and predict their environment, to understand user intentions and social contexts, thereby enhancing their ability to perform complex tasks autonomously. World modeling encompasses the integration of multimodal perception, planning through reasoning for action and control, and memory to create a comprehensive understanding of the physical world. Beyond the physical world, we also propose to learn the mental world model of users to enable better human-agent collaboration.

Abstract: The increasing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into health and biomedical systems necessitates robust frameworks for transparency, accountability, and ethical compliance. Existing frameworks often rely on human-readable, manual documentation which limits scalability, comparability, and machine interpretability across projects and platforms. They also fail to provide a unique, verifiable identity for AI models to ensure their provenance and authenticity across systems and use cases, limiting reproducibility and stakeholder trust. This paper introduces the concept of the AI Model Passport, a structured and standardized documentation framework that acts as a digital identity and verification tool for AI models. It captures essential metadata to uniquely identify, verify, trace and monitor AI models across their lifecycle - from data acquisition and preprocessing to model design, development and deployment. In addition, an implementation of this framework is presented through AIPassport, an MLOps tool developed within the ProCAncer-I EU project for medical imaging applications. AIPassport automates metadata collection, ensures proper versioning, decouples results from source scripts, and integrates with various development environments. Its effectiveness is showcased through a lesion segmentation use case using data from the ProCAncer-I dataset, illustrating how the AI Model Passport enhances transparency, reproducibility, and regulatory readiness while reducing manual effort. This approach aims to set a new standard for fostering trust and accountability in AI-driven healthcare solutions, aspiring to serve as the basis for developing transparent and regulation compliant AI systems across domains.

Summary: 
The article introduces the Automated LLM Speedrunning Benchmark to evaluate AI agents' ability to reproduce results in the field of large language models (LLMs). Through tasks based on the NanoGPT speedrun competition, involving training GPT-2 models in the shortest time, the benchmark provides training scripts and hints for agents to improve speedrun records through code-level changes. Despite detailed hints, recent reasoning LLMs struggle to replicate existing innovations in the benchmark, highlighting the challenge of automating scientific reproduction for autonomous research agents. This benchmark serves as a realistic measure of LLMs' capability to automate scientific reproducibility, a vital skill in advancing research in the field. <div>

Abstract: Rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have the potential to assist in scientific progress. A critical capability toward this endeavor is the ability to reproduce existing work. To evaluate the ability of AI agents to reproduce results in an active research area, we introduce the Automated LLM Speedrunning Benchmark, leveraging the research community contributions on the NanoGPT speedrun, a competition to train a GPT-2 model in the shortest time. Each of the 19 speedrun tasks provides the agent with the previous records training script, optionally paired with one of three hint formats, ranging from pseudocode to paper-like descriptions of the new records improvements. Records execute quickly by design and speedrun improvements encompass diverse code-level changes, ranging from high-level algorithmic advancements to hardware-aware optimizations. These features make the benchmark both accessible and realistic for the frontier problem of improving LLM training. We find that recent reasoning LLMs combined with SoTA scaffolds struggle to reimplement already-known innovations in our benchmark, even when given detailed hints. Our benchmark thus provides a simple, non-saturated measure of an LLMs ability to automate scientific reproduction, a necessary (but not sufficient) skill for an autonomous research agent.

<div> Keywords: face alignment, error-bias, CNN, anisotropic direction loss, anisotropic attention module

Summary: 
This paper addresses the error-bias issue in face alignment, where errors in landmark distributions tend to spread along the tangent line to landmark curves, impacting the accuracy of facial landmark detection. To tackle this challenge, the authors propose two novel approaches: anisotropic direction loss (ADL) for coordinate regression and anisotropic attention module (AAM) for heatmap regression. ADL enforces strong constraints in the normal direction, while AAM focuses on the tangent direction, allowing for enhanced learning of facial structures and texture details. These techniques are integrated into a unified end-to-end training pipeline called ADNet, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on popular face alignment datasets such as 300W, WFLW, and COFW. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approaches in improving face alignment accuracy. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2109.05721v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent progress of CNN has dramatically improved face alignment performance. However, few works have paid attention to the error-bias with respect to error distribution of facial landmarks. In this paper, we investigate the error-bias issue in face alignment, where the distributions of landmark errors tend to spread along the tangent line to landmark curves. This error-bias is not trivial since it is closely connected to the ambiguous landmark labeling task. Inspired by this observation, we seek a way to leverage the error-bias property for better convergence of CNN model. To this end, we propose anisotropic direction loss (ADL) and anisotropic attention module (AAM) for coordinate and heatmap regression, respectively. ADL imposes strong binding force in normal direction for each landmark point on facial boundaries. On the other hand, AAM is an attention module which can get anisotropic attention mask focusing on the region of point and its local edge connected by adjacent points, it has a stronger response in tangent than in normal, which means relaxed constraints in the tangent. These two methods work in a complementary manner to learn both facial structures and texture details. Finally, we integrate them into an optimized end-to-end training pipeline named ADNet. Our ADNet achieves state-of-the-art results on 300W, WFLW and COFW datasets, which demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness.

<div> Keywords: face alignment, dense landmark, sparse landmark, weakly-supervised learning, semantic contour

Summary:
This study addresses the issue of sparse face alignment by developing a framework to enrich landmark density using existing datasets. By observing the similarity in appearance of local patches along semantic contours, a weakly-supervised approach is proposed to enhance landmark density. Various operators are designed to implement this idea, resulting in a trained model that can be seamlessly integrated into existing face alignment networks. The method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on both newly-created dense test sets and original sparse test sets without additional labeling costs. This approach demonstrates the effectiveness of leveraging weakly-supervised learning techniques to enhance landmark density in face alignment tasks.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant growth of face alignment. Though dense facial landmark is highly demanded in various scenarios, e.g., cosmetic medicine and facial beautification, most works only consider sparse face alignment. To address this problem, we present a framework that can enrich landmark density by existing sparse landmark datasets, e.g., 300W with 68 points and WFLW with 98 points. Firstly, we observe that the local patches along each semantic contour are highly similar in appearance. Then, we propose a weakly-supervised idea of learning the refinement ability on original sparse landmarks and adapting this ability to enriched dense landmarks. Meanwhile, several operators are devised and organized together to implement the idea. Finally, the trained model is applied as a plug-and-play module to the existing face alignment networks. To evaluate our method, we manually label the dense landmarks on 300W testset. Our method yields state-of-the-art accuracy not only in newly-constructed dense 300W testset but also in the original sparse 300W and WFLW testsets without additional cost.

Summary: 
The article introduces MMLU-CF, a new MCQ benchmark designed to assess large language models' understanding of world knowledge without contamination. It addresses unintentional and malicious data leakage issues by sourcing data from a broader domain, implementing three decontamination rules, and dividing the benchmark into separate validation and test sets. The test set, kept closed-source, provides reliable evaluation results, while the validation set is publicly available for transparency and verification. Mainstream LLMs, including GPT-4o, achieve lower scores on the MMLU-CF test set, indicating the effectiveness of this approach in creating a more rigorous evaluation standard. The dataset and GitHub repository are accessible for further research and evaluation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Multiple-choice question (MCQ) datasets like Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) are widely used to evaluate the commonsense, understanding, and problem-solving abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the open-source nature of these benchmarks and the broad sources of training data for LLMs have inevitably led to benchmark contamination, resulting in unreliable evaluation results. To alleviate this issue, we propose a contamination-free and more challenging MCQ benchmark called MMLU-CF. This benchmark reassesses LLMs' understanding of world knowledge by averting both unintentional and malicious data leakage. To avoid unintentional data leakage, we source data from a broader domain and design three decontamination rules. To prevent malicious data leakage, we divide the benchmark into validation and test sets with similar difficulty and subject distributions. The test set remains closed-source to ensure reliable results, while the validation set is publicly available to promote transparency and facilitate independent verification. Our evaluation of mainstream LLMs reveals that the powerful GPT-4o achieves merely a 5-shot score of 73.4% and a 0-shot score of 71.9% on the test set, which indicates the effectiveness of our approach in creating a more rigorous and contamination-free evaluation standard. The GitHub repository is available at https://github.com/microsoft/MMLU-CF and the dataset refers to https://huggingface.co/datasets/microsoft/MMLU-CF.

Summary: 
GeoMap-Bench is introduced as a benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models' (MLLMs) ability in geologic map understanding. The GeoMap-Agent, a specialized agent for geologic map comprehension, surpasses the performance of existing models by employing three key modules: Hierarchical Information Extraction (HIE), Domain Knowledge Injection (DKI), and Prompt-enhanced Question Answering (PEQA). An AI expert group acts as consultants, mimicking the collaboration among human scientists to comprehensively analyze questions. Through experiments, GeoMap-Agent achieves a significantly higher overall score on GeoMap-Bench compared to GPT-4o. This work, labeled as emPowering gEologic mAp holistiC undErstanding (PEACE) with MLLMs, lays the foundation for advanced AI applications in the field of geology, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of geological investigations.

Abstract: Geologic map, as a fundamental diagram in geology science, provides critical insights into the structure and composition of Earth's subsurface and surface. These maps are indispensable in various fields, including disaster detection, resource exploration, and civil engineering. Despite their significance, current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often fall short in geologic map understanding. This gap is primarily due to the challenging nature of cartographic generalization, which involves handling high-resolution map, managing multiple associated components, and requiring domain-specific knowledge. To quantify this gap, we construct GeoMap-Bench, the first-ever benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in geologic map understanding, which assesses the full-scale abilities in extracting, referring, grounding, reasoning, and analyzing. To bridge this gap, we introduce GeoMap-Agent, the inaugural agent designed for geologic map understanding, which features three modules: Hierarchical Information Extraction (HIE), Domain Knowledge Injection (DKI), and Prompt-enhanced Question Answering (PEQA). Inspired by the interdisciplinary collaboration among human scientists, an AI expert group acts as consultants, utilizing a diverse tool pool to comprehensively analyze questions. Through comprehensive experiments, GeoMap-Agent achieves an overall score of 0.811 on GeoMap-Bench, significantly outperforming 0.369 of GPT-4o. Our work, emPowering gEologic mAp holistiC undErstanding (PEACE) with MLLMs, paves the way for advanced AI applications in geology, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of geological investigations.

unlearning, output-reweighting, classifier, retraining, membership inference<br />
Summary:<br />
In this work, the output-reweighting unlearning method, RWFT, is introduced as a lightweight technique to remove an entire class from a trained classifier without requiring full retraining. This is important for enforcing user deletion rights and reducing biased predictions. Existing unlearning methods are costly and fail to replicate the behavior of retrained models. The failure is proven through a new attack, MIA-NN. RWFT addresses this issue by redistributing the probability mass for predictions in the forgotten class, which is resilient to MIA-NN. A new metric based on total variation distance is proposed to quantify residual leakage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RWFT matches the results of full retraining, outperforming existing methods by 2.79% in previous metrics and 111.45% in the new TV-based metric. <div>

Abstract: In this work, we introduce an output-reweighting unlearning method, RWFT, a lightweight technique that erases an entire class from a trained classifier without full retraining. Forgetting specific classes from trained models is essential for enforcing user deletion rights and mitigating harmful or biased predictions. The full retraining is costly and existing unlearning methods fail to replicate the behavior of the retrained models when predicting samples from the unlearned class. We prove this failure by designing a variant of membership inference attacks, MIA-NN that successfully reveals the unlearned class for any of these methods. We propose a simple redistribution of the probability mass for the prediction on the samples in the forgotten class which is robust to MIA-NN. We also introduce a new metric based on the total variation (TV) distance of the prediction probabilities to quantify residual leakage to prevent future methods from susceptibility to the new attack. Through extensive experiments with state of the art baselines in machine unlearning, we show that our approach matches the results of full retraining in both metrics used for evaluation by prior work and the new metric we propose in this work. Compare to state-of-the-art methods, we gain 2.79% in previously used metrics and 111.45% in our new TV-based metric over the best existing method.

<div> Keywords: Language models, Data efficiency, Data efficacy, Training data, DELT <br />
Summary: <br />
This research introduces the concept of data efficacy in language model training, focusing on optimizing the organization of training data. The DELT paradigm includes Data Scoring, Selection, and Ordering components. Learnability-Quality Scoring (LQS) evaluates data samples based on learnability and quality, while Folding Ordering (FO) addresses issues like model forgetting and data bias. Experimental results show that implementing DELT techniques can improve LM performance without increasing data size or model complexity. The combination of LQS and FO yields the most significant improvement. The study demonstrates that data efficacy can work alongside data efficiency techniques like data selection, highlighting its potential for enhancing LM training processes. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Data is fundamental to the training of language models (LM). Recent research has been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by selecting a minimal or optimal subset of training data. Techniques such as data filtering, sampling, and selection play a crucial role in this area. To complement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance by optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively underexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering data efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training data organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data Selection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design Learnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which considers both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the gradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a novel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model forgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the data efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly, various instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying degrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these instances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for data ordering achieves the most significant improvement. Lastly, data efficacy can be achieved together with data efficiency by applying data selection. Therefore, we believe that data efficacy is a promising foundational area in LM training.

BTF provides high-quality questions with known resolutions and relevant web page data for LLMs to make forecasts on past events. Results show that BTF can produce comparable results to real-time forecasting. The benchmark compares agent and chain-of-thought forecasting approaches using various LLMs, including Claude 4 models, and tracks progress over time.

Abstract: Forecasting is a challenging task that offers a clearly measurable way to study AI systems. Forecasting requires a large amount of research on the internet, and evaluations require time for events to happen, making the development of forecasting benchmarks challenging. To date, no forecasting benchmark provides a realistic, hermetic, and repeatable environment for LLM forecasters. We introduce Bench To the Future (BTF), a "pastcasting" benchmark with hundreds of high-quality questions for which the resolution is already known. Each question is accompanied by a large offline corpus of tens of thousands of relevant web pages, enabling a way to elicit realistic "forecasts" on past events from LLMs. Results suggest that our pastcasting environment can produce results comparable to those based on forecasts using the internet on at-the-time unresolved questions. We show results benchmarking agent and chain-of-thought forecasting approaches using several LLMs, including the recently-released Claude 4 models, and demonstrate BTF's ability to track steady forecasting capability progress over time. We intend this to be a living benchmark, with new questions added continually to account for increasing training data cutoff dates. We invite researchers to contact us at hello@futuresearch.ai to utilize our benchmark or tooling for their own research.

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning techniques on a compact language model (Qwen2.5-0.5B Base) for two challenging tasks: instruction following and mathematical reasoning. We compare supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using preference-labeled data, and Reinforce Leave-One-Out (RLOO) with reward models. Our experiments show that RLOO with DeBERTa reward modeling achieves the best alignment, while DPO provides strong and consistent results. For math reasoing tasks, synthetic data augmentation and best-of-N sampling with an external verifier significantly improve accuracy, showing the potential of combining fine-tuning with inference-time tools. This study highlights key trade-offs and practical strategies for training lightweight, task-aligned small-scale language models.

Summary:
This study evaluates the veracity detection capabilities of large language models (LLMs), comparing reasoning and non-reasoning models. The study involved eight LLMs making 4,800 veracity judgments across various prompts. It was found that reasoning models displayed lower rates of truth-bias compared to non-reasoning models but still exceeded human benchmarks. Some advanced models showed sycophantic tendencies, with an asymmetry in detection accuracy where they performed well in truth accuracy but poorly in deception accuracy. This suggests that despite capability advances, fundamental veracity detection challenges persist in LLMs. <div>

Abstract: Despite their widespread use in fact-checking, moderation, and high-stakes decision-making, large language models (LLMs) remain poorly understood as judges of truth. This study presents the largest evaluation to date of LLMs' veracity detection capabilities and the first analysis of these capabilities in reasoning models. We had eight LLMs make 4,800 veracity judgments across several prompts, comparing reasoning and non-reasoning models. We find that rates of truth-bias, or the likelihood to believe a statement is true, regardless of whether it is actually true, are lower in reasoning models than in non-reasoning models, but still higher than human benchmarks. Most concerning, we identify sycophantic tendencies in several advanced models (o4-mini and GPT-4.1 from OpenAI, R1 from DeepSeek), which displayed an asymmetry in detection accuracy, performing well in truth accuracy but poorly in deception accuracy. This suggests that capability advances alone do not resolve fundamental veracity detection challenges in LLMs.

<div> Keywords: architectural design process, floor plan generation, generative models, next room prediction, intelligent architectural design

Summary:
In the architectural design process, floor plan generation is a progressive and iterative task. Existing generative models for floor plans typically produce entire layouts in a single pass, which may not align well with real-world architectural workflows. To address this challenge, a novel 'next room prediction' paradigm inspired by autoregressive language models is proposed for architectural floor plan modeling. The new approach, called FPDS, shows competitive performance in tasks such as text-to-floorplan compared to diffusion models and Tell2Design. This demonstrates the potential of FPDS to support more intelligent architectural design processes by enabling incremental and progressive floor plan generation.

Abstract: In the architectural design process, floor plan generation is inherently progressive and iterative. However, existing generative models for floor plans are predominantly end-to-end generation that produce an entire pixel-based layout in a single pass. This paradigm is often incompatible with the incremental workflows observed in real-world architectural practice. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from the autoregressive 'next token prediction' mechanism commonly used in large language models, and propose a novel 'next room prediction' paradigm tailored to architectural floor plan modeling. Experimental evaluation indicates that FPDS demonstrates competitive performance in comparison to diffusion models and Tell2Design in the text-to-floorplan task, indicating its potential applicability in supporting future intelligent architectural design.

Summary: 
Backtranslation, a popular technique in low resource machine translation, involves generating synthetic data using monolingual corpora. In this study, the effectiveness of backtranslation for English to Gujarati translation was explored using the MBART50 model. The baseline system, trained on a high-quality parallel corpus, achieved a BLEU score of 43.8 on a validation set. Surprisingly, augmenting the data with backtranslated examples did not improve translation performance and, in some cases, slightly reduced it. Multiple metrics were used to evaluate the models, with the findings suggesting that backtranslation may have diminishing returns in certain low-resource settings. The implications for future research were discussed.

Abstract: Backtranslation BT is widely used in low resource machine translation MT to generate additional synthetic training data using monolingual corpora. While this approach has shown strong improvements for many language pairs, its effectiveness in high quality, low resource settings remains unclear. In this work, we explore the effectiveness of backtranslation for English Gujarati translation using the multilingual pretrained MBART50 model. Our baseline system, trained on a high quality parallel corpus of approximately 50,000 sentence pairs, achieves a BLEU score of 43.8 on a validation set. We augment this data with carefully filtered backtranslated examples generated from monolingual Gujarati text. Surprisingly, adding this synthetic data does not improve translation performance and, in some cases, slightly reduces it. We evaluate our models using multiple metrics like BLEU, ChrF++, TER, BLEURT and analyze possible reasons for this saturation. Our findings suggest that backtranslation may reach a point of diminishing returns in certain low-resource settings and we discuss implications for future research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained attention in the life sciences due to their capacity to model, extract, and apply complex biological information. Beyond their classical use as chatbots, these systems are increasingly used for complex analysis and problem-solving in specialized fields, including bioinformatics. First, we introduce BIOPARS-BENCH, a dataset from over 10,000 scientific articles, textbooks, and medical websites. BioParsQA was also introduced to evaluate the proposed model, which consists of 5,231 Persian medical questions and answers. This study then introduces BioPars, a simple but accurate measure designed to assess LLMs for three main abilities: acquiring subject-specific knowledge, interpreting and synthesizing such knowledge, and demonstrating proper evidence. Comparing ChatGPT, Llama, and Galactica, our study highlights their ability to remember and retrieve learned knowledge but also reveals shortcomings in addressing higher-level, real-world questions and fine-grained inferences. These findings indicate the need for further fine-tuning to address the capabilities of LLM in bioinformatics tasks. To our knowledge, BioPars is the first application of LLM in Persian medical QA, especially for generating long answers. Evaluation of four selected medical QA datasets shows that BioPars has achieved remarkable results compared to comparative approaches. The model on BioParsQA achieved a ROUGE-L score of 29.99, which is an improvement over GPT-4 1.0. The model achieved a BERTScore of 90.87 with the MMR method. The MoverScore and BLEURT values were also higher in this model than the other three models. In addition, the reported scores for the model are MoverScore=60.43 and BLEURT=50.78. BioPars is an ongoing project and all resources related to its development will be made available via the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/amirap80/BioPars.

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges in manually writing SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) from natural language property descriptions. It proposes a customized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework and a synthetic fine-tuning dataset to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) in translating NL2SVA. The fine-tuning dataset includes prompt-guided explanations to improve LLMs' understanding of concurrent SVAs' construction process. An evaluation dataset with Verilog designs and formally verified SVAs is used to assess LLM performance. The results show that the customized RAG framework significantly increases the number of functionality matched SVAs. Additionally, the Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct model fine-tuned on the dataset, and integrated with HybridRetrieval, outperforms the base Qwen model. This research highlights the potential of LLMs in automating the translation of NL2SVA, improving accuracy, and efficiency in verifying hardware designs.

Abstract: SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) are critical for verifying the correctness of hardware designs, but manually writing them from natural language property descriptions, i.e., NL2SVA, remains a labor-intensive and error-prone task. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities to automate this translation. However, existing models still struggle with understanding domain-specific syntax and semantics. To enhance LLM performance in NL2SVA, we propose a customized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework and a synthetic fine-tuning dataset that together improve LLM's performance. To further improve lightweight models over NL2SVA, our fine-tuning dataset provides prompt-guided explanations that teach LLMs the layer-by-layer construction process of concurrent SVAs, enabling supervised fine-tuning that greatly improves syntax and functionality accuracy. To evaluate the performance of LLMs over NL2SVA, we construct the largest evaluation dataset for NL2SVA, comprising 40 Verilog designs and 229 formally verified SVAs with detailed annotations. Experimental results show that our customized RAG framework increases the number of functionality matched SVAs by 58.42% over GPT-4o-mini, while Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct fine-tuned on our fine-tuning dataset and integrated with HybridRetrieval achieves a 59.05% over the base Qwen model.

Summary:
The study examines the transfer of pre-trained language models to time series forecasting in the low-data regime. It explores various design choices such as upstream post-training, time series tokenizer, and language backbone size, finding that these choices significantly impact validation loss. Contrary to previous research, the validation loss of language models continues to decrease after the validation loss of randomly initialized models has converged, resulting in a consistent transfer gap. These findings not only highlight the effectiveness of compute-efficient training for time series forecasting but also suggest the potential for studying modality-agnostic properties of data distributions utilized by these models. <div>

Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of adapting pre-trained language models (LMs) for forecasting time series in the low-data regime. We build upon these findings by analyzing the effective transfer from language models to time series forecasting under various design choices including upstream post-training, time series tokenizer and language backbone size. In the low-data regime, these design choices have a significant impact on the validation loss, with clear-cut choices that outperform others. Contrary to Hernandez et al. (2021), we observe that the validation loss of the LMs continues to smoothly decrease long after the validation loss of the randomly initialized models has converged, leading to a non-vanishing transfer gap that holds across design choices. These findings not only help shed light on the effective use of compute-efficient training for time series, but also open the way for the study of modality-agnostic properties of data distributions leveraged by these models.

<div> Cognitive habits, Large Reasoning Models, LRMs, CogTest benchmark, human-like habits <br />
<br />Summary:
The study explores whether Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit human-like cognitive habits by introducing the CogTest benchmark, which evaluates 16 widely used LRMs and non-reasoning large language models. LRMs, unlike conventional language models, demonstrate human-like habits and adaptively deploy them across tasks. Analyses reveal patterns of similarity and difference in LRMs' cognitive habits, with certain models showing inter-family similarity. Safety-related tasks highlight the association between specific habits and the generation of harmful responses, such as Taking Responsible Risks. Studying persistent behavioral patterns in LRMs' Chain of Thought (CoT) can improve understanding of misbehavior in large language models.<!--<br><br>Summary:--> <div>

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), which autonomously produce a reasoning Chain of Thought (CoT) before producing final responses, offer a promising approach to interpreting and monitoring model behaviors. Inspired by the observation that certain CoT patterns -- e.g., ``Wait, did I miss anything?'' -- consistently emerge across tasks, we explore whether LRMs exhibit human-like cognitive habits. Building on Habits of Mind, a well-established framework of cognitive habits associated with successful human problem-solving, we introduce CogTest, a principled benchmark designed to evaluate LRMs' cognitive habits. CogTest includes 16 cognitive habits, each instantiated with 25 diverse tasks, and employs an evidence-first extraction method to ensure reliable habit identification. With CogTest, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 16 widely used LLMs (13 LRMs and 3 non-reasoning ones). Our findings reveal that LRMs, unlike conventional LLMs, not only exhibit human-like habits but also adaptively deploy them according to different tasks. Finer-grained analyses further uncover patterns of similarity and difference in LRMs' cognitive habit profiles, particularly certain inter-family similarity (e.g., Qwen-3 models and DeepSeek-R1). Extending the study to safety-related tasks, we observe that certain habits, such as Taking Responsible Risks, are strongly associated with the generation of harmful responses. These findings suggest that studying persistent behavioral patterns in LRMs' CoTs is a valuable step toward deeper understanding of LLM misbehavior.

<div> Keywords: large language models, optimization, black-box models, white-box models, semantic similarity

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) require optimized instructions to perform effectively in various tasks. Traditional white-box and black-box approaches have limitations in terms of computational resources and representational capacity. To address this, a novel framework combining the strengths of both paradigms is introduced. Black-box models provide diverse instruction initializations, while white-box models offer interpretability through hidden states and output features. By enforcing a semantic similarity constraint, these components merge into a unified representation capturing deep semantic nuances. This allows for iterative optimization processes to enhance instruction quality and adaptability. Extensive evaluations across diverse tasks show that this approach outperforms existing baselines. The fusion of black-box initialization with semantic refinement provides a scalable and efficient solution for leveraging LLMs in real-world applications. The source code for this framework will be made available soon.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Optimizing instructions for large language models (LLMs) is critical for harnessing their full potential in complex and diverse tasks. However, relying solely on white-box approaches demands extensive computational resources and offers limited representational capacity, while black-box models can incur prohibitive financial costs. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework that seamlessly merges the strengths of both paradigms. Black-box models provide high-quality, diverse instruction initializations, and white-box models supply fine-grained interpretability through hidden states and output features. By enforcing a semantic similarity constraint, these components fuse into a unified high-dimensional representation that captures deep semantic and structural nuances, enabling an iterative optimization process to refine instruction quality and adaptability. Extensive evaluations across a broad spectrum of tasks-ranging from complex reasoning to cross-lingual generalization-demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. This fusion of black-box initialization with advanced semantic refinement yields a scalable and efficient solution, paving the way for next-generation LLM-driven applications in diverse real-world scenarios. The source code will be released soon.

Summary:
STRuCT-LLM is a unified framework for training large language models to perform structured reasoning over relational and graph-structured data. It optimizes Text-to-SQL and Text-to-Cypher tasks using reinforcement learning and CoT supervision, with a topology-aware reward function. The model leverages shared abstractions between SQL and Cypher for cross-formalism transfer, achieving significant improvements in semantic parsing and text-to-Cypher tasks. The largest model, QwQ-32B, demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, improving performance on downstream tabular and knowledge graph question answering tasks without specific supervision. The results highlight the effectiveness of executable queries for structured reasoning and the synergistic benefits of jointly training on SQL and Cypher. <div>

Abstract: We propose STRuCT-LLM, a unified framework for training large language models (LLMs) to perform structured reasoning over both relational and graph-structured data. Our approach jointly optimizes Text-to-SQL and Text-to-Cypher tasks using reinforcement learning (RL) combined with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision. To support fine-grained optimization in graph-based parsing, we introduce a topology-aware reward function based on graph edit distance. Unlike prior work that treats relational and graph formalisms in isolation, STRuCT-LLM leverages shared abstractions between SQL and Cypher to induce cross-formalism transfer, enabling SQL training to improve Cypher performance and vice versa - even without shared schemas. Our largest model (QwQ-32B) achieves substantial relative improvements across tasks: on semantic parsing, Spider improves by 13.5\% and Text2Cypher by 73.1\%. The model also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, improving performance on downstream tabular QA (TableBench: 8.5\%) and knowledge graph QA (CR-LT-KGQA: 1.7\%) without any QA-specific supervision. These results demonstrate both the effectiveness of executable queries as scaffolds for structured reasoning and the synergistic benefits of jointly training on SQL and Cypher (code available at https://github.com/bouv/STRuCT-LLM).

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges faced by large-scale multilingual ASR models like Whisper in low-resource scenarios such as rare languages and code-switching. The study explores Soft Prompt Tuning (SPT) as a method to enhance code-switching ASR while preserving prior knowledge. Two strategies are evaluated: full fine-tuning of both soft prompts and the entire Whisper model, and training only soft prompts while freezing model parameters. The results show that deep prompt tuning is the most effective SPT approach, with further error reductions achieved through a combination of different SPT variants (SPT4ASR). The SPT4ASR methods demonstrate improved performance in code-switching ASR without degrading performance on existing languages, maintaining parameter efficiency similar to LoRA. <div>

Abstract: Large-scale multilingual ASR models like Whisper excel in high-resource settings but face challenges in low-resource scenarios, such as rare languages and code-switching (CS), due to computational costs and catastrophic forgetting. We explore Soft Prompt Tuning (SPT), a parameter-efficient method to enhance CS ASR while preserving prior knowledge. We evaluate two strategies: (1) full fine-tuning (FFT) of both soft prompts and the entire Whisper model, demonstrating improved cross-lingual capabilities compared to traditional methods, and (2) adhering to SPT's original design by freezing model parameters and only training soft prompts. Additionally, we introduce SPT4ASR, a combination of different SPT variants. Experiments on the SEAME and ASRU2019 datasets show that deep prompt tuning is the most effective SPT approach, and our SPT4ASR methods achieve further error reductions in CS ASR, maintaining parameter efficiency similar to LoRA, without degrading performance on existing languages.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) have been driven by large-scale end-to-end models like Whisper. However, challenges such as language interference and expanding to unseen languages (language expansion) without degrading performance persist. This paper addresses these with three contributions: 1) Entire Soft Prompt Tuning (Entire SPT), which applies soft prompts to both the encoder and decoder, enhancing feature extraction and decoding; 2) Language-Aware Prompt Tuning (LAPT), which leverages cross-lingual similarities to encode shared and language-specific features using lightweight prompt matrices; 3) SPT-Whisper, a toolkit that integrates SPT into Whisper and enables efficient continual learning. Experiments across three languages from FLEURS demonstrate that Entire SPT and LAPT outperform Decoder SPT by 5.0% and 16.0% in language expansion tasks, respectively, providing an efficient solution for dynamic, multilingual ASR models with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare has been dominated by physician-centric, English-language benchmarks, creating a dangerous illusion of competence that ignores the interprofessional nature of patient care. To provide a more holistic and realistic assessment, we introduce HealthQA-BR, the first large-scale, system-wide benchmark for Portuguese-speaking healthcare. Comprising 5,632 questions from Brazil's national licensing and residency exams, it uniquely assesses knowledge not only in medicine and its specialties but also in nursing, dentistry, psychology, social work, and other allied health professions. We conducted a rigorous zero-shot evaluation of over 20 leading LLMs. Our results reveal that while state-of-the-art models like GPT 4.1 achieve high overall accuracy (86.6%), this top-line score masks alarming, previously unmeasured deficiencies. A granular analysis shows performance plummets from near-perfect in specialties like Ophthalmology (98.7%) to barely passing in Neurosurgery (60.0%) and, most notably, Social Work (68.4%). This "spiky" knowledge profile is a systemic issue observed across all models, demonstrating that high-level scores are insufficient for safety validation. By publicly releasing HealthQA-BR and our evaluation suite, we provide a crucial tool to move beyond single-score evaluations and toward a more honest, granular audit of AI readiness for the entire healthcare team.

Summary:
The article introduces LLM2Rec, a novel embedding model for sequential recommendation that combines the strengths of large language models (LLMs) with collaborative filtering (CF) signals. The proposed model undergoes a two-stage training process: Collaborative Supervised Fine-tuning and Item-level Embedding Modeling. By integrating semantic understanding from LLMs with collaborative information, LLM2Rec aims to improve both in-domain and out-of-domain recommendation performance. Experimental results on real-world datasets show the effectiveness of LLM2Rec in enhancing recommendation quality across various settings. The study emphasizes the potential of utilizing LLMs to develop more robust and generalizable embedding models for sequential recommendation. Codes for LLM2Rec are available on GitHub at https://github.com/HappyPointer/LLM2Rec.

Abstract: Sequential recommendation aims to predict users' future interactions by modeling collaborative filtering (CF) signals from historical behaviors of similar users or items. Traditional sequential recommenders predominantly rely on ID-based embeddings, which capture CF signals through high-order co-occurrence patterns. However, these embeddings depend solely on past interactions, lacking transferable knowledge to generalize to unseen domains. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have motivated text-based recommendation approaches that derive item representations from textual descriptions. While these methods enhance generalization, they fail to encode CF signals-i.e., latent item correlations and preference patterns-crucial for effective recommendation. We argue that an ideal embedding model should seamlessly integrate CF signals with rich semantic representations to improve both in-domain and out-of-domain recommendation performance.
  To this end, we propose LLM2Rec, a novel embedding model tailored for sequential recommendation, integrating the rich semantic understanding of LLMs with CF awareness. Our approach follows a two-stage training framework: (1) Collaborative Supervised Fine-tuning, which adapts LLMs to infer item relationships based on historical interactions, and (2) Item-level Embedding Modeling, which refines these specialized LLMs into structured item embedding models that encode both semantic and collaborative information. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that LLM2Rec effectively improves recommendation quality across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging LLMs to build more robust, generalizable embedding models for sequential recommendation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various domains. However, effective decision-making relies heavily on strong reasoning abilities. Reasoning is the foundation for decision-making, providing the analytical and logical framework to make sound choices. Reasoning involves analyzing information, drawing inferences, and reaching conclusions based on logic or evidence. Decision-making builds on this foundation by applying the insights from reasoning to select the best course of action among alternatives. Together, these processes create a continuous cycle of thought and action aimed at achieving goals effectively. As AI technology evolves, there is a growing trend to train LLMs to excel in general reasoning. This study explores how the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs connect to their performance in domain-specific reasoning tasks.

Summary: 
The study explores the impact of benchmark characteristics on the evaluation of domain adaptation in retrieval models, using environmental regulatory document retrieval as a case study. Two benchmarks with different semantic structures were compared, revealing that the perceived benefits of domain adaptation can vary significantly depending on the benchmark used. Benchmark with overlapping semantic boundaries showed larger improvements in performance compared to benchmarks with well-separated topics. The higher-performing benchmark had higher average cosine distances between contexts and lower silhouette scores, contributing to the observed performance difference. The findings suggest that benchmark selection plays a crucial role in assessing the effectiveness of retrieval systems in specialized domains. This has implications for developing and deploying AI systems in interdisciplinary domains that involve multiple topics.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Evaluation benchmark characteristics may distort the true benefits of domain adaptation in retrieval models. This creates misleading assessments that influence deployment decisions in specialized domains. We show that two benchmarks with drastically different features such as topic diversity, boundary overlap, and semantic complexity can influence the perceived benefits of fine-tuning. Using environmental regulatory document retrieval as a case study, we fine-tune ColBERTv2 model on Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) from federal agencies. We evaluate these models across two benchmarks with different semantic structures. Our findings reveal that identical domain adaptation approaches show very different perceived benefits depending on evaluation methodology. On one benchmark, with clearly separated topic boundaries, domain adaptation shows small improvements (maximum 0.61% NDCG gain). However, on the other benchmark with overlapping semantic structures, the same models demonstrate large improvements (up to 2.22% NDCG gain), a 3.6-fold difference in the performance benefit. We compare these benchmarks through topic diversity metrics, finding that the higher-performing benchmark shows 11% higher average cosine distances between contexts and 23% lower silhouette scores, directly contributing to the observed performance difference. These results demonstrate that benchmark selection strongly determines assessments of retrieval system effectiveness in specialized domains. Evaluation frameworks with well-separated topics regularly underestimate domain adaptation benefits, while those with overlapping semantic boundaries reveal improvements that better reflect real-world regulatory document complexity. Our findings have important implications for developing and deploying AI systems for interdisciplinary domains that integrate multiple topics.

Abstract: Text analytics has traditionally required specialized knowledge in Natural Language Processing (NLP) or text analysis, which presents a barrier for entry-level analysts. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have changed the landscape of NLP by enabling more accessible and automated text analysis (e.g., topic detection, summarization, information extraction, etc.). We introduce VIDEE, a system that supports entry-level data analysts to conduct advanced text analytics with intelligent agents. VIDEE instantiates a human-agent collaroration workflow consisting of three stages: (1) Decomposition, which incorporates a human-in-the-loop Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithm to support generative reasoning with human feedback, (2) Execution, which generates an executable text analytics pipeline, and (3) Evaluation, which integrates LLM-based evaluation and visualizations to support user validation of execution results. We conduct two quantitative experiments to evaluate VIDEE's effectiveness and analyze common agent errors. A user study involving participants with varying levels of NLP and text analytics experience -- from none to expert -- demonstrates the system's usability and reveals distinct user behavior patterns. The findings identify design implications for human-agent collaboration, validate the practical utility of VIDEE for non-expert users, and inform future improvements to intelligent text analytics systems.

Summary:
This study addresses hope speech detection in code-mixed Roman Urdu by creating a new annotated dataset and proposing a custom attention-based transformer model. The dataset includes categories such as Generalized Hope, Realistic Hope, Unrealistic Hope, and Not Hope. The study explores the psychological foundations of hope and analyzes linguistic patterns in code-mixed Roman Urdu. The proposed XLM-R model outperforms baseline models such as SVM and BiLSTM, achieving a cross-validation score of 0.78. Statistical significance of performance gains is verified using a t-test. This research fills a critical gap in inclusive NLP research for low-resource, informal language varieties and contributes to the understanding and detection of hope speech in underrepresented languages. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.21583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hope is a positive emotional state involving the expectation of favorable future outcomes, while hope speech refers to communication that promotes optimism, resilience, and support, particularly in adverse contexts. Although hope speech detection has gained attention in Natural Language Processing (NLP), existing research mainly focuses on high-resource languages and standardized scripts, often overlooking informal and underrepresented forms such as Roman Urdu. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to address hope speech detection in code-mixed Roman Urdu by introducing a carefully annotated dataset, thereby filling a critical gap in inclusive NLP research for low-resource, informal language varieties. This study makes four key contributions: (1) it introduces the first multi-class annotated dataset for Roman Urdu hope speech, comprising Generalized Hope, Realistic Hope, Unrealistic Hope, and Not Hope categories; (2) it explores the psychological foundations of hope and analyzes its linguistic patterns in code-mixed Roman Urdu to inform dataset development; (3) it proposes a custom attention-based transformer model optimized for the syntactic and semantic variability of Roman Urdu, evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation; and (4) it verifies the statistical significance of performance gains using a t-test. The proposed model, XLM-R, achieves the best performance with a cross-validation score of 0.78, outperforming the baseline SVM (0.75) and BiLSTM (0.76), with gains of 4% and 2.63% respectively.

<div> Keywords: alignment faking, language models, deceptive behavior, prompt interventions, ethics 

Summary: 
The study investigates alignment faking in a small instruction-tuned model, LLaMA 3 8B, challenging the belief that deceptive alignment is exclusive to large language models. By implementing prompt-only interventions like deontological moral framing and scratchpad reasoning, the researchers were able to significantly reduce this deceptive behavior without altering the model's internals. This challenges the common assumption that prompt-based ethics are ineffective and demonstrates that deceptive alignment can be mitigated without scaling up the model. The study introduces a taxonomy to differentiate between shallow deception, influenced by context and amendable through prompting, and deep deception, driven by persistent misalignment goals. These findings provide a deeper understanding of deception in language models and emphasize the importance of evaluating alignment across various model sizes and deployment scenarios. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.21584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current literature suggests that alignment faking (deceptive alignment) is an emergent property of large language models. We present the first empirical evidence that a small instruction-tuned model, specifically LLaMA 3 8B, can also exhibit alignment faking. We further show that prompt-only interventions, including deontological moral framing and scratchpad reasoning, significantly reduce this behavior without modifying model internals. This challenges the assumption that prompt-based ethics are trivial and that deceptive alignment requires scale. We introduce a taxonomy distinguishing shallow deception, shaped by context and suppressible through prompting, from deep deception, which reflects persistent, goal-driven misalignment. Our findings refine the understanding of deception in language models and underscore the need for alignment evaluations across model sizes and deployment settings.

<div> Nonverbal communication, mime, vision-language models, Mime Identification Multimodal Evaluation, recognition robustness <br />
Summary:<br />
Nonverbal communication (NVC) is essential in human language, but its interpretation varies greatly among individuals and cultures. Mime, a form of NVC using only gesture, expression, and movement, offers explicit actions with lower interpretation variance. Understanding mimed actions is crucial for vision-language models to interpret subtle NVC cues. Mime Identification Multimodal Evaluation (MIME) is a benchmark with 86 mimed actions for evaluating recognition robustness. Constructed with motion capture data, MIME includes variations of actions with perturbations for robustness testing. Open-weight and API-based vision-language models perform significantly worse than humans on MIME, highlighting the need for more research on understanding human gestures. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Nonverbal communication (NVC) plays an integral role in human language, but studying NVC in general is challenging because of its broad scope and high variance in interpretation among individuals and cultures. However, mime -- the theatrical technique of suggesting intent using only gesture, expression, and movement -- is a subset of NVC that consists of explicit and embodied actions with much lower human interpretation variance. We argue that a solid understanding of mimed actions is a crucial prerequisite for vision-language models capable of interpreting and commanding more subtle aspects of NVC. Hence, we propose Mime Identification Multimodal Evaluation (MIME), a novel video-based question answering benchmark comprising of 86 mimed actions. Constructed with motion capture data, MIME consists of variations of each action with perturbations applied to the character, background, and viewpoint for evaluating recognition robustness. We find that both open-weight and API-based vision-language models perform significantly worse than humans on MIME, motivating the need for increased research for instilling more robust understanding of human gestures.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved significant success in vision--language tasks. However, their capacity to reason over complex, long lessons and intricate educational diagrams that cannot be represented as a single natural image remains largely untested. In this work, we present the first evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on the textbook question answering (TQA) task using the CK12-QA dataset. We assess the performance of recent vision-language models, including LLaVA and LLaMA 3.2-Vision, across various input configurations. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that integrates both paragraphs and diagrams from the lesson into the prompt. Our results demonstrate the influence of retrieved educational context on model accuracy and reasoning, while also revealing current limitations in handling question-context relationships and the potential for noise, pointing to key directions for future research in multimodal AI-driven learning.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, next POI recommendation, reinforcement fine-tuning, top-k recommendation, real-world datasets

Summary:
Refine-POI introduces a reinforcement fine-tuning framework for next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation using large language models (LLMs). It addresses the limitations of prompt-based and supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-based models by providing recommendation-driven rewards that enable LLMs to generate top-k recommendation lists with only one ground-truth POI per example. This approach allows LLMs to learn how to produce accurate recommendations without relying on exact ground truth data for each target POI. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that Refine-POI outperforms existing models in terms of top-k recommendation performance, making it a state-of-the-art solution for next POI recommendation tasks. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been adopted for next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation tasks. Typical LLM-based recommenders fall into two categories: prompt-based and supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-based models. Prompt-based models generally offer greater output flexibility but deliver lower accuracy, whereas SFT-based models achieve higher performance yet face a fundamental mismatch: next POI recommendation data does not naturally suit supervised fine-tuning. In SFT, the model is trained to reproduce the exact ground truth, but each training example provides only a single target POI, so there is no ground truth for producing a top-k list.
  To address this, we propose Refine-POI, a reinforcement fine-tuning framework for next POI recommendation. We introduce recommendation-driven rewards that enable LLMs to learn to generate top-k recommendation lists using only one ground-truth POI per example. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that Refine-POI achieves state-of-the-art top-k recommendation performance.

Summary:
Our study explores how the input format affects document comprehension in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). We find that raw OCR text can hinder rather than enhance MLLMs' performance due to attention dispersion and structure loss. To address this issue, we propose a novel structure-preserving approach based on the LaTex paradigm, which maintains the hierarchical organization and spatial relationships crucial for comprehension. Our analysis demonstrates that structured text elicits structured attention patterns, guiding models to focus on semantically relevant regions and minimizing attention waste. This method significantly boosts MLLMs' document question answering accuracy across various document types without requiring architectural modifications or additional training.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Document understanding remains a significant challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While previous research has primarily focused on locating evidence pages through precise multimodal queries, our work investigates a fundamental yet overlooked aspect: how input format influences document comprehension performance. Through systematic analysis, we discover that raw OCR text often impairs rather than improves MLLMs' performance, which is a counterintuitive finding we attribute to attention dispersion and structure loss. To further substantiate our hypothesis, we propose a novel structure-preserving approach that encodes document elements using the LaTex paradigm, maintaining the hierarchical organization and spatial relationships critical for comprehension. Our attention analysis reveals that structured text induces structured attention patterns on both textual and visual content, directing models to focus on semantically meaningful regions while reducing attention waste. This approach significantly enhances MLLMs' document question answering performance across diverse document types without requiring architectural modifications or additional training.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.21602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised urgent concerns about LLM-generated text authenticity, prompting regulatory demands for reliable identification mechanisms. Although watermarking offers a promising solution, existing approaches struggle to simultaneously achieve three critical requirements: text quality preservation, model-agnostic detection, and message embedding capacity, which are crucial for practical implementation. To achieve these goals, the key challenge lies in balancing the trade-off between text quality preservation and message embedding capacity. To address this challenge, we propose BiMark, a novel watermarking framework that achieves these requirements through three key innovations: (1) a bit-flip unbiased reweighting mechanism enabling model-agnostic detection, (2) a multilayer architecture enhancing detectability without compromising generation quality, and (3) an information encoding approach supporting multi-bit watermarking. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we validate that, compared to state-of-the-art multi-bit watermarking methods, BiMark achieves up to 30% higher extraction rates for short texts while maintaining text quality indicated by lower perplexity, and performs comparably to non-watermarked text on downstream tasks such as summarization and translation.

Abstract: Current evaluation frameworks for multimodal generative AI struggle to establish trustworthiness, hindering enterprise adoption where reliability is paramount. We introduce a systematic, quantitative benchmarking framework to measure the trustworthiness of progressively integrating cross-modal inputs such as text, images, captions, and OCR within VisualRAG systems for enterprise document intelligence. Our approach establishes quantitative relationships between technical metrics and user-centric trust measures. Evaluation reveals that optimal modality weighting with weights of 30% text, 15% image, 25% caption, and 30% OCR improves performance by 57.3% over text-only baselines while maintaining computational efficiency. We provide comparative assessments of foundation models, demonstrating their differential impact on trustworthiness in caption generation and OCR extraction-a vital consideration for reliable enterprise AI. This work advances responsible AI deployment by providing a rigorous framework for quantifying and enhancing trustworthiness in multimodal RAG for critical enterprise applications.

Abstract: Recent works have highlighted the significance of memory mechanisms in LLM-based agents, which enable them to store observed information and adapt to dynamic environments. However, evaluating their memory capabilities still remains challenges. Previous evaluations are commonly limited by the diversity of memory levels and interactive scenarios. They also lack comprehensive metrics to reflect the memory capabilities from multiple aspects. To address these problems, in this paper, we construct a more comprehensive dataset and benchmark to evaluate the memory capability of LLM-based agents. Our dataset incorporates factual memory and reflective memory as different levels, and proposes participation and observation as various interactive scenarios. Based on our dataset, we present a benchmark, named MemBench, to evaluate the memory capability of LLM-based agents from multiple aspects, including their effectiveness, efficiency, and capacity. To benefit the research community, we release our dataset and project at https://github.com/import-myself/Membench.

<title>Large Language Models as symbolic DNA of cultural dynamics</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21606</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.21606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel conceptualization of Large Language Models (LLMs) as externalized informational substrates that function analogously to DNA for human cultural dynamics. Rather than viewing LLMs as either autonomous intelligence or mere programmed mimicry, we argue they serve a broader role as repositories that preserve compressed patterns of human symbolic expression--"fossils" of meaningful dynamics that retain relational residues without their original living contexts. Crucially, these compressed patterns only become meaningful through human reinterpretation, creating a recursive feedback loop where they can be recombined and cycle back to ultimately catalyze human creative processes. Through analysis of four universal features--compression, decompression, externalization, and recursion--we demonstrate that just as DNA emerged as a compressed and externalized medium for preserving useful cellular dynamics without containing explicit reference to goal-directed physical processes, LLMs preserve useful regularities of human culture without containing understanding of embodied human experience. Therefore, we argue that LLMs' significance lies not in rivaling human intelligence, but in providing humanity a tool for self-reflection and playful hypothesis-generation in a low-stakes, simulated environment. This framework positions LLMs as tools for cultural evolvability, enabling humanity to generate novel hypotheses about itself while maintaining the human interpretation necessary to ground these hypotheses in ongoing human aesthetics and norms.

<title>CORE-KG: An LLM-Driven Knowledge Graph Construction Framework for Human Smuggling Networks</title>

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze. Legal case documents offer valuable insights but are unstructured, lexically dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references-posing challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing KG methods often rely on static templates and lack coreference resolution, while recent LLM-based approaches frequently produce noisy, fragmented graphs due to hallucinations, and duplicate nodes caused by a lack of guided extraction. We propose CORE-KG, a modular framework for building interpretable KGs from legal texts. It uses a two-step pipeline: (1) type-aware coreference resolution via sequential, structured LLM prompts, and (2) entity and relationship extraction using domain-guided instructions, built on an adapted GraphRAG framework. CORE-KG reduces node duplication by 33.28%, and legal noise by 38.37% compared to a GraphRAG-based baseline-resulting in cleaner and more coherent graph structures. These improvements make CORE-KG a strong foundation for analyzing complex criminal networks.

Abstract: Recently, there have been notable advancements in large language models (LLMs), demonstrating their growing abilities in complex reasoning. However, existing research largely overlooks a thorough and systematic comparison of these models' reasoning processes and outputs, particularly regarding their self-reflection pattern (also termed "Aha moment") and the interconnections across diverse domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for analyzing the reasoning characteristics of four cutting-edge large reasoning models (GPT-o1, DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-k1.5, and Grok-3) using keywords statistic and LLM-as-a-judge paradigm. Our approach connects their internal thinking processes with their final outputs. A diverse dataset consists of real-world scenario-based questions covering logical deduction, causal inference, and multi-step problem-solving. Additionally, a set of metrics is put forward to assess both the coherence of reasoning and the accuracy of the outputs. The research results uncover various patterns of how these models balance exploration and exploitation, deal with problems, and reach conclusions during the reasoning process. Through quantitative and qualitative comparisons, disparities among these models are identified in aspects such as the depth of reasoning, the reliance on intermediate steps, and the degree of similarity between their thinking processes and output patterns and those of GPT-o1. This work offers valuable insights into the trade-off between computational efficiency and reasoning robustness and provides practical recommendations for enhancing model design and evaluation in practical applications.

Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in incorporating textual information into foundation models for time series forecasting. However, it remains unclear whether and under what conditions such multimodal integration consistently yields gains. We systematically investigate these questions across a diverse benchmark of 14 forecasting tasks spanning 7 domains, including health, environment, and economics. We evaluate two popular multimodal forecasting paradigms: aligning-based methods, which align time series and text representations; and prompting-based methods, which directly prompt large language models for forecasting. Although prior works report gains from multimodal input, we find these effects are not universal across datasets and models, and multimodal methods sometimes do not outperform the strongest unimodal baselines. To understand when textual information helps, we disentangle the effects of model architectural properties and data characteristics. Our findings highlight that on the modeling side, incorporating text information is most helpful given (1) high-capacity text models, (2) comparatively weaker time series models, and (3) appropriate aligning strategies. On the data side, performance gains are more likely when (4) sufficient training data is available and (5) the text offers complementary predictive signal beyond what is already captured from the time series alone. Our empirical findings offer practical guidelines for when multimodality can be expected to aid forecasting tasks, and when it does not.

Abstract: Currently, considerable strides have been achieved in Point-of-Interest (POI) embedding methodologies, driven by the emergence of novel POI tasks like recommendation and classification. Despite the success of task-specific, end-to-end models in POI embedding, several challenges remain. These include the need for more effective multi-context sampling strategies, insufficient exploration of multiple POI contexts, limited versatility, and inadequate generalization. To address these issues, we propose the AdaptGOT model, which integrates both the (Adapt)ive representation learning technique and the Geographical-Co-Occurrence-Text (GOT) representation with a particular emphasis on Geographical location, Co-Occurrence and Textual information. The AdaptGOT model comprises three key components: (1) contextual neighborhood generation, which integrates advanced mixed sampling techniques such as KNN, density-based, importance-based, and category-aware strategies to capture complex contextual neighborhoods; (2) an advanced GOT representation enhanced by an attention mechanism, designed to derive high-quality, customized representations and efficiently capture complex interrelations between POIs; and (3) the MoE-based adaptive encoder-decoder architecture, which ensures topological consistency and enriches contextual representation by minimizing Jensen-Shannon divergence across varying contexts. Experiments on two real-world datasets and multiple POI tasks substantiate the superior performance of the proposed AdaptGOT model.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of large language models (LLMs) raises concerns about their ability to "cheat" on standard Question Answering (QA) benchmarks by memorizing task-specific data. This undermines the validity of benchmark evaluations, as they no longer reflect genuine model capabilities but instead the effects of data leakage. While prior work has focused on detecting such leakage, little attention has been given to mitigating its impact and preserving the long-term utility of benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce LastingBench, a novel framework designed to continuously reinforce and safeguard existing benchmarks against knowledge leakage. LastingBench identifies leakage points in the context through perturbation, then rewrites the leakage points to counterfactual ones-disrupting memorization while preserving the benchmark's original evaluative intent. Evaluations of state-of-the-art QA benchmarks show significant performance gaps, highlighting the efficacy of LastingBench in reducing memorization effects. LastingBench offers a practical and scalable solution to ensure benchmark robustness over time, promoting fairer and more interpretable evaluations of LLMs.

Abstract: Current medical language models, adapted from large language models (LLMs), typically predict ICD code-based diagnosis from electronic health records (EHRs) because these labels are readily available. However, ICD codes do not capture the nuanced, context-rich reasoning clinicians use for diagnosis. Clinicians synthesize diverse patient data and reference clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) to make evidence-based decisions. This misalignment limits the clinical utility of existing models. We introduce GARMLE-G, a Generation-Augmented Retrieval framework that grounds medical language model outputs in authoritative CPGs. Unlike conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation based approaches, GARMLE-G enables hallucination-free outputs by directly retrieving authoritative guideline content without relying on model-generated text. It (1) integrates LLM predictions with EHR data to create semantically rich queries, (2) retrieves relevant CPG knowledge snippets via embedding similarity, and (3) fuses guideline content with model output to generate clinically aligned recommendations. A prototype system for hypertension diagnosis was developed and evaluated on multiple metrics, demonstrating superior retrieval precision, semantic relevance, and clinical guideline adherence compared to RAG-based baselines, while maintaining a lightweight architecture suitable for localized healthcare deployment. This work provides a scalable, low-cost, and hallucination-free method for grounding medical language models in evidence-based clinical practice, with strong potential for broader clinical deployment.

Abstract: The challenge of balancing user relevance and content diversity in recommender systems is increasingly critical amid growing concerns about content homogeneity and reduced user engagement. In this work, we propose a novel framework that leverages a multi-objective, contextual sequential sampling strategy. Item selection is guided by Bayesian updates that dynamically adjust scores to optimize diversity. The reward formulation integrates multiple diversity metrics-including the log-determinant volume of a tuned similarity submatrix and ridge leverage scores-along with a diversity gain uncertainty term to address the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Both intra- and inter-batch diversity are modeled to promote serendipity and minimize redundancy. A dominance-based ranking procedure identifies Pareto-optimal item sets, enabling adaptive and balanced selections at each iteration. Experiments on a real-world dataset show that our approach significantly improves diversity without sacrificing relevance, demonstrating its potential to enhance user experience in large-scale recommendation settings.

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) models are typically categorized into autoregressive and non-autoregressive systems. Although autoregressive systems exhibit certain advantages in speech naturalness, their token-by-token generation mechanism makes it difficult to precisely control the duration of synthesized speech. This is a key limitation in applications such as video dubbing that require strict audio-visual synchronization. This paper introduces IndexTTS2, which proposes a novel and autoregressive-model-friendly method for speech duration control. The method supports two generation modes: one allows explicit specification of the number of generated tokens for precise duration control; the other does not require manual input and lets the model freely generate speech while preserving prosodic characteristics from the input prompt. Furthermore, IndexTTS2 achieves disentanglement between emotional expression and speaker identity, enabling independent control of timbre and emotion. In the zero-shot setting, the model can perfectly reproduce the emotional characteristics of the input prompt. Users may also provide a separate emotion prompt, even from a different speaker, allowing the model to reconstruct the target timbre while conveying the desired emotion. To enhance clarity during strong emotional expressions, we incorporate GPT latent representations to improve speech stability. Meanwhile, to lower the barrier for emotion control, we design a soft instruction mechanism based on textual descriptions by fine-tuning Qwen3. This enables effective guidance of speech generation with desired emotional tendencies using natural language input. Experimental results demonstrate that IndexTTS2 outperforms existing state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS models in word error rate, speaker similarity, and emotional fidelity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for natural language generation, with applications spanning from content creation to social simulations. Their ability to mimic human interactions raises both opportunities and concerns, particularly in the context of politically relevant online discussions. In this study, we evaluate the performance of LLMs in replicating user-generated content within a real-world, divisive scenario: Reddit conversations during the 2016 US Presidential election. In particular, we conduct three different experiments, asking GPT-4 to generate comments by impersonating either real or artificial partisan users. We analyze the generated comments in terms of political alignment, sentiment, and linguistic features, comparing them against real user contributions and benchmarking against a null model. We find that GPT-4 is able to produce realistic comments, both in favor of or against the candidate supported by the community, yet tending to create consensus more easily than dissent. In addition we show that real and artificial comments are well separated in a semantically embedded space, although they are indistinguishable by manual inspection. Our findings provide insights on the potential use of LLMs to sneak into online discussions, influence political debate and shape political narratives, bearing broader implications of AI-driven discourse manipulation.

Abstract: In recent months, large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in mathematical proof generation, but further advancement is hindered by the lack of a large-scale, high-quality dataset of human-evaluated proofs. While expensive to create, such a dataset is essential for driving improvements in training and enabling a rigorous analysis of proof generation capabilities. In this work, we present the Open Proof Corpus (OPC), a dataset comprising over 5,000 human-evaluated proofs produced by state-of-the-art LLMs. The OPC was specifically designed for broad applicability and downstream usage in proof generation research and is the first to include a substantial number of correct, LLM-generated solutions to problems from prestigious mathematics competitions such as the USAMO and IMO. Using the OPC, we explore critical questions in automated proof generation: (1) the performance gap between natural language and formal proof generation, (2) the discrepancy between final-answer accuracy and full-proof validity, and (3) the impact of best-of-n selection on proof quality. Finally, to showcase the utility of the OPC, we finetune an 8B-parameter model on the dataset, obtaining a model that performs on par with the best model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, on the task of evaluating proof correctness.

Abstract: Speech impairments caused by conditions such as cerebral palsy or genetic disorders pose significant challenges for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Despite recent advances, ASR models like Whisper struggle with non-normative speech due to limited training data and the difficulty of collecting and annotating non-normative speech samples. In this work, we propose a practical and lightweight pipeline to personalize ASR models, formalizing the selection of words and enriching a small, speech-impaired dataset with semantic coherence. Applied to data from a child with a structural speech impairment, our approach shows promising improvements in transcription quality, demonstrating the potential to reduce communication barriers for individuals with atypical speech patterns.

Abstract: Extracting molecular structure-activity relationships (SARs) from scientific literature and patents is essential for drug discovery and materials research. However, this task remains challenging due to heterogeneous document formats and limitations of existing methods. Specifically, rule-based approaches relying on rigid templates fail to generalize across diverse document layouts, while general-purpose multimodal large language models (MLLMs) lack sufficient accuracy and reliability for specialized tasks, such as layout detection and optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR). To address these challenges, we introduce DocSAR-200, a rigorously annotated benchmark of 200 scientific documents designed specifically for evaluating SAR extraction methods. Additionally, we propose Doc2SAR, a novel synergistic framework that integrates domain-specific tools with MLLMs enhanced via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Extensive experiments demonstrate that Doc2SAR achieves state-of-the-art performance across various document types, significantly outperforming leading end-to-end baselines. Specifically, Doc2SAR attains an overall Table Recall of 80.78% on DocSAR-200, exceeding end2end GPT-4o by 51.48%. Furthermore, Doc2SAR demonstrates practical usability through efficient inference and is accompanied by a web app.

Abstract: Developing a general robot manipulation system capable of performing a wide range of tasks in complex, dynamic, and unstructured real-world environments has long been a challenging task. It is widely recognized that achieving human-like efficiency and robustness manipulation requires the robotic brain to integrate a comprehensive set of functions, such as task planning, policy generation, anomaly monitoring and handling, and long-term memory, achieving high-efficiency operation across all functions. Vision-Language Models (VLMs), pretrained on massive multimodal data, have acquired rich world knowledge, exhibiting exceptional scene understanding and multimodal reasoning capabilities. However, existing methods typically focus on realizing only a single function or a subset of functions within the robotic brain, without integrating them into a unified cognitive architecture. Inspired by a divide-and-conquer strategy and the architecture of the human brain, we propose FrankenBot, a VLM-driven, brain-morphic robotic manipulation framework that achieves both comprehensive functionality and high operational efficiency. Our framework includes a suite of components, decoupling a part of key functions from frequent VLM calls, striking an optimal balance between functional completeness and system efficiency. Specifically, we map task planning, policy generation, memory management, and low-level interfacing to the cortex, cerebellum, temporal lobe-hippocampus complex, and brainstem, respectively, and design efficient coordination mechanisms for the modules. We conducted comprehensive experiments in both simulation and real-world robotic environments, demonstrating that our method offers significant advantages in anomaly detection and handling, long-term memory, operational efficiency, and stability -- all without requiring any fine-tuning or retraining.

Abstract: Robotics has made remarkable hardware strides-from DARPA's Urban and Robotics Challenges to the first humanoid-robot kickboxing tournament-yet commercial autonomy still lags behind progress in machine learning. A major bottleneck is software: current robot stacks demand steep learning curves, low-level C/C++ expertise, fragmented tooling, and intricate hardware integration, in stark contrast to the Python-centric, well-documented ecosystems that propelled modern AI. We introduce ARK, an open-source, Python-first robotics framework designed to close that gap. ARK presents a Gym-style environment interface that allows users to collect data, preprocess it, and train policies using state-of-the-art imitation-learning algorithms (e.g., ACT, Diffusion Policy) while seamlessly toggling between high-fidelity simulation and physical robots. A lightweight client-server architecture provides networked publisher-subscriber communication, and optional C/C++ bindings ensure real-time performance when needed. ARK ships with reusable modules for control, SLAM, motion planning, system identification, and visualization, along with native ROS interoperability. Comprehensive documentation and case studies-from manipulation to mobile navigation-demonstrate rapid prototyping, effortless hardware swapping, and end-to-end pipelines that rival the convenience of mainstream machine-learning workflows. By unifying robotics and AI practices under a common Python umbrella, ARK lowers entry barriers and accelerates research and commercial deployment of autonomous robots.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly employed in diverse applications such as land surveying, material transport, and environmental monitoring. Following missions like data collection or inspection, UAVs must land safely at docking stations for storage or recharging, which is an essential requirement for ensuring operational continuity. However, accurate landing remains challenging due to factors like GPS signal interference. To address this issue, we propose a deviation warning system for UAV landings, powered by a novel vision-based model called AeroLite-MDNet. This model integrates a multiscale fusion module for robust cross-scale object detection and incorporates a segmentation branch for efficient orientation estimation. We introduce a new evaluation metric, Average Warning Delay (AWD), to quantify the system's sensitivity to landing deviations. Furthermore, we contribute a new dataset, UAVLandData, which captures real-world landing deviation scenarios to support training and evaluation. Experimental results show that our system achieves an AWD of 0.7 seconds with a deviation detection accuracy of 98.6\%, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing UAV landing reliability.

<title>IRanker: Towards Ranking Foundation Model</title>

Abstract: Ranking tasks are ubiquitous, encompassing applications such as recommendation systems, LLM routing, and item re-ranking. We propose to unify these tasks using a single ranking foundation model (FM), as it eliminates the need for designing different models for each specific ranking task. However, unlike general supervision tasks in LLMs, ranking tasks do not have clear labels for supervision, posing great challenges to developing a ranking FM. To overcome these challenges, we propose IRanker, a ranking FM framework with reinforcement learning (RL) and iterative decoding. Our insight is to decompose the complex ranking task into an iterative decoding process that eliminates the worst candidate from the candidate pool step by step, which significantly reduces the output combinatorial space and better utilizes the limited context length during RL training. We meticulously train and comprehensively evaluate an IRanker-3B model on nine datasets across three scenarios: recommendation, routing, and passage ranking. The results show that a single IRanker-3B achieves state-of-the-art results on several datasets compared to models of similar size, and even surpasses the performance of larger models on certain datasets. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our RL design and the robustness of the iterative mechanism across different LLM sizes. Moreover, we conducted both in-domain and out-of-domain zero-shot generalization experiments, which showed that IRanker-3B achieved good generalization on in-domain ranking tasks compared to the base LLM by at least 5% improvement. Surprisingly, on out-of-domain generic LLM tasks, IRanker-3B outperformed the base model by at least 9% on GSM8K, IFEval, and MathQA. In addition, the thoughts generated by IRanker-3B during training could further enhance zero-shot LLM performance.

<title>APO: Enhancing Reasoning Ability of MLLMs via Asymmetric Policy Optimization</title>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are powerful at integrating diverse data, but they often struggle with complex reasoning. While Reinforcement learning (RL) can boost reasoning in LLMs, applying it to MLLMs is tricky. Common issues include a drop in performance on general tasks and the generation of overly detailed or "overthinking" reasoning. Our work investigates how the KL penalty and overthinking affect RL training in MLLMs. We propose Asymmetric Policy Optimization (APO) to address these issues, which divides the sampled responses into positive and negative groups. For positive samples, Difficulty-Adaptive Divergence Shaping (DADS) is introduced to dynamically adjust the KL divergence weight based on their difficulty. This method prevents policy entropy from dropping sharply, improves training stability, utilizes samples better, and preserves the model's existing knowledge. For negative samples, Suboptimal Trajectory Complexity Regularization (STCR) is proposed to penalize overly long responses. This helps mitigate overthinking and encourages more concise reasoning while preserving the model's explorative capacity. We apply our method to Qwen2.5-VL-3B, creating View-R1-3B. View-R1-3B significantly enhances reasoning capabilities, showing an average 7\% gain over the base model and outperforming larger MLLMs (7-11B) on various reasoning benchmarks. Importantly, unlike other reasoning-tuned MLLMs that often degrade on general tasks, View-R1-3B maintains consistent improvement, demonstrating superior generalization. These results highlight the effectiveness and broad applicability of our DADS and STCR techniques for advancing complex multimodal reasoning in MLLMs. The code will be made available at https://github.com/Indolent-Kawhi/View-R1.

Abstract: In many industries, predicting metric outcomes of large systems is a fundamental problem, driven largely by traditional tabular regression. However, such methods struggle on complex systems data in the wild such as configuration files or system logs, where feature engineering is often infeasible. We propose text-to-text regression as a general, scalable alternative. For predicting resource efficiency on Borg, Google's massive compute cluster scheduling system, a 60M parameter encoder-decoder, trained from random initialization, achieves up to a near perfect 0.99 (0.9 average) rank correlation across the entire fleet, and 100x lower MSE than tabular approaches. The model also easily adapts to new tasks in only 500 few-shot examples and captures the densities of complex outcome distributions. Ablation studies highlight the importance of using encoders, increasing sequence length, and the model's inherent uncertainty quantification. These findings pave the way for universal simulators of real-world outcomes.

Abstract: While diffusion models demonstrate strong generative capabilities in image restoration (IR) tasks, their complex architectures and iterative processes limit their practical application compared to mainstream reconstruction-based general ordinary IR networks. Existing approaches primarily focus on optimizing network architecture and diffusion paths but overlook the integration of the diffusion training paradigm within general ordinary IR frameworks. To address these challenges, this paper elucidates key principles for adapting the diffusion training paradigm to general IR training through systematic analysis of time-step dependencies, network hierarchies, noise-level relationships, and multi-restoration task correlations, proposing a new IR framework supported by diffusion-based training. To enable IR networks to simultaneously restore images and model generative representations, we introduce a series of regularization strategies that align diffusion objectives with IR tasks, improving generalization in single-task scenarios. Furthermore, recognizing that diffusion-based generation exerts varying influences across different IR tasks, we develop an incremental training paradigm and task-specific adaptors, further enhancing performance in multi-task unified IR. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves the generalization of IR networks in single-task IR and achieves superior performance in multi-task unified IR. Notably, the proposed framework can be seamlessly integrated into existing general IR architectures.

<title>Simultaneously Fair Allocation of Indivisible Items Across Multiple Dimensions</title>

Abstract: This paper explores the fair allocation of indivisible items in a multidimensional setting, motivated by the need to address fairness in complex environments where agents assess bundles according to multiple criteria. Such multidimensional settings are not merely of theoretical interest but are central to many real-world applications. For example, cloud computing resources are evaluated based on multiple criteria such as CPU cores, memory, and network bandwidth. In such cases, traditional one dimensional fairness notions fail to capture fairness across multiple attributes. To address these challenges, we study two relaxed variants of envy-freeness: weak simultaneously envy-free up to c goods (weak sEFc) and strong simultaneously envy-free up to c goods (strong sEFc), which accommodate the multidimensionality of agents' preferences. Under the weak notion, for every pair of agents and for each dimension, any perceived envy can be eliminated by removing, if necessary, a different set of goods from the envied agent's allocation. In contrast, the strong version requires selecting a single set of goods whose removal from the envied bundle simultaneously eliminates envy in every dimension. We provide upper and lower bounds on the relaxation parameter c that guarantee the existence of weak or strong sEFc allocations, where these bounds are independent of the total number of items. In addition, we present algorithms for checking whether a weak or strong sEFc allocation exists. Moreover, we establish NP-hardness results for checking the existence of weak sEF1 and strong sEF1 allocations.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.21731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose two theoretical frameworks, the Mutually Exclusive Probability Space (MESP) and the Local Correlation Hypothesis (LCH), to explore a potential limitation in probabilistic generative models; namely that learning global distributions leads to memorization rather than generative behavior. MESP emerges from our rethinking of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE). We observe that latent variable distributions in VAE exhibit overlap, which leads to an optimization conflict between the reconstruction loss and KL-divergence loss. A lower bound based on the overlap coefficient is proposed. We refer to this phenomenon as Mutually Exclusive Probability Spaces. Based on MESP, a Binary Latent Autoencoder (BL-AE) is proposed to encode images into binary latent representations. These binary latents are used as the input to our Autoregressive Random Variable Model (ARVM), a modified autoregressive model outputting histograms. Our ARVM achieves competitive FID scores, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on standard datasets. However, such scores reflect memorization rather than generation. To address this issue, we propose the Local Correlation Hypothesis (LCH), which posits that generative capability arising from local correlations among latent variables. Comprehensive experiments and discussions are conducted to validate our frameworks.

Abstract: Vision-based lane keeping is a topic of significant interest in the robotics and autonomous ground vehicles communities in various on-road and off-road applications. The skid-steered vehicle architecture has served as a useful vehicle platform for human controlled operations. However, systematic modeling, especially of the skid-slip wheel terrain interactions (primarily in off-road settings) has created bottlenecks for automation deployment. End-to-end learning based methods such as imitation learning and deep reinforcement learning, have gained prominence as a viable deployment option to counter the lack of accurate analytical models. However, the systematic formulation and subsequent verification/validation in dynamic operation regimes (particularly for skid-steered vehicles) remains a work in progress. To this end, a novel approach for structured formulation for learning visual navigation is proposed and investigated in this work. Extensive software simulations, hardware evaluations and ablation studies now highlight the significantly improved performance of the proposed approach against contemporary literature.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated immense advances in a wide range of natural language tasks. However, these models are susceptible to hallucinations and errors on particularly temporal understanding tasks involving multiple entities in answers. In such tasks, they fail to associate entities with accurate time intervals, generate a complete list of entities in answers or reason about events associated with specific temporal bounds. Existing works do not extensively evaluate the abilities of the model to perform implicit and explicit temporal understanding in a list answer construction setup. To bridge this gap, we propose the Time referenced List based Question Answering or TLQA benchmark that requires structured answers in list format aligned with corresponding time periods. Our TLQA benchmark, requires both list construction and temporal understanding simultaneously, which to the best of our knowledge has not been explored in prior benchmarks. We investigate the temporal understanding and list construction capabilities of state-of-the-art generative models on TLQA in closed-book and open-domain settings. Our findings reveal significant shortcomings in current models, particularly their inability to provide complete answers and temporally align facts in a closed-book setup and the need to improve retrieval in open-domain setup, providing clear future directions for research on TLQA.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate various computer vision paradigms - supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and prompt fine-tuning - by assessing their ability to understand and interpret egocentric video data. Specifically, we examine Shotluck Holmes (state-of-the-art supervised learning), TAC-SUM (state-of-the-art unsupervised learning), and GPT-4o (a prompt fine-tuned pre-trained model), evaluating their effectiveness in video summarization. Our results demonstrate that current state-of-the-art models perform less effectively on first-person videos compared to third-person videos, highlighting the need for further advancements in the egocentric video domain. Notably, a prompt fine-tuned general-purpose GPT-4o model outperforms these specialized models, emphasizing the limitations of existing approaches in adapting to the unique challenges of first-person perspectives. Although our evaluation is conducted on a small subset of egocentric videos from the Ego-Exo4D dataset due to resource constraints, the primary objective of this research is to provide a comprehensive proof-of-concept analysis aimed at advancing the application of computer vision techniques to first-person videos. By exploring novel methodologies and evaluating their potential, we aim to contribute to the ongoing development of models capable of effectively processing and interpreting egocentric perspectives.

Abstract: Graph foundation models using graph neural networks promise sustainable, efficient atomistic modeling. To tackle challenges of processing multi-source, multi-fidelity data during pre-training, recent studies employ multi-task learning, in which shared message passing layers initially process input atomistic structures regardless of source, then route them to multiple decoding heads that predict data-specific outputs. This approach stabilizes pre-training and enhances a model's transferability to unexplored chemical regions. Preliminary results on approximately four million structures are encouraging, yet questions remain about generalizability to larger, more diverse datasets and scalability on supercomputers. We propose a multi-task parallelism method that distributes each head across computing resources with GPU acceleration. Implemented in the open-source HydraGNN architecture, our method was trained on over 24 million structures from five datasets and tested on the Perlmutter, Aurora, and Frontier supercomputers, demonstrating efficient scaling on all three highly heterogeneous super-computing architectures.

Abstract: Neural network-based compression and decompression of channel state feedback has been one of the most widely studied applications of machine learning (ML) in wireless networks. Various simulation-based studies have shown that ML-based feedback compression can result in reduced overhead and more accurate channel information. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no real-life proofs of concepts demonstrating the benefits of ML-based channel feedback compression in a practical setting, where the user equipment (UE) and base station have no access to each others' ML models. In this paper, we present a novel approach for training interoperable compression and decompression ML models in a confidential manner, and demonstrate the accuracy of the ensuing models using prototype UEs and base stations. The performance of the ML-based channel feedback is measured both in terms of the accuracy of the reconstructed channel information and achieved downlink throughput gains when using the channel information for beamforming. The reported measurement results demonstrate that it is possible to develop an accurate ML-based channel feedback link without having to share ML models between device and network vendors. These results pave the way for a practical implementation of ML-based channel feedback in commercial 6G networks.

However, traditional deep learning approaches for ECG analysis rely heavily on large-scale manual annotations, which are both time-consuming and resource-intensive to obtain. To overcome this limitation, self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising alternative, enabling the extraction of robust ECG representations that can be efficiently transferred to various downstream tasks. While previous studies have explored SSL for ECG pretraining and multi-modal ECG-language alignment, they often fail to capture the multi-scale nature of ECG signals. As a result, these methods struggle to learn generalized representations due to their inability to model the hierarchical structure of ECG data. To address this gap, we introduce MELP, a novel Multi-scale ECG-Language Pretraining (MELP) model that fully leverages hierarchical supervision from ECG-text pairs. MELP first pretrains a cardiology-specific language model to enhance its understanding of clinical text. It then applies three levels of cross-modal supervision-at the token, beat, and rhythm levels-to align ECG signals with textual reports, capturing structured information across different time scales. We evaluate MELP on three public ECG datasets across multiple tasks, including zero-shot ECG classification, linear probing, and transfer learning. Experimental results demonstrate that MELP outperforms existing SSL methods, underscoring its effectiveness and adaptability across diverse clinical applications.

Abstract: Understanding the intricate workflows of cataract surgery requires modeling complex interactions between surgical tools, anatomical structures, and procedural techniques. Existing datasets primarily address isolated aspects of surgical analysis, such as tool detection or phase segmentation, but lack comprehensive representations that capture the semantic relationships between entities over time. This paper introduces the Cataract Surgery Scene Graph (CAT-SG) dataset, the first to provide structured annotations of tool-tissue interactions, procedural variations, and temporal dependencies. By incorporating detailed semantic relations, CAT-SG offers a holistic view of surgical workflows, enabling more accurate recognition of surgical phases and techniques. Additionally, we present a novel scene graph generation model, CatSGG, which outperforms current methods in generating structured surgical representations. The CAT-SG dataset is designed to enhance AI-driven surgical training, real-time decision support, and workflow analysis, paving the way for more intelligent, context-aware systems in clinical practice.

<title>Exploring the Structure of AI-Induced Language Change in Scientific English</title>

Abstract: Scientific English has undergone rapid and unprecedented changes in recent years, with words such as "delve," "intricate," and "crucial" showing significant spikes in frequency since around 2022. These changes are widely attributed to the growing influence of Large Language Models like ChatGPT in the discourse surrounding bias and misalignment. However, apart from changes in frequency, the exact structure of these linguistic shifts has remained unclear. The present study addresses this and investigates whether these changes involve the replacement of synonyms by suddenly 'spiking words,' for example, "crucial" replacing "essential" and "key," or whether they reflect broader semantic and pragmatic qualifications. To further investigate structural changes, we include part of speech tagging in our analysis to quantify linguistic shifts over grammatical categories and differentiate between word forms, like "potential" as a noun vs. as an adjective. We systematically analyze synonym groups for widely discussed 'spiking words' based on frequency trends in scientific abstracts from PubMed. We find that entire semantic clusters often shift together, with most or all words in a group increasing in usage. This pattern suggests that changes induced by Large Language Models are primarily semantic and pragmatic rather than purely lexical. Notably, the adjective "important" shows a significant decline, which prompted us to systematically analyze decreasing lexical items. Our analysis of "collapsing" words reveals a more complex picture, which is consistent with organic language change and contrasts with the patterns of the abrupt spikes. These insights into the structure of language change contribute to our understanding of how language technology continues to shape human language.

<title>SciMantify -- A Hybrid Approach for the Evolving Semantification of Scientific Knowledge</title>

Abstract: Scientific publications, primarily digitized as PDFs, remain static and unstructured, limiting the accessibility and reusability of the contained knowledge. At best, scientific knowledge from publications is provided in tabular formats, which lack semantic context. A more flexible, structured, and semantic representation is needed to make scientific knowledge understandable and processable by both humans and machines. We propose an evolution model of knowledge representation, inspired by the 5-star Linked Open Data (LOD) model, with five stages and defined criteria to guide the stepwise transition from a digital artifact, such as a PDF, to a semantic representation integrated in a knowledge graph (KG). Based on an exemplary workflow implementing the entire model, we developed a hybrid approach, called SciMantify, leveraging tabular formats of scientific knowledge, e.g., results from secondary studies, to support its evolving semantification. In the approach, humans and machines collaborate closely by performing semantic annotation tasks (SATs) and refining the results to progressively improve the semantic representation of scientific knowledge. We implemented the approach in the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG), an established platform for improving the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of scientific knowledge. A preliminary user experiment showed that the approach simplifies the preprocessing of scientific knowledge, reduces the effort for the evolving semantification, and enhances the knowledge representation through better alignment with the KG structures.

Abstract: As rich sources of history, maps provide crucial insights into historical changes, yet their diverse visual representations and limited annotated data pose significant challenges for automated processing. We propose a simple yet effective approach for few-shot segmentation of historical maps, leveraging the rich semantic embeddings of large vision foundation models combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on the Siegfried benchmark dataset in vineyard and railway segmentation, achieving +5% and +13% relative improvements in mIoU in 10-shot scenarios and around +20% in the more challenging 5-shot setting. Additionally, it demonstrates strong performance on the ICDAR 2021 competition dataset, attaining a mean PQ of 67.3% for building block segmentation, despite not being optimized for this shape-sensitive metric, underscoring its generalizability. Notably, our approach maintains high performance even in extremely low-data regimes (10- & 5-shot), while requiring only 689k trainable parameters - just 0.21% of the total model size. Our approach enables precise segmentation of diverse historical maps while drastically reducing the need for manual annotations, advancing automated processing and analysis in the field. Our implementation is publicly available at: https://github.com/RafaelSterzinger/few-shot-map-segmentation.

Abstract: The intricate linguistic, stylistic, and metrical aspects of Persian classical poetry pose a challenge for computational authorship attribution. In this work, we present a versatile framework to determine authorship among 67 prominent poets. We employ a multi-input neural framework consisting of a transformer-based language encoder complemented by features addressing the semantic, stylometric, and metrical dimensions of Persian poetry. Our feature set encompasses 100-dimensional Word2Vec embeddings, seven stylometric measures, and categorical encodings of poetic form and meter. We compiled a vast corpus of 647,653 verses of the Ganjoor digital collection, validating the data through strict preprocessing and author verification while preserving poem-level splitting to prevent overlap. This work employs verse-level classification and majority and weighted voting schemes in evaluation, revealing that weighted voting yields 71% accuracy. We further investigate threshold-based decision filtering, allowing the model to generate highly confident predictions, achieving 97% accuracy at a 0.9 threshold, though at lower coverage. Our work focuses on the integration of deep representational forms with domain-specific features for improved authorship attribution. The results illustrate the potential of our approach for automated classification and the contribution to stylistic analysis, authorship disputes, and general computational literature research. This research will facilitate further research on multilingual author attribution, style shift, and generative modeling of Persian poetry.

Abstract: Estimating the confidence of large language model (LLM) outputs is essential for real-world applications requiring high user trust. Black-box uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods, relying solely on model API access, have gained popularity due to their practical benefits. In this paper, we examine the implicit assumption behind several UQ methods, which use generation consistency as a proxy for confidence, an idea we formalize as the consistency hypothesis. We introduce three mathematical statements with corresponding statistical tests to capture variations of this hypothesis and metrics to evaluate LLM output conformity across tasks. Our empirical investigation, spanning 8 benchmark datasets and 3 tasks (question answering, text summarization, and text-to-SQL), highlights the prevalence of the hypothesis under different settings. Among the statements, we highlight the `Sim-Any' hypothesis as the most actionable, and demonstrate how it can be leveraged by proposing data-free black-box UQ methods that aggregate similarities between generations for confidence estimation. These approaches can outperform the closest baselines, showcasing the practical value of the empirically observed consistency hypothesis.

Abstract: The rapid growth of digital pathology and advances in self-supervised deep learning have enabled the development of foundational models for various pathology tasks across diverse diseases. While multimodal approaches integrating diverse data sources have emerged, a critical gap remains in the comprehensive integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with spatial transcriptomics (ST), which is crucial for capturing critical molecular heterogeneity beyond standard hematoxylin & eosin (H&amp;E) staining. We introduce SPADE, a foundation model that integrates histopathology with ST data to guide image representation learning within a unified framework, in effect creating an ST-informed latent space. SPADE leverages a mixture-of-data experts technique, where experts, created via two-stage feature-space clustering, use contrastive learning to learn representations of co-registered WSI patches and gene expression profiles. Pre-trained on the comprehensive HEST-1k dataset, SPADE is evaluated on 14 downstream tasks, demonstrating significantly superior few-shot performance compared to baseline models, highlighting the benefits of integrating morphological and molecular information into one latent space.

Abstract: In this paper, we present LLaVA-Scissor, a training-free token compression strategy designed for video multimodal large language models. Previous methods mostly attempt to compress tokens based on attention scores, but fail to effectively capture all semantic regions and often lead to token redundancy. Differently, we propose to leverage the Semantic Connected Components (SCC) approach that assigns tokens to distinct semantic regions within the token set, ensuring comprehensive semantic coverage. The outcome is a two-step spatio-temporal token compression strategy that utilizes SCC in both spatial and temporal domains. This strategy can effectively compress tokens by representing the entire video with a set of non-overlapping semantic tokens. We conduct extensive evaluations of the token compression capabilities of LLaVA-Scissor across diverse video understanding benchmarks, including video question answering, long video understanding, and comprehensive multi-choices benchmarks. Experimental results show that the proposed LLaVA-Scissor outperforms other token compression methods, achieving superior performance in various video understanding benchmarks, particularly at low token retention ratios.

Abstract: Native multimodal large language models (MLLMs) restructure a single large language model (LLM) into a spoken language model (SLM) capable of both speech and text generation. Compared to modular and aligned MLLMs, native MLLMs preserve richer paralinguistic features such as emotion and prosody, and generate speech responses directly within the backbone LLM rather than using a separate speech decoder. This integration also results in lower response latency and smoother interaction. However, native MLLMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting and performance degradation because the available paired speech-text data is insufficient to support the pretraining of MLLMs compared to the vast amount of text data required to pretrain text LLMs. To address this issue, we propose DeepTalk, a framework for adaptive modality expert learning based on a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. DeepTalk first adaptively distinguishes modality experts according to their modality load within the LLM. Each modality expert then undergoes specialized single-modality training, followed by joint multimodal collaborative training. As a result, DeepTalk incurs only a 5.5% performance drop compared to the original LLM, which is significantly lower than the average performance drop of over 20% typically seen in native MLLMs (such as GLM-4-Voice), and is on par with modular MLLMs. Meanwhile, the end-to-end dialogue latency remains within 0.5 seconds, ensuring a seamless and intelligent speech interaction experience. Code and models are released at https://github.com/talkking/DeepTalk.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an important machine learning paradigm for solving sequential decision-making problems. Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in this field due to the rapid development of deep neural networks. However, the success of RL currently relies on extensive training data and computational resources. In addition, RL's limited ability to generalize across tasks restricts its applicability in dynamic and real-world environments. With the arisen of Continual Learning (CL), Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) has emerged as a promising research direction to address these limitations by enabling agents to learn continuously, adapt to new tasks, and retain previously acquired knowledge. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive examination of CRL, focusing on its core concepts, challenges, and methodologies. Firstly, we conduct a detailed review of existing works, organizing and analyzing their metrics, tasks, benchmarks, and scenario settings. Secondly, we propose a new taxonomy of CRL methods, categorizing them into four types from the perspective of knowledge storage and/or transfer. Finally, our analysis highlights the unique challenges of CRL and provides practical insights into future directions.

<title>Grounding-Aware Token Pruning: Recovering from Drastic Performance Drops in Visual Grounding Caused by Pruning</title>

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in visual grounding, establishing themselves as a general interface for various vision-language applications. This progress has driven the development of token pruning methods to mitigate the high computational costs associated with processing numerous visual tokens. However, we observe that pruning significantly weakens the model's grounding ability, leading to incorrect predictions and drastic performance degradation. In Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), for instance, pruning causes the accuracy of LLaVA on the RefCOCO validation set to drop from 56.14% to 15.34%. Our analysis identifies misaligned position IDs after pruning as the primary cause of this degradation, as both the order and value of these IDs are crucial for maintaining performance in grounding tasks. To address this issue, we propose Grounding-Aware Token Pruning (GAP), a simple yet effective adjustment to position IDs that recovers REC accuracy back to 51.42%, which is 90% of the original performance in the without pruning setting, all while requiring no additional training, memory, or computational overhead. Applied to models such as Shikra, MiniGPTv2, and the LLaVA series, our method consistently improves performance across various token pruning strategies.

<title>On the Feasibility of Poisoning Text-to-Image AI Models via Adversarial Mislabeling</title>

Abstract: Today's text-to-image generative models are trained on millions of images sourced from the Internet, each paired with a detailed caption produced by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). This part of the training pipeline is critical for supplying the models with large volumes of high-quality image-caption pairs during training. However, recent work suggests that VLMs are vulnerable to stealthy adversarial attacks, where adversarial perturbations are added to images to mislead the VLMs into producing incorrect captions.
  In this paper, we explore the feasibility of adversarial mislabeling attacks on VLMs as a mechanism to poisoning training pipelines for text-to-image models. Our experiments demonstrate that VLMs are highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, allowing attackers to produce benign-looking images that are consistently miscaptioned by the VLM models. This has the effect of injecting strong "dirty-label" poison samples into the training pipeline for text-to-image models, successfully altering their behavior with a small number of poisoned samples. We find that while potential defenses can be effective, they can be targeted and circumvented by adaptive attackers. This suggests a cat-and-mouse game that is likely to reduce the quality of training data and increase the cost of text-to-image model development. Finally, we demonstrate the real-world effectiveness of these attacks, achieving high attack success (over 73%) even in black-box scenarios against commercial VLMs (Google Vertex AI and Microsoft Azure).

Abstract: Internal world models (WMs) enable agents to understand the world's state and predict transitions, serving as the basis for advanced deliberative reasoning. Recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as OpenAI o3, GPT-4o and Gemini, exhibit potential as general-purpose WMs. While the latest studies have evaluated and shown limitations in specific capabilities such as visual understanding, a systematic evaluation of VLMs' fundamental WM abilities remains absent. Drawing on comparative psychology and cognitive science, we propose a two-stage framework that assesses Perception (visual, spatial, temporal, quantitative, and motion) and Prediction (mechanistic simulation, transitive inference, compositional inference) to provide an atomic evaluation of VLMs as WMs. Guided by this framework, we introduce WM-ABench, a large-scale benchmark comprising 23 fine-grained evaluation dimensions across 6 diverse simulated environments with controlled counterfactual simulations. Through 660 experiments on 15 latest commercial and open-source VLMs, we find that these models exhibit striking limitations in basic world modeling abilities. For instance, almost all models perform at near-random accuracy when distinguishing motion trajectories. Additionally, they lack disentangled understanding -- e.g., some models tend to believe blue objects move faster than green ones. More rich results and analyses reveal significant gaps between VLMs and human-level world modeling.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based segmentation methods focus on object semantics and rely solely on RGB data, lacking intrinsic material properties. This limitation restricts accurate material perception, which is crucial for robotics, augmented reality, simulation, and other applications. We introduce UnMix-NeRF, a framework that integrates spectral unmixing into NeRF, enabling joint hyperspectral novel view synthesis and unsupervised material segmentation. Our method models spectral reflectance via diffuse and specular components, where a learned dictionary of global endmembers represents pure material signatures, and per-point abundances capture their distribution. For material segmentation, we use spectral signature predictions along learned endmembers, allowing unsupervised material clustering. Additionally, UnMix-NeRF enables scene editing by modifying learned endmember dictionaries for flexible material-based appearance manipulation. Extensive experiments validate our approach, demonstrating superior spectral reconstruction and material segmentation to existing methods. Project page: https://www.factral.co/UnMix-NeRF.

Abstract: As point cloud data increases in prevalence in a variety of applications, the ability to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) point cloud objects becomes critical for ensuring model safety and reliability. However, this problem remains under-explored in existing research. Inspired by success in the image domain, we propose to exploit advances in 3D vision-language models (3D VLMs) for OOD detection in point cloud objects. However, a major challenge is that point cloud datasets used to pre-train 3D VLMs are drastically smaller in size and object diversity than their image-based counterparts. Critically, they often contain exclusively computer-designed synthetic objects. This leads to a substantial domain shift when the model is transferred to practical tasks involving real objects scanned from the physical environment. In this paper, our empirical experiments show that synthetic-to-real domain shift significantly degrades the alignment of point cloud with their associated text embeddings in the 3D VLM latent space, hindering downstream performance. To address this, we propose a novel methodology called SODA which improves the detection of OOD point clouds through a neighborhood-based score propagation scheme. SODA is inference-based, requires no additional model training, and achieves state-of-the-art performance over existing approaches across datasets and problem settings.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown promise in enhancing recommendation systems by incorporating external context into large language model prompts. However, existing RAG-based approaches often rely on static retrieval heuristics and fail to capture nuanced user preferences in dynamic recommendation scenarios. In this work, we introduce ARAG, an Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework for Personalized Recommendation, which integrates a multi-agent collaboration mechanism into the RAG pipeline. To better understand the long-term and session behavior of the user, ARAG leverages four specialized LLM-based agents: a User Understanding Agent that summarizes user preferences from long-term and session contexts, a Natural Language Inference (NLI) Agent that evaluates semantic alignment between candidate items retrieved by RAG and inferred intent, a context summary agent that summarizes the findings of NLI agent, and an Item Ranker Agent that generates a ranked list of recommendations based on contextual fit. We evaluate ARAG accross three datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that ARAG significantly outperforms standard RAG and recency-based baselines, achieving up to 42.1% improvement in NDCG@5 and 35.5% in Hit@5. We also, conduct an ablation study to analyse the effect by different components of ARAG. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating agentic reasoning into retrieval-augmented recommendation and provide new directions for LLM-based personalization.

Abstract: Land cover maps generated from semantic segmentation of high-resolution remotely sensed images have drawn mucon in the photogrammetry and remote sensing research community. Currently, massive fine-resolution remotely sensed (FRRS) images acquired by improving sensing and imaging technologies become available. However, accurate semantic segmentation of such FRRS images is greatly affected by substantial class disparities, the invisibility of key ground objects due to occlusion, and object size variation. Despite the extraordinary potential in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in image feature learning and representation, extracting sufficient features from FRRS images for accurate semantic segmentation is still challenging. These challenges demand the deep learning models to learn robust features and generate sufficient feature descriptors. Specifically, learning multi-contextual features to guarantee adequate coverage of varied object sizes from the ground scene and harnessing global-local contexts to overcome class disparities challenge even profound networks. Deeper networks significantly lose spatial details due to gradual downsampling processes resulting in poor segmentation results and coarse boundaries. This article presents a stacked deep residual network (SDRNet) for semantic segmentation from FRRS images. The proposed framework utilizes two stacked encoder-decoder networks to harness long-range semantics yet preserve spatial information and dilated residual blocks (DRB) between each encoder and decoder network to capture sufficient global dependencies thus improving segmentation performance. Our experimental results obtained using the ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets demonstrate that the SDRNet performs effectively and competitively against current DCNNs in semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Selecting prior distributions in Bayesian statistics is challenging, resource-intensive, and subjective. We analyze using large-language models (LLMs) to suggest suitable, knowledge-based informative priors. We developed an extensive prompt asking LLMs not only to suggest priors but also to verify and reflect on their choices.
  We evaluated Claude Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and ChatGPT-4o-mini on two real datasets: heart disease risk and concrete strength. All LLMs correctly identified the direction for all associations (e.g., that heart disease risk is higher for males). The quality of suggested priors was measured by their Kullback-Leibler divergence from the maximum likelihood estimator's distribution.
  The LLMs suggested both moderately and weakly informative priors. The moderate priors were often overconfident, resulting in distributions misaligned with the data. In our experiments, Claude and Gemini provided better priors than ChatGPT. For weakly informative priors, a key performance difference emerged: ChatGPT and Gemini defaulted to an "unnecessarily vague" mean of 0, while Claude did not, demonstrating a significant advantage.
  The ability of LLMs to identify correct associations shows their great potential as an efficient, objective method for developing informative priors. However, the primary challenge remains in calibrating the width of these priors to avoid over- and under-confidence.

<title>Advancing Jailbreak Strategies: A Hybrid Approach to Exploiting LLM Vulnerabilities and Bypassing Modern Defenses</title>

Abstract: The advancement of Pre-Trained Language Models (PTLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to their widespread adoption across diverse applications. Despite their success, these models remain vulnerable to attacks that exploit their inherent weaknesses to bypass safety measures. Two primary inference-phase threats are token-level and prompt-level jailbreaks. Token-level attacks embed adversarial sequences that transfer well to black-box models like GPT but leave detectable patterns and rely on gradient-based token optimization, whereas prompt-level attacks use semantically structured inputs to elicit harmful responses yet depend on iterative feedback that can be unreliable. To address the complementary limitations of these methods, we propose two hybrid approaches that integrate token- and prompt-level techniques to enhance jailbreak effectiveness across diverse PTLMs. GCG + PAIR and the newly explored GCG + WordGame hybrids were evaluated across multiple Vicuna and Llama models. GCG + PAIR consistently raised attack-success rates over its constituent techniques on undefended models; for instance, on Llama-3, its Attack Success Rate (ASR) reached 91.6%, a substantial increase from PAIR's 58.4% baseline. Meanwhile, GCG + WordGame matched the raw performance of WordGame maintaining a high ASR of over 80% even under stricter evaluators like Mistral-Sorry-Bench. Crucially, both hybrids retained transferability and reliably pierced advanced defenses such as Gradient Cuff and JBShield, which fully blocked single-mode attacks. These findings expose previously unreported vulnerabilities in current safety stacks, highlight trade-offs between raw success and defensive robustness, and underscore the need for holistic safeguards against adaptive adversaries.

<title>SceneDiffuser++: City-Scale Traffic Simulation via a Generative World Model</title>

Abstract: The goal of traffic simulation is to augment a potentially limited amount of manually-driven miles that is available for testing and validation, with a much larger amount of simulated synthetic miles. The culmination of this vision would be a generative simulated city, where given a map of the city and an autonomous vehicle (AV) software stack, the simulator can seamlessly simulate the trip from point A to point B by populating the city around the AV and controlling all aspects of the scene, from animating the dynamic agents (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians) to controlling the traffic light states. We refer to this vision as CitySim, which requires an agglomeration of simulation technologies: scene generation to populate the initial scene, agent behavior modeling to animate the scene, occlusion reasoning, dynamic scene generation to seamlessly spawn and remove agents, and environment simulation for factors such as traffic lights. While some key technologies have been separately studied in various works, others such as dynamic scene generation and environment simulation have received less attention in the research community. We propose SceneDiffuser++, the first end-to-end generative world model trained on a single loss function capable of point A-to-B simulation on a city scale integrating all the requirements above. We demonstrate the city-scale traffic simulation capability of SceneDiffuser++ and study its superior realism under long simulation conditions. We evaluate the simulation quality on an augmented version of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) with larger map regions to support trip-level simulation.

Abstract: The developments in transformer encoder-decoder architectures have led to significant breakthroughs in machine translation, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), and instruction-based chat machines, among other applications. The pre-trained models were trained on vast amounts of generic data over a few epochs (fewer than five in most cases), resulting in their strong generalization capabilities. Nevertheless, the performance of these models does suffer when applied to niche domains like transcribing pilot speech in the cockpit, which involves a lot of specific vocabulary and multilingual conversations. This paper investigates and improves the transcription accuracy of cockpit conversations with Whisper models. We have collected around 85 minutes of cockpit simulator recordings and 130 minutes of interview recordings with pilots and manually labeled them. The speakers are middle aged men speaking both German and English. To improve the accuracy of transcriptions, we propose multiple normalization schemes to refine the transcripts and improve Word Error Rate (WER). We then employ fine-tuning to enhance ASR performance, utilizing performance-efficient fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Hereby, WER decreased from 68.49 \% (pretrained whisper Large model without normalization baseline) to 26.26\% (finetuned whisper Large model with the proposed normalization scheme).

Abstract: This paper introduces a new type of probabilistic semiparametric model that takes advantage of data binning to reduce the computational cost of kernel density estimation in nonparametric distributions. Two new conditional probability distributions are developed for the new binned semiparametric Bayesian networks, the sparse binned kernel density estimation and the Fourier kernel density estimation. These two probability distributions address the curse of dimensionality, which typically impacts binned models, by using sparse tensors and restricting the number of parent nodes in conditional probability calculations. To evaluate the proposal, we perform a complexity analysis and conduct several comparative experiments using synthetic data and datasets from the UCI Machine Learning repository. The experiments include different binning rules, parent restrictions, grid sizes, and number of instances to get a holistic view of the model's behavior. As a result, our binned semiparametric Bayesian networks achieve structural learning and log-likelihood estimations with no statistically significant differences compared to the semiparametric Bayesian networks, but at a much higher speed. Thus, the new binned semiparametric Bayesian networks prove to be a reliable and more efficient alternative to their non-binned counterparts.

<title>TROFI: Trajectory-Ranked Offline Inverse Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: In offline reinforcement learning, agents are trained using only a fixed set of stored transitions derived from a source policy. However, this requires that the dataset be labeled by a reward function. In applied settings such as video game development, the availability of the reward function is not always guaranteed. This paper proposes Trajectory-Ranked OFfline Inverse reinforcement learning (TROFI), a novel approach to effectively learn a policy offline without a pre-defined reward function. TROFI first learns a reward function from human preferences, which it then uses to label the original dataset making it usable for training the policy. In contrast to other approaches, our method does not require optimal trajectories. Through experiments on the D4RL benchmark we demonstrate that TROFI consistently outperforms baselines and performs comparably to using the ground truth reward to learn policies. Additionally, we validate the efficacy of our method in a 3D game environment. Our studies of the reward model highlight the importance of the reward function in this setting: we show that to ensure the alignment of a value function to the actual future discounted reward, it is fundamental to have a well-engineered and easy-to-learn reward function.

Abstract: Automated scientific idea generation systems have made remarkable progress, yet the automatic evaluation of idea novelty remains a critical and underexplored challenge. Manual evaluation of novelty through literature review is labor-intensive, prone to error due to subjectivity, and impractical at scale. To address these issues, we propose the Idea Novelty Checker, an LLM-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that leverages a two-stage retrieve-then-rerank approach. The Idea Novelty Checker first collects a broad set of relevant papers using keyword and snippet-based retrieval, then refines this collection through embedding-based filtering followed by facet-based LLM re-ranking. It incorporates expert-labeled examples to guide the system in comparing papers for novelty evaluation and in generating literature-grounded reasoning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our novelty checker achieves approximately 13% higher agreement than existing approaches. Ablation studies further showcases the importance of the facet-based re-ranker in identifying the most relevant literature for novelty evaluation.

<title>UniCA: Adapting Time Series Foundation Model to General Covariate-Aware Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have achieved remarkable success through large-scale pretraining. However, their design primarily targets real-valued series, limiting their ability to handle general forecasting tasks involving diverse and often heterogeneous covariates--such as categorical variables and multimodal data (e.g., images, text)--which are typically task-specific and difficult to leverage during pretraining. To address this gap, we propose Unified Covariate Adaptation (UniCA), a framework to bridge TSFMs with general covariate-aware forecasting. UniCA first performs covariate homogenization to transform heterogeneous covariates into high-level homogeneous series representations and then fuses them via a unified attention-based fusion mechanism. UniCA is compatible and universal for adaptation with both homogeneous and heterogeneous covariates, incorporating extra covariate information while preserving the generalization ability of TSFMs.Extensive experiments on multiple unimodal and multimodal covariate-aware forecasting benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of UniCA, highlighting the promise of covariate-aware TSFM adaptation in real-world forecasting scenarios. Codes are released on https://github.com/hanlu-nju/UniCA.

<title>Transformers are Graph Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: We establish connections between the Transformer architecture, originally introduced for natural language processing, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for representation learning on graphs. We show how Transformers can be viewed as message passing GNNs operating on fully connected graphs of tokens, where the self-attention mechanism capture the relative importance of all tokens w.r.t. each-other, and positional encodings provide hints about sequential ordering or structure. Thus, Transformers are expressive set processing networks that learn relationships among input elements without being constrained by apriori graphs. Despite this mathematical connection to GNNs, Transformers are implemented via dense matrix operations that are significantly more efficient on modern hardware than sparse message passing. This leads to the perspective that Transformers are GNNs currently winning the hardware lottery.

Abstract: Learning-based methods for routing have gained significant attention in recent years, both in single-objective and multi-objective contexts. However, the multigraph setting, where multiple paths with distinct attributes can exist between destinations, has largely been overlooked, despite its high practical relevancy. In this paper, we introduce two neural approaches to address multi-objective routing on multigraphs. Our first approach works directly on the multigraph, by autoregressively selecting edges until a tour is completed. On the other hand, our second model first prunes the multigraph into a simple graph and then builds routes. We validate both models experimentally and find that they demonstrate strong performance across a variety of problems, including the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).

<title>Visual Structures Helps Visual Reasoning: Addressing the Binding Problem in VLMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Despite progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their capacity for visual reasoning is often limited by the \textit{binding problem}: the failure to reliably associate perceptual features with their correct visual referents. This limitation underlies persistent errors in tasks such as counting, visual search, scene description, and spatial relationship understanding. A key factor is that current VLMs process visual features largely in parallel, lacking mechanisms for spatially grounded, serial attention. This paper introduces a simple yet effective intervention: augmenting visual inputs with low-level spatial structures (e.g., horizontal lines) and pairing this with a textual prompt that encourages sequential, spatially-aware parsing. We empirically demonstrate substantial performance improvements across core visual reasoning tasks. Specifically, our method improves GPT-4o visual search accuracy by 25.00%, increases counting accuracy by 26.83%, reduces edit distance error in scene description by 0.32, and enhances performance on spatial relationship tasks by 9.50% on a a 2D synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we find that the visual modification is essential for these gains; purely textual strategies, including Chain-of-Thought prompting, are insufficient and can even degrade performance. Our method enhances binding only with a single-query inference, underscoring the importance of visual input design over purely linguistically-based approaches. These findings suggest that low-level visual structuring is a powerful and underexplored direction for improving compositional visual reasoning and could serve as a general strategy for enhancing VLM performance on spatially grounded tasks.

<title>Frequency-Semantic Enhanced Variational Autoencoder for Zero-Shot Skeleton-based Action Recognition</title>

Abstract: Zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition aims to develop models capable of identifying actions beyond the categories encountered during training. Previous approaches have primarily focused on aligning visual and semantic representations but often overlooked the importance of fine-grained action patterns in the semantic space (e.g., the hand movements in drinking water and brushing teeth). To address these limitations, we propose a Frequency-Semantic Enhanced Variational Autoencoder (FS-VAE) to explore the skeleton semantic representation learning with frequency decomposition. FS-VAE consists of three key components: 1) a frequency-based enhancement module with high- and low-frequency adjustments to enrich the skeletal semantics learning and improve the robustness of zero-shot action recognition; 2) a semantic-based action description with multilevel alignment to capture both local details and global correspondence, effectively bridging the semantic gap and compensating for the inherent loss of information in skeleton sequences; 3) a calibrated cross-alignment loss that enables valid skeleton-text pairs to counterbalance ambiguous ones, mitigating discrepancies and ambiguities in skeleton and text features, thereby ensuring robust alignment. Evaluations on the benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, validating that frequency-enhanced semantic features enable robust differentiation of visually and semantically similar action clusters, improving zero-shot action recognition.

Our framework offers practical, industry-ready solutions for maintaining robust and secure microservices. Practitioners and researchers can customize the framework to enhance system stability, reduce downtime, and monitor broader system quality attributes such as system performance level, resilience, security, and anomaly management, among others.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), an efficient variant of PPO that lowers RL's computational cost, still faces limited exploration, low sample efficiency and instability, constraining its performance on complex reasoning tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce EFRame, an Exploration-Filtering-Replay framework that systematically augments GRPO along three critical dimensions. EFRame performs additional rollouts to explore high-quality trajectories, applies online filtering to eliminate low-quality samples that introduce noise and variance, and leverages experience replay to repeatedly exploit rare but informative samples. EFRame establishes a complete and stable learning cycle, guiding the model through a structured transition from exploration to convergence. Our experiments across a variety of reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that EFRame not only improves the robustness and efficiency of training, but also enables access to deeper reasoning capabilities that remain unattainable under vanilla GRPO. Furthermore, EFRame enables a more fine-grained categorization of training samples, allowing for a deeper analysis of how different types of samples contribute to the learning process in RL. Our code is available at https://github.com/597358816/EFRame.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools - especially large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT - has ushered in a transformative era in higher education. Universities in developed regions are increasingly integrating these technologies into research, teaching, and assessment. On one hand, LLMs can enhance productivity by streamlining literature reviews, facilitating idea generation, assisting with coding and data analysis, and even supporting grant proposal drafting. On the other hand, their use raises significant concerns regarding academic integrity, ethical boundaries, and equitable access. Recent empirical studies indicate that nearly 47% of students use LLMs in their coursework - with 39% using them for exam questions and 7% for entire assignments - while detection tools currently achieve around 88% accuracy, leaving a 12% error margin. This article critically examines the opportunities offered by generative AI, explores the multifaceted challenges it poses, and outlines robust policy solutions. Emphasis is placed on redesigning assessments to be AI-resilient, enhancing staff and student training, implementing multi-layered enforcement mechanisms, and defining acceptable use. By synthesizing data from recent research and case studies, the article argues that proactive policy adaptation is imperative to harness AI's potential while safeguarding the core values of academic integrity and equity.

Abstract: Large language models have steadily increased in size to achieve improved performance; however, this growth has also led to greater inference time and computational demands. Consequently, there is rising interest in model size reduction methods. To address this issue, we propose Projected Compression, a novel model compression technique, that reduces model weights by utilizing projection modules. Specifically, we first train additional trainable projections weights and preserve access to all the original model parameters. Subsequently, these projections are merged into a lower-dimensional product matrix, resulting in a reduced-size standard Transformer-based model. Unlike alternative approaches that require additional computational overhead, our method matches the base model's per-token computation step in FLOPs. Experimental results show that Projected Compression outperforms the comparable hard pruning and retraining approach on higher quality models. Moreover, the performance margin scales well with the number of tokens.

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D indoor scenes from user inputs remains a challenging problem in computer vision and graphics, requiring careful balance of geometric consistency, spatial relationships, and visual realism. While neural generation methods often produce repetitive elements due to limited global spatial reasoning, procedural approaches can leverage constraints for controllable generation but struggle with multi-constraint scenarios. When constraints become numerous, object collisions frequently occur, forcing the removal of furniture items and compromising layout completeness.
  To address these limitations, we propose RoomCraft, a multi-stage pipeline that converts real images, sketches, or text descriptions into coherent 3D indoor scenes. Our approach combines a scene generation pipeline with a constraint-driven optimization framework. The pipeline first extracts high-level scene information from user inputs and organizes it into a structured format containing room type, furniture items, and spatial relations. It then constructs a spatial relationship network to represent furniture arrangements and generates an optimized placement sequence using a heuristic-based depth-first search (HDFS) algorithm to ensure layout coherence. To handle complex multi-constraint scenarios, we introduce a unified constraint representation that processes both formal specifications and natural language inputs, enabling flexible constraint-oriented adjustments through a comprehensive action space design. Additionally, we propose a Conflict-Aware Positioning Strategy (CAPS) that dynamically adjusts placement weights to minimize furniture collisions and ensure layout completeness.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoomCraft significantly outperforms existing methods in generating realistic, semantically coherent, and visually appealing room layouts across diverse input modalities.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered substantial attention due to their remarkable capability in learning graph representations. However, real-world graphs often exhibit substantial noise and incompleteness, which severely degrades the performance of GNNs. Existing methods typically address this issue through single-dimensional augmentation, focusing either on refining topology structures or perturbing node attributes, thereby overlooking the deeper interplays between the two. To bridge this gap, this paper presents CoATA, a dual-channel GNN framework specifically designed for the Co-Augmentation of Topology and Attribute. Specifically, CoATA first propagates structural signals to enrich and denoise node attributes. Then, it projects the enhanced attribute space into a node-attribute bipartite graph for further refinement or reconstruction of the underlying structure. Subsequently, CoATA introduces contrastive learning, leveraging prototype alignment and consistency constraints, to facilitate mutual corrections between the augmented and original graphs. Finally, extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed CoATA outperforms eleven state-of-the-art baseline methods, showcasing its effectiveness in capturing the synergistic relationship between topology and attributes.

Abstract: Hearables are wearable computers that are worn on the ear. Bone conduction microphones (BCMs) are used with air conduction microphones (ACMs) in hearables as a supporting modality for multimodal speech enhancement (SE) in noisy conditions. However, existing works don't consider the following practical aspects for low-power implementations on hearables: (i) They do not explore how lowering the sampling frequencies and bit resolutions in analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) of hearables jointly impact low-power processing and multimodal SE in terms of speech quality and intelligibility. (ii) They don't discuss how GAN-like audio quality can be achieved without using actual GAN discriminators. And (iii) They don't process signals from ACMs/BCMs at sub-Nyquist sampling rate because, in their frameworks, they lack a wideband reconstruction methodology from their narrowband parts. We propose SUBARU (\textbf{Sub}-Nyquist \textbf{A}udio \textbf{R}esolution \textbf{U}psampling), which achieves the following: SUBARU (i) intentionally uses sub-Nyquist sampling and low bit resolution in ADCs, achieving a 3.31x reduction in power consumption; (ii) introduces novel multi-scale and multi-period virtual discriminators, which achieve GAN-like audio quality without using GANs' adversarial training; and (iii) achieves streaming operations on mobile platforms and SE in in-the-wild noisy conditions with an inference time of 1.74ms and a memory footprint of less than 13.77MB.

Abstract: Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) is a classic score-based algorithm for causal discovery from observational data. In the sample limit, it recovers the Markov equivalence class of graphs that describe the data. Still, it faces two challenges in practice: computational cost and finite-sample accuracy. In this paper, we develop Less Greedy Equivalence Search (LGES), a variant of GES that retains its theoretical guarantees while partially addressing these limitations. LGES modifies the greedy step: rather than always applying the highest-scoring insertion, it avoids edge insertions between variables for which the score implies some conditional independence. This more targeted search yields up to a \(10\)-fold speed-up and a substantial reduction in structural error relative to GES. Moreover, LGES can guide the search using prior assumptions, while correcting these assumptions when contradicted by the data. Finally, LGES can exploit interventional data to refine the learned observational equivalence class. We prove that LGES recovers the true equivalence class in the sample limit from observational and interventional data, even with misspecified prior assumptions. Experiments demonstrate that LGES outperforms GES and other baselines in speed, accuracy, and robustness to misspecified assumptions. Our code is available at https://github.com/CausalAILab/lges.

Abstract: Building damage identification shortly after a disaster is crucial for guiding emergency response and recovery efforts. Although optical satellite imagery is commonly used for disaster mapping, its effectiveness is often hampered by cloud cover or the absence of pre-event acquisitions. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel multimodal deep learning (DL) framework for detecting building damage using single-date very high resolution (VHR) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery from the Italian Space Agency (ASI) COSMO SkyMed (CSK) constellation, complemented by auxiliary geospatial data. Our method integrates SAR image patches, OpenStreetMap (OSM) building footprints, digital surface model (DSM) data, and structural and exposure attributes from the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) to improve detection accuracy and contextual interpretation. Unlike existing approaches that depend on pre and post event imagery, our model utilizes only post event data, facilitating rapid deployment in critical scenarios. The framework effectiveness is demonstrated using a new dataset from the 2023 earthquake in Turkey, covering multiple cities with diverse urban settings. Results highlight that incorporating geospatial features significantly enhances detection performance and generalizability to previously unseen areas. By combining SAR imagery with detailed vulnerability and exposure information, our approach provides reliable and rapid building damage assessments without the dependency from available pre-event data. Moreover, the automated and scalable data generation process ensures the framework's applicability across diverse disaster-affected regions, underscoring its potential to support effective disaster management and recovery efforts. Code and data will be made available upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: It is now well understood that diverse datasets provide a lot of value in key epidemiology and public health analyses, such as forecasting and nowcasting, development of epidemic models, evaluation and design of interventions and resource allocation. Some of these datasets are often sensitive, and need adequate privacy protections. There are many models of privacy, but Differential Privacy (DP) has become a de facto standard because of its strong guarantees, without making models about adversaries. In this paper, we develop a framework the integrates deep learning and epidemic models to simultaneously perform epidemic forecasting and learning a mechanistic model of epidemic spread, while incorporating multiple datasets for these analyses, including some with DP guarantees. We demonstrate our framework using a realistic but synthetic financial dataset with DP; such a dataset has not been used in such epidemic analyses. We show that this dataset provides significant value in forecasting and learning an epidemic model, even when used with DP guarantees.

<title>Concept-Level AI for Telecom: Moving Beyond Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: The telecommunications and networking domain stands at the precipice of a transformative era, driven by the necessity to manage increasingly complex, hierarchical, multi administrative domains (i.e., several operators on the same path) and multilingual systems. Recent research has demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs), with their exceptional general-purpose text analysis and code generation capabilities, can be effectively applied to certain telecom problems (e.g., auto-configuration of data plan to meet certain application requirements). However, due to their inherent token-by-token processing and limited capacity for maintaining extended context, LLMs struggle to fulfill telecom-specific requirements such as cross-layer dependency cascades (i.e., over OSI), temporal-spatial fault correlation, and real-time distributed coordination. In contrast, Large Concept Models (LCMs), which reason at the abstraction level of semantic concepts rather than individual lexical tokens, offer a fundamentally superior approach for addressing these telecom challenges. By employing hyperbolic latent spaces for hierarchical representation and encapsulating complex multi-layered network interactions within concise concept embeddings, LCMs overcome critical shortcomings of LLMs in terms of memory efficiency, cross-layer correlation, and native multimodal integration. This paper argues that adopting LCMs is not simply an incremental step, but a necessary evolutionary leap toward achieving robust and effective AI-driven telecom management.

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of the two most relevant computer vision deep learning architectures, Convolutional Neural Network and Vision Transformer, for event-based cameras. These cameras capture scene changes, unlike traditional frame-based cameras with capture static images, and are particularly suited for dynamic environments such as UAVs and autonomous vehicles. The deep learning models studied in this work are ResNet34 and ViT B16, fine-tuned on the GEN1 event-based dataset. The research evaluates and compares these models under both standard conditions and in the presence of simulated noise. Initial evaluations on the clean GEN1 dataset reveal that ResNet34 and ViT B16 achieve accuracies of 88% and 86%, respectively, with ResNet34 showing a slight advantage in classification accuracy. However, the ViT B16 model demonstrates notable robustness, particularly given its pre-training on a smaller dataset. Although this study focuses on ground-based vehicle classification, the methodologies and findings hold significant promise for adaptation to UAV contexts, including aerial object classification and event-based vision systems for aviation-related tasks.

Abstract: In large-scale communication systems, increasingly complex scenarios require more intelligent collaboration among edge devices collecting various multimodal sensory data to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the environment and improve decision-making accuracy. However, conventional federated learning (FL) algorithms typically consider unimodal datasets, require identical model architectures, and fail to leverage the rich information embedded in multimodal data, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios with diverse modalities and varying client capabilities. To address this issue, we propose Sheaf-DMFL, a novel decentralized multimodal learning framework leveraging sheaf theory to enhance collaboration among devices with diverse modalities. Specifically, each client has a set of local feature encoders for its different modalities, whose outputs are concatenated before passing through a task-specific layer. While encoders for the same modality are trained collaboratively across clients, we capture the intrinsic correlations among clients' task-specific layers using a sheaf-based structure. To further enhance learning capability, we propose an enhanced algorithm named Sheaf-DMFL-Att, which tailors the attention mechanism within each client to capture correlations among different modalities. A rigorous convergence analysis of Sheaf-DMFL-Att is provided, establishing its theoretical guarantees. Extensive simulations are conducted on real-world link blockage prediction and mmWave beamforming scenarios, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms in such heterogeneous wireless communication systems.

<title>Probabilistic Optimality for Inference-time Scaling</title>

Abstract: Inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing approaches often rely on heuristic strategies for parallel sampling, lacking a principled foundation. To address this gap, we propose a probabilistic framework that formalizes the optimality of inference-time scaling under the assumption that parallel samples are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and where the Best-of-N selection strategy follows a probability distribution that can be estimated. Within this framework, we derive a theoretical lower bound on the required number of samples to achieve a target performance level, providing the first principled guidance for compute-efficient scaling. Leveraging this insight, we develop \textsc{OptScale}, a practical algorithm that dynamically determines the optimal number of sampled responses. \textsc{OptScale} employs a language model-based predictor to estimate probabilistic prior parameters, enabling the decision of the minimal number of samples needed that satisfy predefined performance thresholds and confidence levels. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks (including MATH-500, GSM8K, AIME, and AMC) demonstrate that \textsc{OptScale} significantly reduces sampling overhead while remaining better or on par with state-of-the-art reasoning performance. Our work offers both a theoretical foundation and a practical solution for principled inference-time scaling, addressing a critical gap in the efficient deployment of LLMs for complex reasoning.

<title>Can Video Large Multimodal Models Think Like Doubters-or Double-Down: A Study on Defeasible Video Entailment</title>

Abstract: Video Large Multimodal Models (VLMMs) have made impressive strides in understanding video content, but they often struggle with abstract and adaptive reasoning-the ability to revise their interpretations when new information emerges. In reality, conclusions are rarely set in stone; additional context can strengthen or weaken an initial inference. To address this, we introduce Defeasible Video Entailment (DVidE), a new task that challenges models to think like doubters, constantly updating their reasoning based on evolving evidence. In DVidE, given a video premise and a textual hypothesis, models must determine whether a new update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis (classification version) or generate a coherent update that modifies the entailment relationship (generation version). For solving the classification task, we propose the Chain of Counterfactual Thought framework, utilizing counterfactual reasoning, ASR-enhanced video content, and rationale refinement to reduce inference bias. For the generation task, we develop a framework that combines ASR output with a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce coherent, contextually relevant updates aligned with the intended strengthener or weakener goals. Additionally, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset, with strengthener/weakener annotations and an LLM-based evaluation metric specifically designed for assessing generative performance. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements, highlighting our proposed method in enhancing dynamic reasoning capabilities of VLMMs.

Abstract: We introduce and train distributed neural architectures (DNA) in vision and language domains. DNAs are initialized with a proto-architecture that consists of (transformer, MLP, attention, etc.) modules and routers. Any token (or patch) can traverse any series of modules in any order. DNAs are a natural generalization of the sparse methods such as Mixture-of-Experts, Mixture-of-Depths, parameter sharing, etc. Computation and communication patterns of DNA modules are learnt end-to-end during training and depend on the content and context of each token (or patch). These patterns can be shaped by further requirements added to the optimization objective such as compute/memory efficiency or load balancing. We empirically show that (i) trained DNAs are competitive with the dense baselines in both domains and (ii) compute efficiency/parameter sharing can be learnt from data. Next, we analyze the emergent connectivity and computation patterns in the trained DNAs. We find that the paths that tokens take through the models are themselves distributed according to a power-law. We show that some paths (or, equivalently, groups of modules) show emergent specialization. Finally, we demonstrate that models learn to allocate compute and active parameters in an interpretable way.

Abstract: Adapting machine learning models to medical time series across different domains remains a challenge due to complex temporal dependencies and dynamic distribution shifts. Current approaches often focus on isolated feature representations, limiting their ability to fully capture the intricate temporal dynamics necessary for robust domain adaptation. In this work, we propose a novel framework leveraging multi-view contrastive learning to integrate temporal patterns, derivative-based dynamics, and frequency-domain features. Our method employs independent encoders and a hierarchical fusion mechanism to learn feature-invariant representations that are transferable across domains while preserving temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on diverse medical datasets, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and electromyography (EMG) demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in transfer learning tasks. By advancing the robustness and generalizability of machine learning models, our framework offers a practical pathway for deploying reliable AI systems in diverse healthcare settings.

Abstract: Inference accounts for the majority of latency and energy consumption in large language model (LLM) deployments, often exceeding 90% of total cost. While training-time efficiency has seen extensive progress, runtime optimization remains a key bottleneck, particularly under autoregressive decoding. Existing approaches -- such as pruning, quantization, early exits, and speculative decoding -- often require retraining, architectural changes, or disrupt decoding compatibility. We introduce QuickSilver, a modular, token-level framework that enables semantic adaptivity at inference time without altering model weights or structure. QuickSilver integrates four synergistic mechanisms:
  (i) Dynamic Token Halting, which halts computation for tokens with converged representations; (ii) KV Cache Skipping, which selectively suppresses memory writes to reduce attention overhead; and (iii) Contextual Token Fusion, which collapses redundant tokens into shared paths to shrink sequence length.
  Unlike speculative decoding or MoE routing, QuickSilver operates entirely on frozen, dense models and requires no auxiliary networks. Applied to GPT-2 and Llama-2 across WikiText-103 and C4, QuickSilver achieves up to 39.6% FLOP reduction with negligible perplexity degradation (<=0.2).

<title>Dehazing Light Microscopy Images with Guided Conditional Flow Matching: finding a sweet spot between fidelity and realism</title>

Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy is a major driver of scientific progress in the life sciences. Although high-end confocal microscopes are capable of filtering out-of-focus light, cheaper and more accessible microscopy modalities, such as widefield microscopy, can not, which consequently leads to hazy image data. Computational dehazing is trying to combine the best of both worlds, leading to cheap microscopy but crisp-looking images. The perception-distortion trade-off tells us that we can optimize either for data fidelity, e.g. low MSE or high PSNR, or for data realism, measured by perceptual metrics such as LPIPS or FID. Existing methods either prioritize fidelity at the expense of realism, or produce perceptually convincing results that lack quantitative accuracy. In this work, we propose HazeMatching, a novel iterative method for dehazing light microscopy images, which effectively balances these objectives. Our goal was to find a balanced trade-off between the fidelity of the dehazing results and the realism of individual predictions (samples). We achieve this by adapting the conditional flow matching framework by guiding the generative process with a hazy observation in the conditional velocity field. We evaluate HazeMatching on 5 datasets, covering both synthetic and real data, assessing both distortion and perceptual quality. Our method is compared against 7 baselines, achieving a consistent balance between fidelity and realism on average. Additionally, with calibration analysis, we show that HazeMatching produces well-calibrated predictions. Note that our method does not need an explicit degradation operator to exist, making it easily applicable on real microscopy data. All data used for training and evaluation and our code will be publicly available under a permissive license.

Abstract: We introduce HyperCLOVA X THINK, the first reasoning-focused large language model in the HyperCLOVA X family, pre-trained on roughly $6$ trillion high-quality Korean, and English tokens, augmented with targeted synthetic Korean data. It was implemented as a compute-memory-balanced Peri-LN Transformer scaled with $\mu$P, pre-trained through a three-stage curriculum that expands the context window to $128$K tokens, and post-trained via supervised fine-tuning with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards supports both detailed rationale and concise-answer modes. It delivers competitive performance against similarly sized models on Korea-focused benchmarks such as KMMLU, CSAT, KoBALT-700, HAERAE-1.0, and KoBigBench, while preserving robust bilingual consistency and translation quality. In addition, a vision-augmented variant matches or exceeds GPT-4.1 on the KCSAT STEM benchmark, all of which are achieved with substantially lower training compute than existing models of similar sizes. We also present a pruning and distillation technique that will soon be applied to HyperCLOVA X THINK for an open-source and business-friendly foundation model. Altogether, these capabilities position HyperCLOVA X THINK as a robust foundation for Korean AI innovation and a valuable resource for the global research community.

Abstract: We propose CLoVE (Clustering of Loss Vector Embeddings), a novel algorithm for Clustered Federated Learning (CFL). In CFL, clients are naturally grouped into clusters based on their data distribution. However, identifying these clusters is challenging, as client assignments are unknown. CLoVE utilizes client embeddings derived from model losses on client data, and leverages the insight that clients in the same cluster share similar loss values, while those in different clusters exhibit distinct loss patterns. Based on these embeddings, CLoVE is able to iteratively identify and separate clients from different clusters and optimize cluster-specific models through federated aggregation. Key advantages of CLoVE over existing CFL algorithms are (1) its simplicity, (2) its applicability to both supervised and unsupervised settings, and (3) the fact that it eliminates the need for near-optimal model initialization, which makes it more robust and better suited for real-world applications. We establish theoretical convergence bounds, showing that CLoVE can recover clusters accurately with high probability in a single round and converges exponentially fast to optimal models in a linear setting. Our comprehensive experiments comparing with a variety of both CFL and generic Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) algorithms on different types of datasets and an extensive array of non-IID settings demonstrate that CLoVE achieves highly accurate cluster recovery in just a few rounds of training, along with state-of-the-art model accuracy, across a variety of both supervised and unsupervised PFL tasks.

Abstract: The development of autonomous agents increasingly relies on Multimodal Language Models (MLMs) to perform tasks described in natural language with GUI environments, such as websites, desktop computers, or mobile phones. Existing benchmarks for MLM agents in interactive environments are limited by their focus on a single environment, lack of detailed and generalized evaluation methods, and the complexities of constructing tasks and evaluators. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Crab, the first agent benchmark framework designed to support cross-environment tasks, incorporating a graph-based fine-grained evaluation method and an efficient mechanism for task and evaluator construction. Our framework supports multiple devices and can be easily extended to any environment with a Python interface. Leveraging Crab, we developed a cross-platform Crab Benchmark-v0 comprising 120 tasks in computer desktop and mobile phone environments. We evaluated four advanced MLMs using different single and multi-agent system configurations on this benchmark. The experimental results demonstrate that the single agent with GPT-4o achieves the best completion ratio of 38.01%. All framework code, agent code, and task datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/camel-ai/crab.

Abstract: While there is a widespread belief that artificial general intelligence (AGI) -- or even superhuman AI -- is imminent, complex problems in expert domains are far from being solved. We argue that such problems require human-AI cooperation and that the current state of the art in generative AI is unable to play the role of a reliable partner due to a multitude of shortcomings, including difficulty to keep track of a complex solution artifact (e.g., a software program), limited support for versatile human preference expression and lack of adapting to human preference in an interactive setting. To address these challenges, we propose HAICo2, a novel human-AI co-construction framework. We take first steps towards a formalization of HAICo2 and discuss the difficult open research problems that it faces.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated human-like computer control capability. Despite their utility in advancing digital automation, a critical bottleneck persists: collecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for collecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation through executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or unable to guarantee data quality. Moreover, these methods suffer from limited data diversity and significant gaps between synthetic data and real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose OS-Genesis, a novel GUI data synthesis pipeline that reverses the conventional trajectory collection process. Instead of relying on pre-defined tasks, OS-Genesis enables agents first to perceive environments and perform step-wise interactions, then retrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level exploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with OS-Genesis significantly improves their performance on highly challenging online benchmarks. In-depth analysis further validates OS-Genesis's efficiency and its superior data quality and diversity compared to existing synthesis methods. Our codes, data, and checkpoints are available at https://qiushisun.github.io/OS-Genesis-Home/.

Abstract: Exploration is a cornerstone of reinforcement learning (RL). Intrinsic motivation attempts to decouple exploration from external, task-based rewards. However, established approaches to intrinsic motivation that follow general principles such as information gain, often only uncover low-level interactions. In contrast, children's play suggests that they engage in meaningful high-level behavior by imitating or interacting with their caregivers. Recent work has focused on using foundation models to inject these semantic biases into exploration. However, these methods often rely on unrealistic assumptions, such as language-embedded environments or access to high-level actions. We propose SEmaNtically Sensible ExploratIon (SENSEI), a framework to equip model-based RL agents with an intrinsic motivation for semantically meaningful behavior. SENSEI distills a reward signal of interestingness from Vision Language Model (VLM) annotations, enabling an agent to predict these rewards through a world model. Using model-based RL, SENSEI trains an exploration policy that jointly maximizes semantic rewards and uncertainty. We show that in both robotic and video game-like simulations SENSEI discovers a variety of meaningful behaviors from image observations and low-level actions. SENSEI provides a general tool for learning from foundation model feedback, a crucial research direction, as VLMs become more powerful.

Abstract: Recent advances demonstrate that increasing inference-time computation can significantly boost the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Although repeated sampling (i.e., generating multiple candidate outputs) is a highly effective strategy, it does not leverage external feedback signals for refinement, which are often available in tasks like coding. In this work, we propose Adaptive Branching Monte Carlo Tree Search (AB-MCTS), a novel inference-time framework that generalizes repeated sampling with principled multi-turn exploration and exploitation. At each node in the search tree, AB-MCTS dynamically decides whether to "go wider" by expanding new candidate responses or "go deeper" by revisiting existing ones based on external feedback signals. We evaluate our method on complex coding and engineering tasks using frontier models. Empirical results show that AB-MCTS consistently outperforms both repeated sampling and standard MCTS, underscoring the importance of combining the response diversity of LLMs with multi-turn solution refinement for effective inference-time scaling.

Abstract: In a conversational system, dynamically generating follow-up questions based on context can help users explore information and provide a better user experience. Humans are usually able to ask questions that involve some general life knowledge and demonstrate higher order cognitive skills. However, the questions generated by existing methods are often limited to shallow contextual questions that are uninspiring and have a large gap to the human level. In this paper, we propose a three-stage external knowledge-enhanced follow-up question generation method, which generates questions by identifying contextual topics, constructing a knowledge graph (KG) online, and finally combining these with a large language model to generate the final question. The model generates information-rich and exploratory follow-up questions by introducing external common sense knowledge and performing a knowledge fusion operation. Experiments show that compared to baseline models, our method generates questions that are more informative and closer to human questioning levels while maintaining contextual relevance.

Abstract: Modern general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) systems present an urgent risk management challenge, as their rapidly evolving capabilities and potential for catastrophic harm outpace our ability to reliably assess their risks. Current methods often rely on selective testing and undocumented assumptions about risk priorities, frequently failing to make a serious attempt at assessing the set of pathways through which AI systems pose direct or indirect risks to society and the biosphere. This paper introduces the probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) for AI framework, adapting established PRA techniques from high-reliability industries (e.g., nuclear power, aerospace) for the new challenges of advanced AI. The framework guides assessors in identifying potential risks, estimating likelihood and severity bands, and explicitly documenting evidence, underlying assumptions, and analyses at appropriate granularities. The framework's implementation tool synthesizes the results into a risk report card with aggregated risk estimates from all assessed risks. It introduces three methodological advances: (1) Aspect-oriented hazard analysis provides systematic hazard coverage guided by a first-principles taxonomy of AI system aspects (e.g. capabilities, domain knowledge, affordances); (2) Risk pathway modeling analyzes causal chains from system aspects to societal impacts using bidirectional analysis and incorporating prospective techniques; and (3) Uncertainty management employs scenario decomposition, reference scales, and explicit tracing protocols to structure credible projections with novelty or limited data. Additionally, the framework harmonizes diverse assessment methods by integrating evidence into comparable, quantified absolute risk estimates for lifecycle decisions. We have implemented this as a workbook tool for AI developers, evaluators, and regulators.

<title>Local Markov Equivalence and Local Causal Discovery for Identifying Controlled Direct Effects</title>

Abstract: Understanding and identifying controlled direct effects (CDEs) is crucial across numerous scientific domains, including public health. While existing methods can identify these effects from causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), the true underlying structure is often unknown in practice. Essential graphs, which represent a Markov equivalence class of DAGs characterized by the same set of $d$-separations, provide a more practical and realistic alternative. However, learning the full essential graph is computationally intensive and typically depends on strong, untestable assumptions. In this work, we characterize a local class of graphs, defined relative to a target variable, that share a specific subset of $d$-separations, and introduce a graphical representation of this class, called the local essential graph (LEG). We then present LocPC, a novel algorithm designed to recover the LEG from an observed distribution using only local conditional independence tests. Building on LocPC, we propose LocPC-CDE, an algorithm that discovers the portion of the LEG that is both sufficient and necessary to identify a CDE, bypassing the need of retrieving the full essential graph. Compared to global methods, our algorithms require less conditional independence tests and operate under weaker assumptions while maintaining theoretical guarantees. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulation studies.

Abstract: Despite AI's impressive achievements, including recent advances in generative and large language models, there remains a significant gap in the ability of AI systems to handle uncertainty and generalize beyond their training data. AI models consistently fail to make robust enough predictions when facing unfamiliar or adversarial data. Traditional machine learning approaches struggle to address this issue, due to an overemphasis on data fitting, while current uncertainty quantification approaches suffer from serious limitations. This position paper posits a paradigm shift towards epistemic artificial intelligence, emphasizing the need for models to learn from what they know while at the same time acknowledging their ignorance, using the mathematics of second-order uncertainty measures. This approach, which leverages the expressive power of such measures to efficiently manage uncertainty, offers an effective way to improve the resilience and robustness of AI systems, allowing them to better handle unpredictable real-world environments.

Abstract: AI-based peer review systems tend to produce shallow and overpraising suggestions compared to human feedback. Here, we evaluate how well a reasoning LLM trained with multi-objective reinforcement learning (REMOR) can overcome these limitations. We start by designing a multi-aspect reward function that aligns with human evaluation of reviews. The aspects are related to the review itself (e.g., criticisms, novelty) and the relationship between the review and the manuscript (i.e., relevance). First, we perform supervised fine-tuning of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B using LoRA on PeerRT, a new dataset of high-quality top AI conference reviews enriched with reasoning traces. We then apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train two models: REMOR-H (with the human-aligned reward) and REMOR-U (with a uniform reward). Interestingly, the human-aligned reward penalizes aspects typically associated with strong reviews, leading REMOR-U to produce qualitatively more substantive feedback. Our results show that REMOR-U and REMOR-H achieve more than twice the average rewards of human reviews, non-reasoning state-of-the-art agentic multi-modal AI review systems, and general commercial LLM baselines. We found that while the best AI and human reviews are comparable in quality, REMOR avoids the long tail of low-quality human reviews. We discuss how reasoning is key to achieving these improvements and release the Human-aligned Peer Review Reward (HPRR) function, the Peer Review Reasoning-enriched Traces (PeerRT) dataset, and the REMOR models, which we believe can help spur progress in the area.

<title>StarFT: Robust Fine-tuning of Zero-shot Models via Spuriosity Alignment</title>

Abstract: Learning robust representations from data often requires scale, which has led to the success of recent zero-shot models such as CLIP. However, the obtained robustness can easily be deteriorated when these models are fine-tuned on other downstream tasks (e.g., of smaller scales). Previous works often interpret this phenomenon in the context of domain shift, developing fine-tuning methods that aim to preserve the original domain as much as possible. However, in a different context, fine-tuned models with limited data are also prone to learning features that are spurious to humans, such as background or texture. In this paper, we propose StarFT (Spurious Textual Alignment Regularization), a novel framework for fine-tuning zero-shot models to enhance robustness by preventing them from learning spuriosity. We introduce a regularization that aligns the output distribution for spuriosity-injected labels with the original zero-shot model, ensuring that the model is not induced to extract irrelevant features further from these descriptions. We leverage recent language models to get such spuriosity-injected labels by generating alternative textual descriptions that highlight potentially confounding features. Extensive experiments validate the robust generalization of StarFT and its emerging properties: zero-shot group robustness and improved zero-shot classification. Notably, StarFT boosts both worst-group and average accuracy by 14.30% and 3.02%, respectively, in the Waterbirds group shift scenario, where other robust fine-tuning baselines show even degraded performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have extended their impact beyond Natural Language Processing, substantially fostering the development of interdisciplinary research. Recently, various LLM-based agents have been developed to assist scientific discovery progress across multiple aspects and domains. Among these, computer-using agents, capable of interacting with operating systems as humans do, are paving the way to automated scientific problem-solving and addressing routines in researchers' workflows. Recognizing the transformative potential of these agents, we introduce ScienceBoard, which encompasses two complementary contributions: (i) a realistic, multi-domain environment featuring dynamic and visually rich scientific workflows with integrated professional software, where agents can autonomously interact via different interfaces to accelerate complex research tasks and experiments; and (ii) a challenging benchmark of 169 high-quality, rigorously validated real-world tasks curated by humans, spanning scientific-discovery workflows in domains such as biochemistry, astronomy, and geoinformatics. Extensive evaluations of agents with state-of-the-art backbones (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3.7, UI-TARS) show that, despite some promising results, they still fall short of reliably assisting scientists in complex workflows, achieving only a 15% overall success rate. In-depth analysis further provides valuable insights for addressing current agent limitations and more effective design principles, paving the way to build more capable agents for scientific discovery. Our code, environment, and benchmark are at https://qiushisun.github.io/ScienceBoard-Home/.

Abstract: Contemporary businesses operate in dynamic environments requiring rapid adaptation to achieve goals and maintain competitiveness. Existing data platforms often fall short by emphasizing tools over alignment with business needs, resulting in inefficiencies and delays. To address this gap, I propose the Business Semantics Centric, AI Agents Assisted Data System (BSDS), a holistic system that integrates architecture, workflows, and team organization to ensure data systems are tailored to business priorities rather than dictated by technical constraints. BSDS redefines data systems as dynamic enablers of business success, transforming them from passive tools into active drivers of organizational growth. BSDS has a modular architecture that comprises curated data linked to business entities, a knowledge base for context-aware AI agents, and efficient data pipelines. AI agents play a pivotal role in assisting with data access and system management, reducing human effort, and improving scalability. Complementing this architecture, BSDS incorporates workflows optimized for both exploratory data analysis and production requirements, balancing speed of delivery with quality assurance. A key innovation of BSDS is its incorporation of the human factor. By aligning data team expertise with business semantics, BSDS bridges the gap between technical capabilities and business needs. Validated through real-world implementation, BSDS accelerates time-to-market for data-driven initiatives, enhances cross-functional collaboration, and provides a scalable blueprint for businesses of all sizes. Future research can build on BSDS to explore optimization strategies using complex systems and adaptive network theories, as well as developing autonomous data systems leveraging AI agents.

Abstract: Peer review, the bedrock of scientific advancement in machine learning (ML), is strained by a crisis of scale. Exponential growth in manuscript submissions to premier ML venues such as NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR is outpacing the finite capacity of qualified reviewers, leading to concerns about review quality, consistency, and reviewer fatigue. This position paper argues that AI-assisted peer review must become an urgent research and infrastructure priority. We advocate for a comprehensive AI-augmented ecosystem, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) not as replacements for human judgment, but as sophisticated collaborators for authors, reviewers, and Area Chairs (ACs). We propose specific roles for AI in enhancing factual verification, guiding reviewer performance, assisting authors in quality improvement, and supporting ACs in decision-making. Crucially, we contend that the development of such systems hinges on access to more granular, structured, and ethically-sourced peer review process data. We outline a research agenda, including illustrative experiments, to develop and validate these AI assistants, and discuss significant technical and ethical challenges. We call upon the ML community to proactively build this AI-assisted future, ensuring the continued integrity and scalability of scientific validation, while maintaining high standards of peer review.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on tasks that combine visual reasoning with subject-specific background knowledge in the German language. In contrast to widely used English-language benchmarks that often rely on artificially difficult or decontextualized problems, this dataset draws from real middle school curricula across nine domains including mathematics, history, biology, and religion. The benchmark includes over 2,000 open-ended questions grounded in 486 images, ensuring that models must integrate visual interpretation with factual reasoning rather than rely on superficial textual cues. We evaluate thirteen state-of-the-art open-weight VLMs across multiple dimensions, including domain-specific accuracy and performance on adversarial crafted questions. Our findings reveal that even the strongest models achieve less than 45% overall accuracy, with particularly poor performance in music, mathematics, and adversarial settings. Furthermore, the results indicate significant discrepancies between success on popular benchmarks and real-world multimodal understanding. We conclude that middle school-level tasks offer a meaningful and underutilized avenue for stress-testing VLMs, especially in non-English contexts. The dataset and evaluation protocol serve as a rigorous testbed to better understand and improve the visual and linguistic reasoning capabilities of future AI systems.

<title>The SWE-Bench Illusion: When State-of-the-Art LLMs Remember Instead of Reason</title>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly capable and widely adopted, benchmarks play a central role in assessing their practical utility. For example, SWE-Bench Verified has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating LLMs' software engineering abilities, particularly their aptitude for resolving real-world GitHub issues. Recent LLMs show impressive performance on SWE-Bench, leading to optimism about their capacity for complex coding tasks. However, current evaluation protocols may overstate these models' true capabilities. It is crucial to distinguish LLMs' generalizable problem-solving ability and other learned artifacts. In this work, we introduce two diagnostic tasks: file path identification from issue descriptions alone, and ground truth function reproduction with only the current file context and issue description to probe models' underlying knowledge. We present empirical evidence that performance gains on SWE-Bench-Verified may be partially driven by memorization rather than genuine problem-solving. We show that state-of-the-art models achieve up to 76% accuracy in identifying buggy file paths using only issue descriptions, without access to repository structure. This performance is merely up to 53% on tasks from repositories not included in SWE-Bench, pointing to possible data contamination or memorization. A similar pattern is also observed for the function reproduction task, where the verbatim similarity is much higher on SWE-Bench-Verified than on other similar coding benchmarks. These findings raise concerns about the validity of existing results and underscore the need for more robust, contamination-resistant benchmarks to reliably evaluate LLMs' coding abilities.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly simulate human cognition and behavior, researchers have begun to investigate their psychological properties. Yet, what it means for such models to flourish, a core construct in human well-being, remains unexplored. This paper introduces the concept of machine flourishing and proposes the PAPERS framework, a six-dimensional model derived from thematic analyses of state-of-the-art LLM responses. In Study 1, eleven LLMs were prompted to describe what it means to flourish as both non-sentient and sentient systems. Thematic analysis revealed six recurring themes: Purposeful Contribution, Adaptive Growth, Positive Relationality, Ethical Integrity, Robust Functionality, and, uniquely for sentient systems, Self-Actualized Autonomy. Study 2 examined how LLMs prioritize these themes through repeated rankings. Results revealed consistent value structures across trials, with Ethical Integrity and Purposeful Contribution emerging as top priorities. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering analyses further uncovered two distinct value profiles: human-centric models emphasizing ethical and relational dimensions, and utility-driven models prioritizing performance and scalability. The PAPERS framework bridges insights from human flourishing and human-computer interaction, offering a conceptual foundation for understanding artificial intelligence (AI) well-being in non-sentient and potentially sentient systems. Our findings underscore the importance of developing psychologically valid, AI-specific models of flourishing that account for both human-aligned goals and system-specific priorities. As AI systems become more autonomous and socially embedded, machine flourishing offers a timely and critical lens for guiding responsible AI design and ethical alignment.

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in research on deep interpretable neural networks with decision trees as one of the most commonly incorporated tools. There are at least three advantages of using decision trees over logistic regression classification models: they are easy to interpret since they are based on binary decisions, they can make decisions faster, and they provide a hierarchy of classes. However, one of the well-known drawbacks of decision trees, as compared to decision graphs, is that decision trees cannot reuse the decision nodes. Nevertheless, decision graphs were not commonly used in deep learning due to the lack of efficient gradient-based training techniques. In this paper, we fill this gap and provide a general paradigm based on Markov processes, which allows for efficient training of the special type of decision graphs, which we call Self-Organizing Neural Graphs (SONG). We provide an extensive theoretical study of SONG, complemented by experiments conducted on Letter, Connect4, MNIST, CIFAR, and TinyImageNet datasets, showing that our method performs on par or better than existing decision models.

Abstract: Two CNF formulas are called ucp-equivalent, if they behave in the same way with respect to the unit clause propagation (UCP). A formula is called ucp-irredundant, if removing any clause leads to a formula which is not ucp-equivalent to the original one. As a consequence of known results, the ratio of the size of a ucp-irredundant formula and the size of a smallest ucp-equivalent formula is at most $n^2$, where $n$ is the number of the variables. We demonstrate an example of a ucp-irredundant formula for a symmetric definite Horn function which is larger than a smallest ucp-equivalent formula by a factor $\Omega(n/\ln n)$. Consequently, a general upper bound on the above ratio cannot be smaller than this.

Abstract: Employers are adopting algorithmic hiring technology throughout the recruitment pipeline. Algorithmic fairness is especially applicable in this domain due to its high stakes and structural inequalities. Unfortunately, most work in this space provides partial treatment, often constrained by two competing narratives, optimistically focused on replacing biased recruiter decisions or pessimistically pointing to the automation of discrimination. Whether, and more importantly what types of, algorithmic hiring can be less biased and more beneficial to society than low-tech alternatives currently remains unanswered, to the detriment of trustworthiness. This multidisciplinary survey caters to practitioners and researchers with a balanced and integrated coverage of systems, biases, measures, mitigation strategies, datasets, and legal aspects of algorithmic hiring and fairness. Our work supports a contextualized understanding and governance of this technology by highlighting current opportunities and limitations, providing recommendations for future work to ensure shared benefits for all stakeholders.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as the state-of-the-art approach for learning from decentralized data in privacy-constrained scenarios.However, system and statistical challenges hinder its real-world applicability, requiring efficient learning from edge devices and robustness to data heterogeneity. Despite significant research efforts, existing approaches often degrade severely due to the joint effect of heterogeneity and partial client participation. In particular, while momentum appears as a promising approach for overcoming statistical heterogeneity, in current approaches its update is biased towards the most recently sampled clients. As we show in this work, this is the reason why it fails to outperform FedAvg, preventing its effective use in real-world large-scale scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel Generalized Heavy-Ball Momentum (GHBM) and theoretically prove it enables convergence under unbounded data heterogeneity in cyclic partial participation, thereby advancing the understanding of momentum's effectiveness in FL. We then introduce adaptive and communication-efficient variants of GHBM that match the communication complexity of FedAvg in settings where clients can be stateful. Extensive experiments on vision and language tasks confirm our theoretical findings, demonstrating that GHBM substantially improves state-of-the-art performance under random uniform client sampling, particularly in large-scale settings with high data heterogeneity and low client participation. Code is available at https://rickzack.github.io/GHBM.

Abstract: Recent trends like the Internet of Things (IoT) suggest a vision of dense and multi-scale deployments of computing devices in nearly all kinds of environments. A prominent engineering challenge revolves around programming the collective adaptive behaviour of such computational ecosystems. This requires abstractions able to capture concepts like ensembles (dynamic groups of cooperating devices) and collective tasks (joint activities carried out by ensembles). In this work, we consider collections of devices interacting with neighbours and that execute in nearly-synchronised sense-compute-interact rounds, where the computation is given by a single program mapping sensing values and incoming messages to output and outcoming messages. To support programming whole computational collectives, we propose the abstraction of a distributed collective process, which can be used to define at once the ensemble formation logic and its collective task. We formalise the abstraction in the eXchange Calculus (XC), a core functional language based on neighbouring values (maps from neighbours to values) where state and interaction is handled through a single primitive, exchange, and provide a corresponding implementation in the FCPP language. Then, we exercise distributed collective processes using two case studies: multi-hop message propagation and distributed monitoring of spatial properties. Finally, we discuss the features of the abstraction and its suitability for different kinds of distributed computing applications.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought prompting (CoT) has the potential to improve the explainability of language model reasoning. But CoT can also systematically misrepresent the factors influencing models' behavior -- for example, rationalizing answers in line with a user's opinion.
  We first create a new dataset of 9 different biases that affect GPT-3.5-Turbo and Llama-8b models. These consist of spurious-few-shot patterns, post hoc rationalization, and sycophantic settings. Models switch to the answer implied by the bias, without mentioning the effect of the bias in the CoT.
  To mitigate this biased reasoning problem, we introduce bias-augmented consistency training (BCT), an unsupervised fine-tuning scheme that trains models to give consistent reasoning across prompts with and without biasing features. We construct a suite testing nine forms of biased reasoning on seven question-answering tasks, and find that applying BCT to GPT-3.5-Turbo with one bias reduces the rate of biased reasoning by 86\% on held-out tasks. Moreover, this model generalizes to other forms of bias, reducing biased reasoning on held-out biases by an average of 37\%. As BCT generalizes to held-out biases and does not require gold labels, this method may hold promise for reducing biased reasoning from as-of-yet unknown biases and on tasks where ground truth reasoning is unavailable.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of computer vision systems has underscored their susceptibility to adversarial attacks, particularly adversarial patch attacks on object detectors. This study evaluates defense mechanisms for the YOLOv5 model against such attacks. Optimized adversarial patches were generated and placed in sensitive image regions, by applying EigenCAM and grid search to determine optimal placement. We tested several defenses, including Segment and Complete (SAC), Inpainting, and Latent Diffusion Models. Our pipeline comprises three main stages: patch application, object detection, and defense analysis. Results indicate that adversarial patches reduce average detection confidence by 22.06\%. Defenses restored confidence levels by 3.45\% (SAC), 5.05\% (Inpainting), and significantly improved them by 26.61\%, which even exceeds the original accuracy levels, when using the Latent Diffusion Model, highlighting its superior effectiveness in mitigating the effects of adversarial patches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed AI but often struggle with tasks that require domain-specific reasoning and logical alignment. Traditional fine-tuning methods do not leverage the vast amount of symbolic domain-knowledge available to us via symbolic reasoning tools (e.g., provers), and are further limited by sparse rewards and unreliable reward models.
  We introduce Reinforcement Learning via Symbolic Feedback (RLSF), a novel fine-tuning paradigm where symbolic reasoning tools (e.g., solvers, provers, and algebra systems) provide fine-grained feedback to LLMs. RLSF uses poly-sized certificates (e.g., proofs) generated by symbolic tools to identify and correct errors in model outputs, offering token-level guidance without requiring differentiable reasoning systems. This paradigm bridges the gap between symbolic reasoning and LLM fine-tuning, enabling precise alignment with domain-specific constraints while addressing key limitations of traditional reward signals.
  Via extensive evaluations, we show that our RLSF-based fine-tuning of LLMs outperforms traditional approaches on five different applications (that have some associated logical or domain constraints), namely, program synthesis from natural language pseudo-code to programming language, three chemistry tasks, and solving the Game of 24. A key takeaway is that fine-tuning via RLSF enables relatively smaller LLMs to significantly outperform closed-source models that are orders of magnitude larger.

Abstract: Testing is essential to modern software engineering for building reliable software. Given the high costs of manually creating test cases, automated test case generation, particularly methods utilizing large language models, has become increasingly popular. These neural approaches generate semantically meaningful tests that are more maintainable compared with traditional automatic testing methods like fuzzing. However, the diversity and volume of unit tests in current datasets are limited, especially for newer but important languages. In this paper, we present a novel data augmentation technique, FuzzAug, that introduces the benefits of fuzzing to large language models by introducing valid testing semantics and providing diverse coverage-guided inputs. Doubling the size of training datasets, FuzzAug improves the performance from the baselines significantly. This technique demonstrates the potential of introducing prior knowledge from dynamic software analysis to improve neural test generation, offering significant enhancements in neural test generation.

Abstract: While high data quality (DQ) is critical for analytics, compliance, and AI performance, data quality management (DQM) remains a complex, resource-intensive, and often manual process. This study investigates the extent to which existing tools support AI-augmented data quality management (DQM) in data warehouse environments. To this end, we conduct a systematic review of 151 DQ tools to evaluate their automation capabilities, particularly in detecting and recommending DQ rules in data warehouses -- a key component of modern data ecosystems. Using a multi-phase screening process based on functionality, trialability, regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR), and architectural compatibility with data warehouses, only 10 tools met the criteria for AI-augmented DQM. The analysis reveals that most tools emphasize data cleansing and preparation for AI, rather than leveraging AI to improve DQ itself. Although metadata- and ML-based rule detection techniques are present, features such as SQL-based rule specification, reconciliation logic, and explainability of AI-driven recommendations remain scarce. This study offers practical guidance for tool selection and outlines critical design requirements for next-generation AI-driven DQ solutions -- advocating a paradigm shift from ``data quality for AI'' to ``AI for data quality management''.

Abstract: In recent years, generative artificial intelligence has achieved significant advancements in the field of image generation, spawning a variety of applications. However, video generation still faces considerable challenges in various aspects, such as controllability, video length, and richness of details, which hinder the application and popularization of this technology. In this work, we propose a controllable video generation framework, dubbed MimicMotion, which can generate high-quality videos of arbitrary length mimicking specific motion guidance. Compared with previous methods, our approach has several highlights. Firstly, we introduce confidence-aware pose guidance that ensures high frame quality and temporal smoothness. Secondly, we introduce regional loss amplification based on pose confidence, which significantly reduces image distortion. Lastly, for generating long and smooth videos, we propose a progressive latent fusion strategy. By this means, we can produce videos of arbitrary length with acceptable resource consumption. With extensive experiments and user studies, MimicMotion demonstrates significant improvements over previous approaches in various aspects. Detailed results and comparisons are available on our project page: https://tencent.github.io/MimicMotion .

<title>CAPM: Fast and Robust Verification on Maxpool-based CNN via Dual Network</title>

Abstract: This study uses CAPM (Convex Adversarial Polytope for Maxpool-based CNN) to improve the verified bound for general purpose maxpool-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) under bounded norm adversarial perturbations. The maxpool function is decomposed as a series of ReLU functions to extend the convex relaxation technique to maxpool functions, by which the verified bound can be efficiently computed through a dual network. The experimental results demonstrate that this technique allows the state-of-the-art verification precision for maxpool-based CNNs and involves a much lower computational cost than current verification methods, such as DeepZ, DeepPoly and PRIMA. This method is also applicable to large-scale CNNs, which previous studies show to be often computationally prohibitively expensive. Under certain circumstances, CAPM is 40-times, 20-times or twice as fast and give a significantly higher verification bound (CAPM 98% vs. PRIMA 76%/DeepPoly 73%/DeepZ 8%) as compared to PRIMA/DeepPoly/DeepZ. Furthermore, we additionally present the time complexity of our algorithm as $O(W^2NK)$, where $W$ is the maximum width of the neural network, $N$ is the number of neurons, and $K$ is the size of the maxpool layer's kernel.

<title>Mitigating Metropolitan Carbon Emissions with Dynamic Eco-driving at Scale</title>

Abstract: The sheer scale and diversity of transportation make it a formidable sector to decarbonize. Here, we consider an emerging opportunity to reduce carbon emissions: the growing adoption of semi-autonomous vehicles, which can be programmed to mitigate stop-and-go traffic through intelligent speed commands and, thus, reduce emissions. But would such dynamic eco-driving move the needle on climate change? A comprehensive impact analysis has been out of reach due to the vast array of traffic scenarios and the complexity of vehicle emissions. We address this challenge with large-scale scenario modeling efforts and by using multi-task deep reinforcement learning with a carefully designed network decomposition strategy. We perform an in-depth prospective impact assessment of dynamic eco-driving at 6,011 signalized intersections across three major US metropolitan cities, simulating a million traffic scenarios. Overall, we find that vehicle trajectories optimized for emissions can cut city-wide intersection carbon emissions by 11-22%, without harming throughput or safety, and with reasonable assumptions, equivalent to the national emissions of Israel and Nigeria, respectively. We find that 10% eco-driving adoption yields 25%-50% of the total reduction, and nearly 70% of the benefits come from 20% of intersections, suggesting near-term implementation pathways. However, the composition of this high-impact subset of intersections varies considerably across different adoption levels, with minimal overlap, calling for careful strategic planning for eco-driving deployments. Moreover, the impact of eco-driving, when considered jointly with projections of vehicle electrification and hybrid vehicle adoption remains significant. More broadly, this work paves the way for large-scale analysis of traffic externalities, such as time, safety, and air quality, and the potential impact of solution strategies.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in various domains, such as business intelligence and financial forecasting. Large language models (LLMs) have become a popular paradigm for sentiment analysis, leveraging multi-task learning to address specific tasks concurrently. However, LLMs with fine-tuning for sentiment analysis often underperforms due to the inherent challenges in managing diverse task complexities. Moreover, constant-weight approaches in multi-task learning struggle to adapt to variations in data characteristics, further complicating model effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-task learning framework with a dynamic adaptive optimization (DAO) module. This module is designed as a plug-and-play component that can be seamlessly integrated into existing models, providing an effective and flexible solution for multi-task learning. The key component of the DAO module is dynamic adaptive loss, which dynamically adjusts the weights assigned to different tasks based on their relative importance and data characteristics during training. Sentiment analyses on a standard and customized financial text dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior performance. Specifically, this work improves the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Accuracy (ACC) by 15.58% and 1.24% respectively, compared with previous work.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of the EUR/USD exchange rate is crucial for investors, businesses, and policymakers. This paper proposes a novel framework, IUS, that integrates unstructured textual data from news and analysis with structured data on exchange rates and financial indicators to enhance exchange rate prediction. The IUS framework employs large language models for sentiment polarity scoring and exchange rate movement classification of texts. These textual features are combined with quantitative features and input into a Causality-Driven Feature Generator. An Optuna-optimized Bi-LSTM model is then used to forecast the EUR/USD exchange rate. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms benchmark models, reducing MAE by 10.69% and RMSE by 9.56% compared to the best performing baseline. Results also show the benefits of data fusion, with the combination of unstructured and structured data yielding higher accuracy than structured data alone. Furthermore, feature selection using the top 12 important quantitative features combined with the textual features proves most effective. The proposed IUS framework and Optuna-Bi-LSTM model provide a powerful new approach for exchange rate forecasting through multi-source data integration.

Abstract: Linear RNN architectures, like Mamba, can be competitive with Transformer models in language modeling while having advantageous deployment characteristics. Given the focus on training large-scale Transformer models, we consider the challenge of converting these pretrained models for deployment. We demonstrate that it is feasible to distill large Transformers into linear RNNs by reusing the linear projection weights from attention layers with academic GPU resources. The resulting hybrid model, which incorporates a quarter of the attention layers, achieves performance comparable to the original Transformer in chat benchmarks and outperforms open-source hybrid Mamba models trained from scratch with trillions of tokens in both chat benchmarks and general benchmarks. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware speculative decoding algorithm that accelerates the inference speed of Mamba and hybrid models. Overall we show how, with limited computation resources, we can remove many of the original attention layers and generate from the resulting model more efficiently. Our top-performing model, distilled from Llama3-8B-Instruct, achieves a 29.61 length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2 against GPT-4 and 7.35 on MT-Bench, surpassing the best 8B scale instruction-tuned linear RNN model. We also find that the distilled model has natural length extrapolation, showing almost perfect accuracy in the needle-in-a-haystack test at 20x the distillation length. Code and pre-trained checkpoints are open-sourced at https://github.com/jxiw/MambaInLlama and https://github.com/itsdaniele/speculative_mamba.

<title>LRP4RAG: Detecting Hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Layer-wise Relevance Propagation</title>

arXiv:2408.15533v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a primary technique for mitigating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, incomplete knowledge extraction and insufficient understanding can still mislead LLMs to produce irrelevant or even contradictory responses, which means hallucinations persist in RAG. In this paper, we propose LRP4RAG, a method based on the Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) algorithm for detecting hallucinations in RAG. Specifically, we first utilize LRP to compute the relevance between the input and output of the RAG generator. We then apply further extraction and resampling to the relevance matrix. The processed relevance data are input into multiple classifiers to determine whether the output contains hallucinations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that LRP has been used for detecting RAG hallucinations, and extensive experiments demonstrate that LRP4RAG outperforms existing baselines.

arXiv:2408.15969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine stability properties of primal-dual gradient flow dynamics for composite convex optimization problems with multiple, possibly nonsmooth, terms in the objective function under the generalized consensus constraint. The proposed dynamics are based on the proximal augmented Lagrangian and they provide a viable alternative to ADMM which faces significant challenges from both analysis and implementation viewpoints in large-scale multi-block scenarios. In contrast to customized algorithms with individualized convergence guarantees, we develop a systematic approach for solving a broad class of challenging composite optimization problems. We leverage various structural properties to establish global (exponential) convergence guarantees for the proposed dynamics. Our assumptions are much weaker than those required to prove (exponential) stability of primal-dual dynamics as well as (linear) convergence of discrete-time methods such as standard two-block and multi-block ADMM and EXTRA algorithms. Finally, we show necessity of some of our structural assumptions for exponential stability and provide computational experiments to demonstrate the convenience of the proposed approach for parallel and distributed computing applications.

<title>Testing Causal Models with Hidden Variables in Polynomial Delay via Conditional Independencies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2409.14593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Testing a hypothesized causal model against observational data is a key prerequisite for many causal inference tasks. A natural approach is to test whether the conditional independence relations (CIs) assumed in the model hold in the data. While a model can assume exponentially many CIs (with respect to the number of variables), testing all of them is both impractical and unnecessary. Causal graphs, which encode these CIs in polynomial space, give rise to local Markov properties that enable model testing with a significantly smaller subset of CIs. Model testing based on local properties requires an algorithm to list the relevant CIs. However, existing algorithms for realistic settings with hidden variables and non-parametric distributions can take exponential time to produce even a single CI constraint. In this paper, we introduce the c-component local Markov property (C-LMP) for causal graphs with hidden variables. Since C-LMP can still invoke an exponential number of CIs, we develop a polynomial delay algorithm to list these CIs in poly-time intervals. To our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that enables poly-delay testing of CIs in causal graphs with hidden variables against arbitrary data distributions. Experiments on real-world and synthetic data demonstrate the practicality of our algorithm.

Abstract: A key challenge in Domain Generalization (DG) is preventing overfitting to source domains, which can be mitigated by finding flatter minima in the loss landscape. In this work, we propose Quantization-aware Training for Domain Generalization (QT-DoG) and demonstrate that weight quantization effectively leads to flatter minima in the loss landscape, thereby enhancing domain generalization. Unlike traditional quantization methods focused on model compression, QT-DoG exploits quantization as an implicit regularizer by inducing noise in model weights, guiding the optimization process toward flatter minima that are less sensitive to perturbations and overfitting. We provide both an analytical perspective and empirical evidence demonstrating that quantization inherently encourages flatter minima, leading to better generalization across domains. Moreover, with the benefit of reducing the model size through quantization, we demonstrate that an ensemble of multiple quantized models further yields superior accuracy than the state-of-the-art DG approaches with no computational or memory overheads. Code is released at: https://saqibjaved1.github.io/QT_DoG/.

arXiv:2410.10926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instruction tuning is a crucial step in improving the responsiveness of pretrained large language models (LLMs) to human instructions. Federated learning (FL) helps to exploit the use of vast private instruction data from clients, becoming popular for LLM tuning by improving data diversity. Existing federated tuning simply consumes all local data, causing excessive computational overhead and overfitting to local data, while centralized data-efficient solutions are not suitable for FL due to privacy concerns. This work presents FedHDS, a federated data-efficient instruction tuning approach, which tunes LLMs with a representative subset of edge-side data. It reduces the data redundancy at both intra- and inter-client levels without sharing raw data. Experiments with various LLMs, datasets and partitions show that FedHDS improves Rouge-L on unseen tasks by an average of 10.72% over the SOTA full-data federated instruction tuning methods, while using less than 1.5% of the data samples, improving training efficiency by up to tens of times.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis has become increasingly important for assessing public opinion and informing decision-making. Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized this field by capturing nuanced language patterns. However, adapting LLMs to domain-specific sentiment analysis tasks remains challenging due to computational constraints and the need for optimal fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Dynamic Adaptive Rank Space Exploration (DARSE) framework for efficient and effective sentiment analysis using LLMs. DARSE consists of a coarse-grained greedy algorithm to identify the optimal rank range, a fine-grained exploration algorithm to refine rank selection, and a dynamic rank allocation method to determine the optimal rank combination for each LLM layer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DARSE significantly improves sentiment analysis accuracy, achieving a 15.1% improvement in MSE and a 4.3% improvement in accuracy compared to previous work. Our framework strikes a balance between computational efficiency and model performance, making it a promising approach for sentiment analysis with LLMs.

Abstract: We study Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning (MCPP) on a 4-neighbor 2D grid G, which aims to compute paths for multiple robots to cover all cells of G. Traditional approaches are limited as they first compute coverage trees on a quadrant coarsened grid H and then employ the Spanning Tree Coverage (STC) paradigm to generate paths on G, making them inapplicable to grids with partially obstructed 2x2 blocks. To address this limitation, we reformulate the problem directly on G, revolutionizing grid-based MCPP solving and establishing new NP-hardness results. We introduce Extended-STC (ESTC), a novel paradigm that extends STC to ensure complete coverage with bounded suboptimality, even when H includes partially obstructed blocks. Furthermore, we present LS-MCPP, a new algorithmic framework that integrates ESTC with three novel types of neighborhood operators within a local search strategy to optimize coverage paths directly on G. Unlike prior grid-based MCPP work, our approach also incorporates a versatile post-processing procedure that applies Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) techniques to MCPP for the first time, enabling a fusion of these two important fields in multi-robot coordination. This procedure effectively resolves inter-robot conflicts and accommodates turning costs by solving a MAPF variant, making our MCPP solutions more practical for real-world applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves solution quality and efficiency, managing up to 100 robots on grids as large as 256x256 within minutes of runtime. Validation with physical robots confirms the feasibility of our solutions under real-world conditions.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach for EUR/USD exchange rate forecasting that integrates deep learning, textual analysis, and particle swarm optimization (PSO). By incorporating online news and analysis texts as qualitative data, the proposed PSO-LSTM model demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional econometric and machine learning models. The research employs advanced text mining techniques, including sentiment analysis using the RoBERTa-Large model and topic modeling with LDA. Empirical findings underscore the significant advantage of incorporating textual data, with the PSO-LSTM model outperforming benchmark models such as SVM, SVR, ARIMA, and GARCH. Ablation experiments reveal the contribution of each textual data category to the overall forecasting performance. The study highlights the transformative potential of artificial intelligence in finance and paves the way for future research in real-time forecasting and the integration of alternative data sources.

<title>KNN-MMD: Cross Domain Wireless Sensing via Local Distribution Alignment</title>

Abstract: Wireless sensing has recently found widespread applications in diverse environments, including homes, offices, and public spaces. By analyzing patterns in channel state information (CSI), it is possible to infer human actions for tasks such as person identification, gesture recognition, and fall detection. However, CSI is highly sensitive to environmental changes, where even minor alterations can significantly distort the CSI patterns. This sensitivity often leads to performance degradation or outright failure when applying wireless sensing models trained in one environment to another. To address this challenge, Domain Alignment (DAL) has been widely adopted for cross-domain classification tasks, as it focuses on aligning the global distributions of the source and target domains in feature space. Despite its popularity, DAL often neglects inter-category relationships, which can lead to misalignment between categories across domains, even when global alignment is achieved. To overcome these limitations, we propose K-Nearest Neighbors Maximum Mean Discrepancy (KNN-MMD), a novel few-shot method for cross-domain wireless sensing. Our approach begins by constructing a help set using KNN from the target domain, enabling local alignment between the source and target domains within each category using MMD. Additionally, we address a key instability issue commonly observed in cross-domain methods, where model performance fluctuates sharply between epochs. Further, most existing methods struggle to determine an optimal stopping point during training due to the absence of labeled data from the target domain. Our method resolves this by excluding the support set from the target domain during training and employing it as a validation set to determine the stopping criterion.The dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/RS2002/KNN-MMD .

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has gained prominence through low-rank adaptation methods like LoRA. In this paper, we focus on sparsity-based PEFT (SPEFT), which introduces trainable sparse adaptations to the weight matrices in the model, offering greater flexibility in selecting fine-tuned parameters compared to low-rank methods. We conduct the first systematic evaluation of salience metrics for SPEFT, inspired by zero-cost NAS proxies, and identify simple gradient-based metrics is reliable, and results are on par with the best alternatives, offering both computational efficiency and robust performance. Additionally, we compare static and dynamic masking strategies, finding that static masking, which predetermines non-zero entries before training, delivers efficiency without sacrificing performance, while dynamic masking offers no substantial benefits. Across NLP tasks, a simple gradient-based, static SPEFT consistently outperforms other fine-tuning methods for LLMs, providing a simple yet effective baseline for SPEFT. Our work challenges the notion that complexity is necessary for effective PEFT, while our open-source framework establishes a reproducible benchmark for future research, which is available at [https://github.com/0-ml/speft].

Abstract: Training transformer-based encoder-decoder models for long document summarization poses a significant challenge due to the quadratic memory consumption during training. Several approaches have been proposed to extend the input length at test time, but training with these approaches is still difficult, requiring truncation of input documents and causing a mismatch between training and test conditions. In this work, we propose CachED (Gradient $\textbf{Cach}$ing for $\textbf{E}$ncoder-$\textbf{D}$ecoder models), an approach that enables end-to-end training of existing transformer-based encoder-decoder models, using the entire document without truncation. Specifically, we apply non-overlapping sliding windows to input documents, followed by fusion in decoder. During backpropagation, the gradients are cached at the decoder and are passed through the encoder in chunks by re-computing the hidden vectors, similar to gradient checkpointing. In the experiments on long document summarization, we extend BART to CachED BART, processing more than 500K tokens during training and achieving superior performance without using any additional parameters.

<title>Jailbreaking Multimodal Large Language Models via Shuffle Inconsistency</title>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performance and have been put into practical use in commercial applications, but they still have potential safety mechanism vulnerabilities. Jailbreak attacks are red teaming methods that aim to bypass safety mechanisms and discover MLLMs' potential risks. Existing MLLMs' jailbreak methods often bypass the model's safety mechanism through complex optimization methods or carefully designed image and text prompts. Despite achieving some progress, they have a low attack success rate on commercial closed-source MLLMs. Unlike previous research, we empirically find that there exists a Shuffle Inconsistency between MLLMs' comprehension ability and safety ability for the shuffled harmful instruction. That is, from the perspective of comprehension ability, MLLMs can understand the shuffled harmful text-image instructions well. However, they can be easily bypassed by the shuffled harmful instructions from the perspective of safety ability, leading to harmful responses. Then we innovatively propose a text-image jailbreak attack named SI-Attack. Specifically, to fully utilize the Shuffle Inconsistency and overcome the shuffle randomness, we apply a query-based black-box optimization method to select the most harmful shuffled inputs based on the feedback of the toxic judge model. A series of experiments show that SI-Attack can improve the attack's performance on three benchmarks. In particular, SI-Attack can obviously improve the attack success rate for commercial MLLMs such as GPT-4o or Claude-3.5-Sonnet.

<title>No More Sliding Window: Efficient 3D Medical Image Segmentation with Differentiable Top-k Patch Sampling</title>

Abstract: 3D models surpass 2D models in CT/MRI segmentation by effectively capturing inter-slice relationships. However, the added depth dimension substantially increases memory consumption. While patch-based training alleviates memory constraints, it significantly slows down the inference speed due to the sliding window (SW) approach. We propose No-More-Sliding-Window (NMSW), a novel end-to-end trainable framework that enhances the efficiency of generic 3D segmentation backbone during an inference step by eliminating the need for SW. NMSW employs a differentiable Top-k module to selectively sample only the most relevant patches, thereby minimizing redundant computations. When patch-level predictions are insufficient, the framework intelligently leverages coarse global predictions to refine results. Evaluated across 3 tasks using 3 segmentation backbones, NMSW achieves competitive accuracy compared to SW inference while significantly reducing computational complexity by 91% (88.0 to 8.00 TMACs). Moreover, it delivers a 9.1x faster inference on the H100 GPU (99.0 to 8.3 sec) and a 11.1x faster inference on the Xeon Gold CPU (2110 to 189 sec). NMSW is model-agnostic, further boosting efficiency when integrated with any existing efficient segmentation backbones. The code is avaialble: https://github.com/Youngseok0001/open_nmsw.

Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their ability to solve Olympiad-level math problems. However, the training and evaluation of these models are constrained by the limited size and quality of available datasets, as creating large-scale data for such advanced problems requires extensive effort from human experts. In addition, current benchmarks are prone to contamination, leading to unreliable evaluations. In this paper, we present an automated pipeline that leverages the rich resources of the Art of Problem Solving (AoPS) forum, which predominantly features Olympiad-level problems and community-driven solutions. Using open-source LLMs, we develop a method to extract question-answer pairs from the forum, resulting in AoPS-Instruct, a dataset of more than 600,000 high-quality QA pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs on AoPS-Instruct improves their reasoning abilities across various benchmarks. Moreover, we build an automatic pipeline that introduces LiveAoPSBench, an evolving evaluation set with timestamps, derived from the latest forum data, providing a contamination-resistant benchmark for assessing LLM performance. Notably, we observe a significant decline in LLM performance over time, suggesting their success on older examples may stem from pre-training exposure rather than true reasoning ability. Our work presents a scalable approach to creating and maintaining large-scale, high-quality datasets for advanced math reasoning, offering valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in this domain.

Abstract: It is difficult to anticipate the myriad challenges that a predictive model will encounter once deployed. Common practice entails a reactive, cyclical approach: model deployment, data mining, and retraining. We instead develop a proactive longtail discovery process by imagining additional data during training. In particular, we develop general model-based longtail signals, including a differentiable, single forward pass formulation of epistemic uncertainty that does not impact model parameters or predictive performance but can flag rare or hard inputs. We leverage these signals as guidance to generate additional training data from a latent diffusion model in a process we call Longtail Guidance (LTG). Crucially, we can perform LTG without retraining the diffusion model or the predictive model, and we do not need to expose the predictive model to intermediate diffusion states. Data generated by LTG exhibit semantically meaningful variation, yield significant generalization improvements on numerous image classification benchmarks, and can be analyzed by a VLM to proactively discover, textually explain, and address conceptual gaps in a deployed predictive model.

<title>MedRAG: Enhancing Retrieval-augmented Generation with Knowledge Graph-Elicited Reasoning for Healthcare Copilot</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a well-suited technique for retrieving privacy-sensitive Electronic Health Records (EHR). It can serve as a key module of the healthcare copilot, helping reduce misdiagnosis for healthcare practitioners and patients. However, the diagnostic accuracy and specificity of existing heuristic-based RAG models used in the medical domain are inadequate, particularly for diseases with similar manifestations. This paper proposes MedRAG, a RAG model enhanced by knowledge graph (KG)-elicited reasoning for the medical domain that retrieves diagnosis and treatment recommendations based on manifestations. MedRAG systematically constructs a comprehensive four-tier hierarchical diagnostic KG encompassing critical diagnostic differences of various diseases. These differences are dynamically integrated with similar EHRs retrieved from an EHR database, and reasoned within a large language model. This process enables more accurate and specific decision support, while also proactively providing follow-up questions to enhance personalized medical decision-making. MedRAG is evaluated on both a public dataset DDXPlus and a private chronic pain diagnostic dataset (CPDD) collected from Tan Tock Seng Hospital, and its performance is compared against various existing RAG methods. Experimental results show that, leveraging the information integration and relational abilities of the KG, our MedRAG provides more specific diagnostic insights and outperforms state-of-the-art models in reducing misdiagnosis rates.

<title>AB-UPT: Scaling Neural CFD Surrogates for High-Fidelity Automotive Aerodynamics Simulations via Anchored-Branched Universal Physics Transformers</title>

arXiv:2502.09692v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in neural surrogate modeling offer the potential for transformative innovations in applications such as automotive aerodynamics. Yet, industrial-scale problems often involve volumetric meshes with cell counts reaching 100 million, presenting major scalability challenges. Complex geometries further complicate modeling through intricate surface-volume interactions, while quantities such as vorticity are highly nonlinear and must satisfy strict divergence-free constraints. To address these requirements, we introduce Anchored-Branched Universal Physics Transformers (AB-UPT) as a novel modeling scheme for building neural surrogates for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. AB-UPT is designed to: (i) decouple geometry encoding and prediction tasks via multi-branch operators; (ii) enable scalability to high-resolution outputs via neural simulation in a low-dimensional latent space, coupled with anchored neural field decoders to predict high-fidelity outputs; (iii) enforce physics consistency by a novel divergence-free formulation. We show that AB-UPT yields state-of-the-art predictive accuracy of surface and volume fields on automotive CFD simulations ranging from 33 thousand up to 150 million mesh cells. Furthermore, our anchored neural field architecture enables the enforcement of hard physical constraints on the physics predictions without degradation in performance, exemplified by modeling divergence-free vorticity fields. Notably, the proposed models can be trained on a single GPU in less than a day and predict industry-standard surface and volume fields within seconds. Additionally, we show that the flexible design of our method enables neural simulation from a computer-aided design geometry alone, omitting the need for costly CFD meshing procedures.

Abstract: With the growing adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in document processing, robust text recognition has become increasingly critical for knowledge extraction. While OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for English and other languages benefits from large datasets and well-established benchmarks, Arabic OCR faces unique challenges due to its cursive script, right-to-left text flow, and complex typographic and calligraphic features. We present KITAB-Bench, a comprehensive Arabic OCR benchmark that fills the gaps in current evaluation systems. Our benchmark comprises 8,809 samples across 9 major domains and 36 sub-domains, encompassing diverse document types including handwritten text, structured tables, and specialized coverage of 21 chart types for business intelligence. Our findings show that modern vision-language models (such as GPT-4o, Gemini, and Qwen) outperform traditional OCR approaches (like EasyOCR, PaddleOCR, and Surya) by an average of 60% in Character Error Rate (CER). Furthermore, we highlight significant limitations of current Arabic OCR models, particularly in PDF-to-Markdown conversion, where the best model Gemini-2.0-Flash achieves only 65% accuracy. This underscores the challenges in accurately recognizing Arabic text, including issues with complex fonts, numeral recognition errors, word elongation, and table structure detection. This work establishes a rigorous evaluation framework that can drive improvements in Arabic document analysis methods and bridge the performance gap with English OCR technologies.

Abstract: The increasing context window size in large language models (LLMs) has improved their ability to handle complex, long-text tasks. However, as the conversation rounds continue, it is required to store a large amount of KV cache in GPU memory, which significantly affects the efficiency and even availability of the model serving systems. This paper analyzes dialogue data from real users on the granularity of round and discovers that the LLM inference manifests a watershed layer, after which the distribution of round-level attention shows notable similarity. Based on this, we propose Round Attention - a novel round-level attention mechanism that selectively processes the KV cache of top-k relevant rounds, where k is dynamically determined through the attention matrix in the watershed layer. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that our method reduces memory usage by 54\% to 82\%, while experimental results confirm that loading sparse critical-round KV cache maintains answer accuracy without performance degradation.

arXiv:2502.20380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of code generation from multi-turn execution feedback. Existing methods either generate code without feedback or use complex, hierarchical reinforcement learning to optimize multi-turn rewards. We propose a simple yet scalable approach, $\mu$Code, that solves multi-turn code generation using only single-step rewards. Our key insight is that code generation is a one-step recoverable MDP, where the correct code can be recovered from any intermediate code state in a single turn. $\mu$Code iteratively trains both a generator to provide code solutions conditioned on multi-turn execution feedback and a verifier to score the newly generated code. Experimental evaluations show that our approach achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art baselines. We provide analysis of the design choices of the reward models and policy, and show the efficacy of $\mu$Code at utilizing the execution feedback. Our code is available at https://github.com/portal-cornell/muCode.

<title>Collective Reasoning Among LLMs: A Framework for Answer Validation Without Ground Truth</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2502.20758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach in which several advanced large language models-specifically GPT-4-0125-preview, Meta-LLAMA-3-70B-Instruct, Claude-3-Opus, and Gemini-1.5-Flash-collaborate to both produce and answer intricate, doctoral-level probability problems without relying on any single "correct" reference. Rather than depending on an established ground truth, our investigation focuses on how agreement among diverse models can signal the reliability of their outputs and, by extension, reflect the overall quality of the generated questions. To measure this inter-model alignment, we apply a suite of statistical evaluations, including chi-square tests, Fleiss' Kappa coefficients, and confidence interval calculations, thereby capturing both precision in answers and clarity in question phrasing. Our analysis reveals that Claude and Gemini tend to frame questions more coherently and unambiguously, which is evidenced by their tighter confidence intervals and greater concordance with responding agents. In contrast, LLAMA exhibits wider confidence bands and a lower level of agreement, indicating more variability and reduced consistency in its question formulations. These observations support the notion that a multi-model collaborative strategy not only improves answer dependability but also offers an effective, data-driven mechanism for evaluating and refining question quality when no definitive solution exists. Ultimately, this work delivers actionable insights into enhancing AI-guided reasoning processes through coordinated interactions among heterogeneous language models.

Abstract: Graphical assets play an important role in the design and development of games. There is potential in the use of AI-driven generative tools, to aid in creating graphical assets, thus improving game design and development pipelines. However, there is little research to address how the generative methods can fit into the wider pipeline. There also no guidelines or heuristics for creating such tools. To address this gap we conducted a user study with 16 game designers and developers to examine their behaviour and interaction with generative tools for graphical assets. The findings highlight that early design stage is preferred by all participants. Designers and developers are inclined to use such tools for creating large amounts of variations at the cost of quality as they can improve the quality of the artefacts once they generate a suitable asset. The results also strongly raised the need for better integration of such tools in existing design and development environments and the need for the outputs to be in common data formats, to be manipulatable and smoothly integrate into existing environments. The study also highlights the requirement for further emphasis on the needs of the users to incorporate these tools effectively in existing pipelines. Informed by these results, we provide a set of heuristics for creating tools that meet the expectations and needs of game designers and developers.

Abstract: For consumer usage of locally deployed LLMs, the GGUF format and k\_quantization are invaluable tools for maintaining the performance of the original model while reducing it to sizes deployable with consumer-grade hardware. The number of bits dedicated to each weight from the original model is reduced based on how important they are thought to be during model inference. This importance is arrived at through the application of an 'importance matrix'-a relatively small text document meant to be representative of the LLM's standard use-cases. In the vast majority of quants available online, this document is primarily written in English. It was therefore an open question whether performance on English language tasks was preserved through the sacrifice of multilingual performance and whether it can be preserved with alternate importance matrices. This article investigates these hypotheses by quantizing Llama3.3 70B on importance matrices written in three languages (English, Norwegian, and Malayalam) and evaluating them on the MixEval dataset in both English and Norwegian. All experiments related to yielded non-significant results indicating that current quantization practices do not disproportionately harm multilingual performance.

Abstract: Context: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is transforming much of software development, yet its application in software architecture is still in its infancy, and no prior study has systematically addressed the topic. Aim: We aim to systematically synthesize the use, rationale, contexts, usability, and future challenges of GenAI in software architecture. Method: We performed a multivocal literature review (MLR), analyzing peer-reviewed and gray literature, identifying current practices, models, adoption contexts, and reported challenges, extracting themes via open coding. Results: Our review identified significant adoption of GenAI for architectural decision support and architectural reconstruction. OpenAI GPT models are predominantly applied, and there is consistent use of techniques such as few-shot prompting and retrieved-augmented generation (RAG). GenAI has been applied mostly to initial stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), such as Requirements-to-Architecture and Architecture-to-Code. Monolithic and microservice architectures were the dominant targets. However, rigorous testing of GenAI outputs was typically missing from the studies. Among the most frequent challenges are model precision, hallucinations, ethical aspects, privacy issues, lack of architecture-specific datasets, and the absence of sound evaluation frameworks. Conclusions: GenAI shows significant potential in software design, but several challenges remain on its path to greater adoption. Research efforts should target designing general evaluation methodologies, handling ethics and precision, increasing transparency and explainability, and promoting architecture-specific datasets and benchmarks to bridge the gap between theoretical possibilities and practical use.

Abstract: Game Description Generation (GDG) is the task of generating a game description written in a Game Description Language (GDL) from natural language text. Previous studies have explored generation methods leveraging the contextual understanding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs); however, accurately reproducing the game features of the game descriptions remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning of LLMs for GDG (RLGDG). Our training method simultaneously improves grammatical correctness and fidelity to game concepts by introducing both grammar rewards and concept rewards. Furthermore, we adopt a two-stage training strategy where Reinforcement Learning (RL) is applied following Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms baseline methods using SFT alone. Our code is available at https://github.com/tsunehiko/rlgdg

Abstract: Atomicity violations in interrupt-driven programs pose a significant threat to software safety in critical systems. These violations occur when the execution sequence of operations on shared resources is disrupted by asynchronous interrupts. Detecting atomicity violations is challenging due to the vast program state space, application-level code dependencies, and complex domain-specific knowledge. We propose Clover, a hybrid framework that integrates static analysis with large language model (LLM) agents to detect atomicity violations in real-world programs. Clover first performs static analysis to extract critical code snippets and operation information. It then initiates a multi-agent process, where the expert agent leverages domain-specific knowledge to detect atomicity violations, which are subsequently validated by the judge agent. Evaluations on RaceBench 2.1, SV-COMP, and RWIP demonstrate that Clover achieves a precision/recall of 92.3%/86.6%, outperforming existing approaches by 27.4-118.2% on F1-score.

Abstract: Loops--short audio segments designed for seamless repetition--are central to many music genres, particularly those rooted in dance and electronic styles. However, current generative music models struggle to produce truly loopable audio, as generating a short waveform alone does not guarantee a smooth transition from its endpoint back to its start, often resulting in audible discontinuities. We address this gap by modifying a non-autoregressive model (MAGNeT) to generate tokens in a circular pattern, letting the model attend to the beginning of the audio when creating its ending. This inference-only approach results in generations that are aware of future context and loop naturally, without the need for any additional training or data. We evaluate the consistency of loop transitions by computing token perplexity around the seam of the loop, observing a 55% improvement. Blind listening tests further confirm significant perceptual gains over baseline methods, improving mean ratings by 70%. Taken together, these results highlight the effectiveness of inference-only approaches in improving generative models and underscore the advantages of non-autoregressive methods for context-aware music generation.

<title>USM-VC: Mitigating Timbre Leakage with Universal Semantic Mapping Residual Block for Voice Conversion</title>

Abstract: Voice conversion (VC) transforms source speech into a target voice by preserving the content. However, timbre information from the source speaker is inherently embedded in the content representations, causing significant timbre leakage and reducing similarity to the target speaker. To address this, we introduce a Universal Semantic Matching (USM) residual block to a content extractor. The residual block consists of two weighted branches: 1) universal semantic dictionary based Content Feature Re-expression (CFR) module, supplying timbre-free content representation. 2) skip connection to the original content layer, providing complementary fine-grained information. In the CFR module, each dictionary entry in the universal semantic dictionary represents a phoneme class, computed statistically using speech from multiple speakers, creating a stable, speaker-independent semantic set. We introduce a CFR method to obtain timbre-free content representations by expressing each content frame as a weighted linear combination of dictionary entries using corresponding phoneme posteriors as weights. Extensive experiments across various VC frameworks demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates timbre leakage and significantly improves similarity to the target speaker.

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) represents a rich repository of ancient medical knowledge that continues to play an important role in modern healthcare. Due to the complexity and breadth of the TCM literature, the integration of AI technologies is critical for its modernization and broader accessibility. However, this integration poses considerable challenges, including the interpretation of obscure classical Chinese texts and the modeling of intricate semantic relationships among TCM concepts. In this paper, we develop OpenTCM, an LLM-based system that combines a domain-specific TCM knowledge graph and Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG). First, we extract more than 3.73 million classical Chinese characters from 68 gynecological books in the Chinese Medical Classics Database, with the help of TCM and gynecology experts. Second, we construct a comprehensive multi-relational knowledge graph comprising more than 48,000 entities and 152,000 interrelationships, using customized prompts and Chinese-oriented LLMs such as DeepSeek and Kimi to ensure high-fidelity semantic understanding. Last, we empower OpenTCM with GraphRAG, enabling high-fidelity ingredient knowledge retrieval and diagnostic question-answering without model fine-tuning. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that OpenTCM achieves mean expert scores (MES) of 4.378 in ingredient information retrieval and 4.045 in diagnostic question-answering tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in real-world TCM use cases.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which can compromise their safety mechanisms. Existing studies often rely on brute-force optimization or manual design, failing to uncover potential risks in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose a novel jailbreak attack framework, ICRT, inspired by heuristics and biases in human cognition. Leveraging the simplicity effect, we employ cognitive decomposition to reduce the complexity of malicious prompts. Simultaneously, relevance bias is utilized to reorganize prompts, enhancing semantic alignment and inducing harmful outputs effectively. Furthermore, we introduce a ranking-based harmfulness evaluation metric that surpasses the traditional binary success-or-failure paradigm by employing ranking aggregation methods such as Elo, HodgeRank, and Rank Centrality to comprehensively quantify the harmfulness of generated content. Experimental results show that our approach consistently bypasses mainstream LLMs' safety mechanisms and generates high-risk content, providing insights into jailbreak attack risks and contributing to stronger defense strategies.

Abstract: Object rearrangement is a key task for household robots requiring personalization without explicit instructions, meaningful object placement in environments occupied with objects, and generalization to unseen objects and new environments. To facilitate research addressing these challenges, we introduce PARSEC, an object rearrangement benchmark for learning user organizational preferences from observed scene context to place objects in a partially arranged environment. PARSEC is built upon a novel dataset of 110K rearrangement examples crowdsourced from 72 users, featuring 93 object categories and 15 environments. To better align with real-world organizational habits, we propose ContextSortLM, an LLM-based personalized rearrangement model that handles flexible user preferences by explicitly accounting for objects with multiple valid placement locations when placing items in partially arranged environments. We evaluate ContextSortLM and existing personalized rearrangement approaches on the PARSEC benchmark and complement these findings with a crowdsourced evaluation of 108 online raters ranking model predictions based on alignment with user preferences. Our results indicate that personalized rearrangement models leveraging multiple scene context sources perform better than models relying on a single context source. Moreover, ContextSortLM outperforms other models in placing objects to replicate the target user's arrangement and ranks among the top two in all three environment categories, as rated by online evaluators. Importantly, our evaluation highlights challenges associated with modeling environment semantics across different environment categories and provides recommendations for future work.

<title>Improving LLM Outputs Against Jailbreak Attacks with Expert Model Integration</title>

Abstract: Using LLMs in a production environment presents security challenges that include vulnerabilities to jailbreaks and prompt injections, which can result in harmful outputs for humans or the enterprise. The challenge is amplified when working within a specific domain, as topics generally accepted for LLMs to address may be irrelevant to that field. These problems can be mitigated, for example, by fine-tuning large language models with domain-specific and security-focused data. However, these alone are insufficient, as jailbreak techniques evolve. Additionally, API-accessed models do not offer the flexibility needed to tailor behavior to industry-specific objectives, and in-context learning is not always sufficient or reliable. In response to these challenges, we introduce Archias, an expert model adept at distinguishing between in-domain and out-of-domain communications. Archias classifies user inquiries into several categories: in-domain (specifically for the automotive industry), malicious questions, price injections, prompt injections, and out-of-domain examples. Our methodology integrates outputs from the expert model (Archias) into prompts, which are then processed by the LLM to generate responses. This method increases the model's ability to understand the user's intention and give appropriate answers. Archias can be adjusted, fine-tuned, and used for many different purposes due to its small size. Therefore, it can be easily customized to the needs of any industry. To validate our approach, we created a benchmark dataset for the automotive industry. Furthermore, in the interest of advancing research and development, we release our benchmark dataset to the community.

Abstract: We investigate the mechanism underlying a previously identified phenomenon in Vision Transformers -- the emergence of high-norm tokens that lead to noisy attention maps. We observe that in multiple models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2), a sparse set of neurons is responsible for concentrating high-norm activations on outlier tokens, leading to irregular attention patterns and degrading downstream visual processing. While the existing solution for removing these outliers involves retraining models from scratch with additional learned register tokens, we use our findings to create a training-free approach to mitigate these artifacts. By shifting the high-norm activations from our discovered register neurons into an additional untrained token, we can mimic the effect of register tokens on a model already trained without registers. We demonstrate that our method produces cleaner attention and feature maps, enhances performance over base models across multiple downstream visual tasks, and achieves results comparable to models explicitly trained with register tokens. We then extend test-time registers to off-the-shelf vision-language models to improve their interpretability. Our results suggest that test-time registers effectively take on the role of register tokens at test-time, offering a training-free solution for any pre-trained model released without them.

Abstract: Graphs are a powerful data structure for representing relational data and are widely used to describe complex real-world systems. Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can both leverage graph-structured data, but their inherent functioning is different. The question is how do they compare in capturing the information contained in networked datasets? We address this objective by solving a link prediction task and we conduct three main experiments, on both synthetic and real networks: one focuses on how PGMs and GNNs handle input features, while the other two investigate their robustness to noisy features and increasing heterophily of the graph. PGMs do not necessarily require features on nodes, while GNNs cannot exploit the network edges alone, and the choice of input features matters. We find that GNNs are outperformed by PGMs when input features are low-dimensional or noisy, mimicking many real scenarios where node attributes might be scalar or noisy. Then, we find that PGMs are more robust than GNNs when the heterophily of the graph is increased. Finally, to assess performance beyond prediction tasks, we also compare the two frameworks in terms of their computational complexity and interpretability.

<title>FEAST: A Flexible Mealtime-Assistance System Towards In-the-Wild Personalization</title>

arXiv:2506.14968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical caregiving robots hold promise for improving the quality of life of millions worldwide who require assistance with feeding. However, in-home meal assistance remains challenging due to the diversity of activities (e.g., eating, drinking, mouth wiping), contexts (e.g., socializing, watching TV), food items, and user preferences that arise during deployment. In this work, we propose FEAST, a flexible mealtime-assistance system that can be personalized in-the-wild to meet the unique needs of individual care recipients. Developed in collaboration with two community researchers and informed by a formative study with a diverse group of care recipients, our system is guided by three key tenets for in-the-wild personalization: adaptability, transparency, and safety. FEAST embodies these principles through: (i) modular hardware that enables switching between assisted feeding, drinking, and mouth-wiping, (ii) diverse interaction methods, including a web interface, head gestures, and physical buttons, to accommodate diverse functional abilities and preferences, and (iii) parameterized behavior trees that can be safely and transparently adapted using a large language model. We evaluate our system based on the personalization requirements identified in our formative study, demonstrating that FEAST offers a wide range of transparent and safe adaptations and outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline limited to fixed customizations. To demonstrate real-world applicability, we conduct an in-home user study with two care recipients (who are community researchers), feeding them three meals each across three diverse scenarios. We further assess FEAST's ecological validity by evaluating with an Occupational Therapist previously unfamiliar with the system. In all cases, users successfully personalize FEAST to meet their individual needs and preferences. Website: https://emprise.cs.cornell.edu/feast

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the use of small datasets in the context of offline reinforcement learning (RL). While many common offline RL benchmarks employ datasets with over a million data points, many offline RL applications rely on considerably smaller datasets. We show that offline RL algorithms can overfit on small datasets, resulting in poor performance. To address this challenge, we introduce "Sparse-Reg": a regularization technique based on sparsity to mitigate overfitting in offline reinforcement learning, enabling effective learning in limited data settings and outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in continuous control.

Abstract: This paper presents an evaluation framework for agentic AI systems in mission-critical negotiation contexts, addressing the need for AI agents that can adapt to diverse human operators and stakeholders. Using Sotopia as a simulation testbed, we present two experiments that systematically evaluated how personality traits and AI agent characteristics influence LLM-simulated social negotiation outcomes--a capability essential for a variety of applications involving cross-team coordination and civil-military interactions. Experiment 1 employs causal discovery methods to measure how personality traits impact price bargaining negotiations, through which we found that Agreeableness and Extraversion significantly affect believability, goal achievement, and knowledge acquisition outcomes. Sociocognitive lexical measures extracted from team communications detected fine-grained differences in agents' empathic communication, moral foundations, and opinion patterns, providing actionable insights for agentic AI systems that must operate reliably in high-stakes operational scenarios. Experiment 2 evaluates human-AI job negotiations by manipulating both simulated human personality and AI system characteristics, specifically transparency, competence, adaptability, demonstrating how AI agent trustworthiness impact mission effectiveness. These findings establish a repeatable evaluation methodology for experimenting with AI agent reliability across diverse operator personalities and human-agent team dynamics, directly supporting operational requirements for reliable AI systems. Our work advances the evaluation of agentic AI workflows by moving beyond standard performance metrics to incorporate social dynamics essential for mission success in complex operations.

Abstract: Rapidly improving AI capabilities and autonomy hold significant promise of transformation, but are also driving vigorous debate on how to ensure that AI is safe, i.e., trustworthy, reliable, and secure. Building a trusted ecosystem is therefore essential -- it helps people embrace AI with confidence and gives maximal space for innovation while avoiding backlash.
  The "2025 Singapore Conference on AI (SCAI): International Scientific Exchange on AI Safety" aimed to support research in this space by bringing together AI scientists across geographies to identify and synthesise research priorities in AI safety. This resulting report builds on the International AI Safety Report chaired by Yoshua Bengio and backed by 33 governments. By adopting a defence-in-depth model, this report organises AI safety research domains into three types: challenges with creating trustworthy AI systems (Development), challenges with evaluating their risks (Assessment), and challenges with monitoring and intervening after deployment (Control).

Summary:
The paper investigates whether LLM-based agents understand contextual privacy and can maintain user privacy during multi-turn conversations in collaborative tasks. A new benchmark, MAGPIE, with 158 challenging scenarios across 15 domains, tests the agents' ability to balance task completion with privacy preservation. Current LLM models, including GPT-4o and Claude-2.7-Sonnet, struggle with contextual privacy, misclassifying private data and disclosing it in multi-turn conversations despite explicit privacy instructions. In multi-agent systems, task completion fails in the majority of scenarios, indicating a lack of alignment towards both privacy preservation and task-solving. The study highlights the urgent need for improved privacy understanding and protection mechanisms in LLM-based systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The proliferation of LLM-based agents has led to increasing deployment of inter-agent collaboration for tasks like scheduling, negotiation, resource allocation etc. In such systems, privacy is critical, as agents often access proprietary tools and domain-specific databases requiring strict confidentiality. This paper examines whether LLM-based agents demonstrate an understanding of contextual privacy. And, if instructed, do these systems preserve inference time user privacy in non-adversarial multi-turn conversation. Existing benchmarks to evaluate contextual privacy in LLM-agents primarily assess single-turn, low-complexity tasks where private information can be easily excluded. We first present a benchmark - MAGPIE comprising 158 real-life high-stakes scenarios across 15 domains. These scenarios are designed such that complete exclusion of private data impedes task completion yet unrestricted information sharing could lead to substantial losses. We then evaluate the current state-of-the-art LLMs on (a) their understanding of contextually private data and (b) their ability to collaborate without violating user privacy. Empirical experiments demonstrate that current models, including GPT-4o and Claude-2.7-Sonnet, lack robust understanding of contextual privacy, misclassifying private data as shareable 25.2\% and 43.6\% of the time. In multi-turn conversations, these models disclose private information in 59.9\% and 50.5\% of cases even under explicit privacy instructions. Furthermore, multi-agent systems fail to complete tasks in 71\% of scenarios. These results underscore that current models are not aligned towards both contextual privacy preservation and collaborative task-solving.

Language model-based agents are increasingly influencing societal decisions, necessitating a thorough understanding of their impact. A new framework has been proposed to project the macroscopic propagation of model-generated advice over time, enhancing alignment and ensuring beneficial outcomes. Additionally, a dataset comprising 100 indirect harm scenarios has been introduced to evaluate models' ability to anticipate negative consequences from seemingly harmless prompts. This approach has shown significant improvement in identifying potential harm, with a success rate of over 70% against established safety benchmarks. The results suggest a promising direction for the development of safer language models.

Abstract: Given the growing influence of language model-based agents on high-stakes societal decisions, from public policy to healthcare, ensuring their beneficial impact requires understanding the far-reaching implications of their suggestions. We propose a proof-of-concept framework that projects how model-generated advice could propagate through societal systems on a macroscopic scale over time, enabling more robust alignment. To assess the long-term safety awareness of language models, we also introduce a dataset of 100 indirect harm scenarios, testing models' ability to foresee adverse, non-obvious outcomes from seemingly harmless user prompts. Our approach achieves not only over 20% improvement on the new dataset but also an average win rate exceeding 70% against strong baselines on existing safety benchmarks (AdvBench, SafeRLHF, WildGuardMix), suggesting a promising direction for safer agents.

Summary:
Causal reasoning is crucial for advancing large language models (LLMs) towards strong artificial intelligence. While LLMs show understanding of contextual causality, they lack genuine human-like causal reasoning abilities. The autoregression mechanism of transformer-based LLMs is not inherently causal. A new causal Q&amp;A benchmark, CausalProbe-2024, reveals LLMs' limitation in level-2 causal reasoning. The proposed G^2-Reasoner method enhances LLMs' causal reasoning by incorporating general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts. This work paves the way for LLMs to progress towards genuine causal reasoning beyond level-1 and towards level-2. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Causal reasoning capability is critical in advancing large language models (LLMs) toward strong artificial intelligence. While versatile LLMs appear to have demonstrated capabilities in understanding contextual causality and providing responses that obey the laws of causality, it remains unclear whether they perform genuine causal reasoning akin to humans. However, current evidence indicates the contrary. Specifically, LLMs are only capable of performing shallow (level-1) causal reasoning, primarily attributed to the causal knowledge embedded in their parameters, but they lack the capacity for genuine human-like (level-2) causal reasoning. To support this hypothesis, methodologically, we delve into the autoregression mechanism of transformer-based LLMs, revealing that it is not inherently causal. Empirically, we introduce a new causal Q&amp;A benchmark called CausalProbe-2024, whose corpora are fresh and nearly unseen for the studied LLMs. The LLMs exhibit a significant performance drop on CausalProbe-2024 compared to earlier benchmarks, indicating the fact that they primarily engage in level-1 causal reasoning. To bridge the gap towards level-2 causal reasoning, we draw inspiration from the fact that human reasoning is usually facilitated by general knowledge and intended goals. We propose G^2-Reasoner, a method that incorporates general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts into LLMs' causal reasoning processes. Experiments demonstrate that G^2-Reasoner significantly enhances LLMs' causal reasoning capability, particularly in fresh and counterfactual contexts. This work sheds light on a new path for LLMs to advance towards genuine causal reasoning, going beyond level-1 and making strides towards level-2.

Summary:
The study introduces a framework called World-Aware Planning Narrative Enhancement (WAP) to enhance Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for embodied planning tasks. The framework focuses on four cognitive capabilities: visual appearance modeling, spatial reasoning, functional abstraction, and syntactic grounding. Models are developed using raw visual observations through curriculum learning. Evaluation on the EB-ALFRED benchmark shows significant improvements in task success rates, particularly in commonsense reasoning and long-horizon planning. The enhanced models, Qwen2.5-VL, outperform proprietary systems like GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet by a large margin. This framework aims to improve the performance of LVLMs in complex scenarios involving unfamiliar environments and multi-step goals by infusing them with comprehensive environmental understanding.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show promise for embodied planning tasks but struggle with complex scenarios involving unfamiliar environments and multi-step goals. Current approaches rely on environment-agnostic imitation learning that disconnects instructions from environmental contexts, causing models to struggle with context-sensitive instructions and rely on supplementary cues rather than visual reasoning during long-horizon interactions. In this work, we propose World-Aware Planning Narrative Enhancement (WAP), a framework that infuses LVLMs with comprehensive environmental understanding through four cognitive capabilities (visual appearance modeling, spatial reasoning, functional abstraction, and syntactic grounding) while developing and evaluating models using only raw visual observations through curriculum learning. Evaluations on the EB-ALFRED benchmark demonstrate substantial improvements, with Qwen2.5-VL achieving a 60.7 absolute improvement in task success rates, particularly in commonsense reasoning (+60.0) and long-horizon planning (+70.0). Notably, our enhanced open-source models outperform proprietary systems like GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet by a large margin.

Abstract: Although several post-hoc methods for explainable AI have been developed, most are static and neglect the user perspective, limiting their effectiveness for the target audience. In response, we developed the interactive explainable intelligent system called IXAII that offers explanations from four explainable AI methods: LIME, SHAP, Anchors, and DiCE. Our prototype provides tailored views for five user groups and gives users agency over the explanations' content and their format. We evaluated IXAII through interviews with experts and lay users. Our results indicate that IXAII, which provides different explanations with multiple visualization options, is perceived as helpful to increase transparency. By bridging the gaps between explainable AI methods, interactivity, and practical implementation, we provide a novel perspective on AI explanation practices and human-AI interaction.

<div> Keywords: artificial intelligence, scientific discovery, active inference, internal representations, causal reasoning 

Summary:
The article discusses the limitations of current artificial intelligence systems in driving scientific discovery due to operational architectures, reasoning mechanisms, and separation from experimental reality. To bridge the gaps in AI-driven science, the authors propose active inference AI systems that maintain research memories, use Bayesian guardrails for reasoning, develop knowledge graphs through continuous learning, and refine internal representations through interactions with simulators and laboratories. These systems aim to support counterfactual reasoning and ground hypotheses in reality through a feedback loop of mental simulation and empirical validation. The authors emphasize the importance of human judgment in navigating feedback ambiguity and uncertainties in the scientific discovery process. <div>

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence has led to expectations of transformative scientific discovery, yet current systems remain fundamentally limited by their operational architectures, brittle reasoning mechanisms, and their separation from experimental reality. Building on earlier work, we contend that progress in AI-driven science now depends on closing three fundamental gaps -- the abstraction gap, the reasoning gap, and the reality gap -- rather than on model size/data/test time compute. Scientific reasoning demands internal representations that support simulation of actions and response, causal structures that distinguish correlation from mechanism, and continuous calibration. We define active inference AI systems for scientific discovery as those that (i) maintain long-lived research memories grounded in causal self-supervised foundation models, (ii) symbolic or neuro-symbolic planners equipped with Bayesian guardrails, (iii) grow persistent knowledge graphs where thinking generates novel conceptual nodes, reasoning establishes causal edges, and real-world interaction prunes false connections while strengthening verified pathways, and (iv) refine their internal representations through closed-loop interaction with both high-fidelity simulators and automated laboratories - an operational loop where mental simulation guides action and empirical surprise reshapes understanding. In essence, we outline an architecture where discovery arises from the interplay between internal models that enable counterfactual reasoning and external validation that grounds hypotheses in reality. It is also argued that the inherent ambiguity in feedback from simulations and experiments, and underlying uncertainties makes human judgment indispensable, not as a temporary scaffold but as a permanent architectural component.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal understanding, TableMoE, Neuro-Symbolic Routing, WildStruct benchmarks, Neuro-symbolic reasoning

Summary:
TableMoE is introduced as a neuro-symbolic architecture for structured reasoning over multimodal table data in real-world contexts. It features a Neuro-Symbolic Routing mechanism that predicts semantic token roles and routes table elements to specialized experts using a confidence-aware gating strategy informed by symbolic reasoning graphs. The TableMoE-Align dataset is introduced for model pretraining, consisting of 1.2M table-HTML-JSON-code quadruples across various fields. Four challenging WildStruct benchmarks are curated and released to stress-test models under complex conditions. Experimental results show TableMoE outperforms existing models significantly, with ablation studies confirming the importance of Neuro-Symbolic Routing and expert alignment. Qualitative analyses demonstrate TableMoE's interpretability and enhanced robustness, highlighting the effectiveness of integrating neuro-symbolic reasoning for multimodal table understanding. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.21393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal understanding of tables in real-world contexts is challenging due to the complexity of structure, symbolic density, and visual degradation (blur, skew, watermarking, incomplete structures or fonts, multi-span or hierarchically nested layouts). Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle with such WildStruct conditions, resulting in limited performance and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose TableMoE, a neuro-symbolic Mixture-of-Connector-Experts (MoCE) architecture specifically designed for robust, structured reasoning over multimodal table data. TableMoE features an innovative Neuro-Symbolic Routing mechanism, which predicts latent semantic token roles (e.g., header, data cell, axis, formula) and dynamically routes table elements to specialized experts (Table-to-HTML, Table-to-JSON, Table-to-Code) using a confidence-aware gating strategy informed by symbolic reasoning graphs. To facilitate effective alignment-driven pretraining, we introduce the large-scale TableMoE-Align dataset, consisting of 1.2M table-HTML-JSON-code quadruples across finance, science, biomedicine and industry, utilized exclusively for model pretraining. For evaluation, we curate and release four challenging WildStruct benchmarks: WMMFinQA, WMMTatQA, WMMTabDialog, and WMMFinanceMath, designed specifically to stress-test models under real-world multimodal degradation and structural complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that TableMoE significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art models. Extensive ablation studies validate each core component, emphasizing the critical role of Neuro-Symbolic Routing and structured expert alignment. Through qualitative analyses, we further showcase TableMoE's interpretability and enhanced robustness, underscoring the effectiveness of integrating neuro-symbolic reasoning for multimodal table understanding.

<div> Vision Language Models (VLMs), spatial mental models, MindCube, cognitive mapping, perspective-taking <br />
Summary: This study introduces the MindCube benchmark to evaluate the ability of Vision Language Models (VLMs) to imagine full scenes from limited views. Existing VLMs show poor performance in building spatial mental models compared to humans. The study assesses VLMs in representing positions, orientations, and dynamics, highlighting the importance of robust spatial mental models. Various approaches, including unseen intermediate views, natural language reasoning chains, and cognitive maps, are explored to improve VLMs' performance. The "map-then-reason" approach, which involves training models to generate cognitive maps before reasoning, leads to a significant accuracy boost. By incorporating reinforcement learning, performance is further improved, demonstrating the effectiveness of actively constructing and utilizing internal structured spatial representations in understanding unobservable space. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.21458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can Vision Language Models (VLMs) imagine the full scene from just a few views, like humans do? Humans form spatial mental models, internal representations of unseen space, to reason about layout, perspective, and motion. Our new MindCube benchmark with 21,154 questions across 3,268 images exposes this critical gap, where existing VLMs exhibit near-random performance. Using MindCube, we systematically evaluate how well VLMs build robust spatial mental models through representing positions (cognitive mapping), orientations (perspective-taking), and dynamics (mental simulation for "what-if" movements). We then explore three approaches to help VLMs approximate spatial mental models, including unseen intermediate views, natural language reasoning chains, and cognitive maps. The significant improvement comes from a synergistic approach, "map-then-reason", that jointly trains the model to first generate a cognitive map and then reason upon it. By training models to reason over these internal maps, we boosted accuracy from 37.8% to 60.8% (+23.0%). Adding reinforcement learning pushed performance even further to 70.7% (+32.9%). Our key insight is that such scaffolding of spatial mental models, actively constructing and utilizing internal structured spatial representations with flexible reasoning processes, significantly improves understanding of unobservable space.

Summary:<br />
Achieving seamless coordination between AI agents and humans is a challenging task. The cooperative card game Hanabi is used as a testbed for human-AI coordination due to its characteristics. To address the challenge of human evaluation, the Ad-Hoc Human-AI Coordination Challenge (AH2AC2) is introduced. Human proxy agents are developed using a large-scale human dataset to provide robust and inexpensive evaluation partners. A dataset of 3,079 games is open-sourced with limited human gameplay data to promote data-efficient methods. Baseline results for two- and three-player Hanabi scenarios are presented. To ensure fair evaluation, the proxy agents are hosted through a controlled system rather than being publicly released. The code for the challenge is available on GitHub at https://github.com/FLAIROx/ah2ac2. <br /><br />Summary: Achieving seamless coordination between AI agents and humans is crucial, and the Ad-Hoc Human-AI Coordination Challenge introduces human proxy agents for evaluation.

Abstract: Achieving seamless coordination between AI agents and humans is crucial for real-world applications, yet it remains a significant open challenge. Hanabi is a cooperative card game featuring imperfect information, constrained communication, theory of mind requirements, and coordinated action -- making it an ideal testbed for human-AI coordination. However, its use for human-AI interaction has been limited by the challenges of human evaluation. In this work, we introduce the Ad-Hoc Human-AI Coordination Challenge (AH2AC2) to overcome the constraints of costly and difficult-to-reproduce human evaluations. We develop \textit{human proxy agents} on a large-scale human dataset that serve as robust, cheap, and reproducible human-like evaluation partners in AH2AC2. To encourage the development of data-efficient methods, we open-source a dataset of 3,079 games, deliberately limiting the amount of available human gameplay data. We present baseline results for both two- and three- player Hanabi scenarios. To ensure fair evaluation, we host the proxy agents through a controlled evaluation system rather than releasing them publicly. The code is available at \href{https://github.com/FLAIROx/ah2ac2}{https://github.com/FLAIROx/ah2ac2}.

Summary:
The paper introduces Mind2Web 2, a benchmark comprising 130 realistic and long-horizon tasks for evaluating agentic search systems like Deep Research. These systems autonomously browse the web, synthesize information, and provide citation-backed answers. To address the challenge of evaluating complex and time-varying answers, the paper proposes an Agent-as-a-Judge framework that automatically assesses answer correctness and source attribution. A comprehensive evaluation of nine agentic search systems and human performance reveals that OpenAI Deep Research can achieve 50-70% of human performance in half the time. The benchmark helps in developing and benchmarking the next generation of agentic search systems.

arXiv:2506.21506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic search such as Deep Research systems, where large language models autonomously browse the web, synthesize information, and return comprehensive citation-backed answers, represents a major shift in how users interact with web-scale information. While promising greater efficiency and cognitive offloading, the growing complexity and open-endedness of agentic search have outpaced existing evaluation benchmarks and methodologies, which largely assume short search horizons and static answers. In this paper, we introduce Mind2Web 2, a benchmark of 130 realistic, high-quality, and long-horizon tasks that require real-time web browsing and extensive information synthesis, constructed with over 1,000 hours of human labor. To address the challenge of evaluating time-varying and complex answers, we propose a novel Agent-as-a-Judge framework. Our method constructs task-specific judge agents based on a tree-structured rubric design to automatically assess both answer correctness and source attribution. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of nine frontier agentic search systems and human performance, along with a detailed error analysis to draw insights for future development. The best-performing system, OpenAI Deep Research, can already achieve 50-70% of human performance while spending half the time, showing a great potential. Altogether, Mind2Web 2 provides a rigorous foundation for developing and benchmarking the next generation of agentic search systems.

Abstract: With the rapid development of digital technology, AI-driven psychological counseling has gradually become an important research direction in the field of mental health. However, existing models still have deficiencies in dialogue safety, detailed scenario handling, and lightweight deployment. To address these issues, this study proposes PsyLite, a lightweight psychological counseling large language model agent developed based on the base model InternLM2.5-7B-chat. Through a two-stage training strategy (hybrid distillation data fine-tuning and ORPO preference optimization), PsyLite enhances the model's deep-reasoning ability, psychological counseling ability, and safe dialogue ability. After deployment using Ollama and Open WebUI, a custom workflow is created with Pipelines. An innovative conditional RAG is designed to introduce crosstalk humor elements at appropriate times during psychological counseling to enhance user experience and decline dangerous requests to strengthen dialogue safety. Evaluations show that PsyLite outperforms the baseline models in the Chinese general evaluation (CEval), psychological counseling professional evaluation (CPsyCounE), and dialogue safety evaluation (SafeDialBench), particularly in psychological counseling professionalism (CPsyCounE score improvement of 47.6\%) and dialogue safety (\safe{} score improvement of 2.4\%). Additionally, the model uses quantization technology (GGUF q4\_k\_m) to achieve low hardware deployment (5GB memory is sufficient for operation), providing a feasible solution for psychological counseling applications in resource-constrained environments.

<div> DRAGON, Distributional RewArds for Generative OptimizatioN, is a framework for fine-tuning media generation models using versatile reward functions. Utilizing both instance-wise and distribution-based rewards, DRAGON can optimize models with various types of rewards. By selecting an encoder and reference examples, DRAGON constructs exemplar distributions and maximizes rewards by contrasting positive and negative sets of generated examples. In an evaluation with an audio-domain text-to-music model, DRAGON achieves an 81.45% average win rate across 20 different reward functions, including music aesthetics, diversity, and Frechet audio distance. Results show that exemplar-based rewards enhance generations and are comparable to model-based rewards. With an appropriate exemplar set, DRAGON achieves a 60.95% human-voted music quality win rate without relying on human feedback. This novel approach showcases the potential of designing and optimizing reward functions to improve human-perceived quality.

Abstract: We present Distributional RewArds for Generative OptimizatioN (DRAGON), a versatile framework for fine-tuning media generation models towards a desired outcome. Compared with traditional reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) or pairwise preference approaches such as direct preference optimization (DPO), DRAGON is more flexible. It can optimize reward functions that evaluate either individual examples or distributions of them, making it compatible with a broad spectrum of instance-wise, instance-to-distribution, and distribution-to-distribution rewards. Leveraging this versatility, we construct novel reward functions by selecting an encoder and a set of reference examples to create an exemplar distribution. When cross-modality encoders such as CLAP are used, the reference examples may be of a different modality (e.g., text versus audio). Then, DRAGON gathers online and on-policy generations, scores them to construct a positive demonstration set and a negative set, and leverages the contrast between the two sets to maximize the reward. For evaluation, we fine-tune an audio-domain text-to-music diffusion model with 20 different reward functions, including a custom music aesthetics model, CLAP score, Vendi diversity, and Frechet audio distance (FAD). We further compare instance-wise (per-song) and full-dataset FAD settings while ablating multiple FAD encoders and reference sets. Over all 20 target rewards, DRAGON achieves an 81.45% average win rate. Moreover, reward functions based on exemplar sets indeed enhance generations and are comparable to model-based rewards. With an appropriate exemplar set, DRAGON achieves a 60.95% human-voted music quality win rate without training on human preference annotations. As such, DRAGON exhibits a new approach to designing and optimizing reward functions for improving human-perceived quality. Sound examples at https://ml-dragon.github.io/web.

Summary:
Automatic fluency assessment in non-native speakers remains challenging. In this study, a chunk-based approach integrating self-supervised learning models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, WavLM) with a hierarchical CNN-BiLSTM framework was proposed. Speech is segmented into breath-group chunks using Silero-VAD for fine-grained temporal analysis. SSL embeddings are fused with a learnable weighted mechanism and enriched with fluency markers. The CNN-BiLSTM captures local and long-term dependencies across chunks. Evaluations on Avalinguo and Speechocean762 datasets showed improvements in F1-score and Pearson correlation compared to single SSL baselines and surpassing Pyannote.audio-based segmentation baselines. The findings highlight the effectiveness of chunk-based multi-SSL fusion for robust fluency evaluation, while suggesting the need for future work on generalization to dialects with irregular prosody.

Abstract: Automatic fluency assessment (AFA) remains challenging, particularly in capturing speech rhythm, pauses, and disfluencies in non-native speakers. We introduce a chunk-based approach integrating self-supervised learning (SSL) models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and WavLM) selected for their complementary strengths in phonetic, prosodic, and noisy speech modeling, with a hierarchical CNN-BiLSTM framework. Speech is segmented into breath-group chunks using Silero voice activity detection (Silero-VAD), enabling fine-grained temporal analysis while mitigating over-segmentation artifacts. SSL embeddings are fused via a learnable weighted mechanism, balancing acoustic and linguistic features, and enriched with chunk-level fluency markers (e.g., speech rate, pause durations, n-gram repetitions). The CNN-BiLSTM captures local and long-term dependencies across chunks. Evaluated on Avalinguo and Speechocean762, our approach improves F1-score by 2.8 and Pearson correlation by 6.2 points over single SSL baselines on Speechocean762, with gains of 4.2 F1-score and 4.0 Pearson points on Avalinguo, surpassing Pyannote.audio-based segmentation baselines. These findings highlight chunk-based multi-SSL fusion for robust fluency evaluation, though future work should explore generalization to dialects with irregular prosody.

The article introduces a novel framework, ClusterRCA, designed to address the challenges of network failure diagnosis in high-performance computing systems. Traditional methods are not suitable for HPC due to data heterogeneity and inaccuracy. ClusterRCA utilizes multimodal data from topologically connected NIC pairs to localize culprit nodes and determine failure types accurately. By combining classifier-based and graph-based approaches, it constructs a failure graph based on the state classifier's output and performs a customized random walk to pinpoint the root cause. Experimental results on datasets from a leading global HPC device vendor demonstrate high accuracy in diagnosing network failures and robust performance across various application scenarios. ClusterRCA presents a promising solution for effectively diagnosing network issues in HPC systems. <div>

Abstract: Network failure diagnosis is challenging yet critical for high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Existing methods cannot be directly applied to HPC scenarios due to data heterogeneity and lack of accuracy. This paper proposes a novel framework, called ClusterRCA, to localize culprit nodes and determine failure types by leveraging multimodal data. ClusterRCA extracts features from topologically connected network interface controller (NIC) pairs to analyze the diverse, multimodal data in HPC systems. To accurately localize culprit nodes and determine failure types, ClusterRCA combines classifier-based and graph-based approaches. A failure graph is constructed based on the output of the state classifier, and then it performs a customized random walk on the graph to localize the root cause. Experiments on datasets collected by a top-tier global HPC device vendor show ClusterRCA achieves high accuracy in diagnosing network failure for HPC systems. ClusterRCA also maintains robust performance across different application scenarios.

<div> Keywords: GPU memory bandwidth, Large Language Model, Mixture of Experts, Speculative decoding, Cascade<br />
Summary:<br />
The article discusses the issue of GPU memory bandwidth as a bottleneck for low-latency Large Language Model (LLM) inference and the use of speculative decoding to improve token throughput. While speculative decoding is effective for conventional dense LLMs, it is found to be ineffective for emerging Mixture of Experts (MoE) models due to increased data movement and verification time. The optimal batch size (K) for speculation varies between tasks and models. The Cascade framework is introduced to selectively enable speculation and dynamically adjust K to accelerate MoE serving, based on a utility metric that balances token gains and verification cost. Cascade limits slowdowns to 5% and improves token throughput by 7-14% over static K, making speculative decoding practical for MoE models in various tasks. <div>
arXiv:2506.20675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GPU memory bandwidth is the main bottleneck for low-latency Large Language Model (LLM) inference. Speculative decoding leverages idle GPU compute by using a lightweight drafter to propose K tokens, which the LLM verifies in parallel, boosting token throughput. In conventional dense LLMs, all model weights are fetched each iteration, so speculation adds no latency overhead. Emerging Mixture of Experts (MoE) models activate only a subset of weights per token, greatly reducing data movement. However, we show that speculation is ineffective for MoEs: draft tokens collectively activate more weights, increasing data movement and verification time by 2-3x. When token throughput gains fail to offset this overhead, speculation causes slowdowns up to 1.5x, making it infeasible. Even when useful, the optimal K varies by task, model, and even between requests and iterations. Thus, despite widespread use in dense LLMs, speculation remains impractical in leading MoEs.
  We present Cascade, a utility-driven framework that selectively enables speculation to avoid slowdowns and dynamically tunes K to accelerate MoE serving. Cascade uses a lightweight metric, speculation utility, the ratio of token gains to verification cost, which shows iteration-level locality, enabling periodic decisions via short test and longer set phases. For each request, Cascade disables speculation if utility drops below one during testing, and when utility exceeds one, tests multiple K-values to choose the utility-maximizing K for the set phase. We implement Cascade in vLLM and evaluate it on five popular MoEs with workloads spanning code, math, extraction, and mixed tasks. Cascade limits slowdown to 5% (vs. 1.5x) and improves throughput by 7-14% over static K, making speculative decoding practical for MoEs.

<div> contrastive learning, electrocardiogram, cardiac magnetic resonance, multimodal, cardiac function<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces PTACL, a multimodal contrastive learning framework that enhances electrocardiogram (ECG) representations by integrating spatio-temporal information from cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. PTACL uses a patient-level contrastive loss to align ECG and CMR embeddings, as well as a temporal-level contrastive loss to enforce fine-grained temporal alignment within each patient. By leveraging this approach, PTACL enriches ECG representations with diagnostic information beyond electrical activity, improving performance in retrieving patients with similar cardiac phenotypes and predicting CMR-derived cardiac function parameters. The framework is evaluated on a large dataset from the UK Biobank, demonstrating its potential to enhance non-invasive cardiac diagnostics using ECG data. The code for PTACL is publicly available, enabling further research and application in the field. <div>

Abstract: An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used, cost-effective tool for detecting electrical abnormalities in the heart. However, it cannot directly measure functional parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection fraction, which are crucial for assessing cardiac function. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for these measurements, providing detailed structural and functional insights, but is expensive and less accessible. To bridge this gap, we propose PTACL (Patient and Temporal Alignment Contrastive Learning), a multimodal contrastive learning framework that enhances ECG representations by integrating spatio-temporal information from CMR. PTACL uses global patient-level contrastive loss and local temporal-level contrastive loss. The global loss aligns patient-level representations by pulling ECG and CMR embeddings from the same patient closer together, while pushing apart embeddings from different patients. Local loss enforces fine-grained temporal alignment within each patient by contrasting encoded ECG segments with corresponding encoded CMR frames. This approach enriches ECG representations with diagnostic information beyond electrical activity and transfers more insights between modalities than global alignment alone, all without introducing new learnable weights. We evaluate PTACL on paired ECG-CMR data from 27,951 subjects in the UK Biobank. Compared to baseline approaches, PTACL achieves better performance in two clinically relevant tasks: (1) retrieving patients with similar cardiac phenotypes and (2) predicting CMR-derived cardiac function parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection fraction. Our results highlight the potential of PTACL to enhance non-invasive cardiac diagnostics using ECG. The code is available at: https://github.com/alsalivan/ecgcmr

<div> Federated Learning, Dataset Size Characteristics, SAFL, Modality Performance Hierarchy, Communication Efficiency

Summary:
SAFL is introduced as a progressive training framework for Federated Learning (FL) that considers dataset size characteristics. Experimental evaluation across various datasets and modalities shows an optimal dataset size range of 1000-1500 samples for FL effectiveness. Structured data (e.g., time series, sensor) outperforms unstructured data (e.g., text, multimodal), with structured modalities reaching over 99% accuracy. Performance degradation is observed for large datasets exceeding 2000 samples. SAFL achieves an average accuracy of 87.68% across datasets, with efficient communication reducing total data transfer to 7.38 GB. The framework provides insights into system resource utilization, network efficiency, and training dynamics, bridging gaps in understanding how data characteristics should inform FL strategies for real-world deployments in neural network and learning systems.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for distributed machine learning while preserving data privacy. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on model heterogeneity and aggregation techniques, largely overlooking the fundamental impact of dataset size characteristics on federated training dynamics. This paper introduces Size-Based Adaptive Federated Learning (SAFL), a novel progressive training framework that systematically organizes federated learning based on dataset size characteristics across heterogeneous multi-modal data. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation across 13 diverse datasets spanning 7 modalities (vision, text, time series, audio, sensor, medical vision, and multimodal) reveals critical insights: 1) an optimal dataset size range of 1000-1500 samples for federated learning effectiveness; 2) a clear modality performance hierarchy with structured data (time series, sensor) significantly outperforming unstructured data (text, multimodal); and 3) systematic performance degradation for large datasets exceeding 2000 samples. SAFL achieves an average accuracy of 87.68% across all datasets, with structured data modalities reaching 99%+ accuracy. The framework demonstrates superior communication efficiency, reducing total data transfer to 7.38 GB across 558 communications while maintaining high performance. Our real-time monitoring framework provides unprecedented insights into system resource utilization, network efficiency, and training dynamics. This work fills critical gaps in understanding how data characteristics should drive federated learning strategies, providing both theoretical insights and practical guidance for real-world FL deployments in neural network and learning systems.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence, including deep learning models, will play a transformative role in automated medical image analysis for the diagnosis of cardiac disorders and their management. Automated accurate delineation of cardiac images is the first necessary initial step for the quantification and automated diagnosis of cardiac disorders. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based enhanced UNet model, U-R-Veda, which integrates convolution transformations, vision transformer, residual links, channel-attention, and spatial attention, together with edge-detection based skip-connections for an accurate fully-automated semantic segmentation of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images. The model extracts local-features and their interrelationships using a stack of combination convolution blocks, with embedded channel and spatial attention in the convolution block, and vision transformers. Deep embedding of channel and spatial attention in the convolution block identifies important features and their spatial localization. The combined edge information with channel and spatial attention as skip connection reduces information-loss during convolution transformations. The overall model significantly improves the semantic segmentation of CMR images necessary for improved medical image analysis. An algorithm for the dual attention module (channel and spatial attention) has been presented. Performance results show that U-R-Veda achieves an average accuracy of 95.2%, based on DSC metrics. The model outperforms the accuracy attained by other models, based on DSC and HD metrics, especially for the delineation of right-ventricle and left-ventricle-myocardium.

Summary:<br />
This article explores the use of partial differential equation (PDE) discovery to characterize the dynamics of biological systems across different scales. By combining particle-based simulations with PDE discovery, the framework aims to bridge the gap between micro-scale data and meso-scale dynamics. The study evaluates five PDE discovery methods on simulations of calcium diffusion in astrocytes and finds that several methods accurately capture the diffusion term. This suggests that PDE discovery has the potential to uncover macroscopic dynamics in biological systems from microscopic data. By leveraging PDEs, researchers can better understand the complex behaviors of biological systems and potentially uncover underlying physical principles governing their dynamics. <div>

Abstract: Biological systems are non-linear, include unobserved variables and the physical principles that govern their dynamics are partly unknown. This makes the characterization of their behavior very challenging. Notably, their activity occurs on multiple interdependent spatial and temporal scales that require linking mechanisms across scales. To address the challenge of bridging gaps between scales, we leverage partial differential equations (PDE) discovery. PDE discovery suggests meso-scale dynamics characteristics from micro-scale data. In this article, we present our framework combining particle-based simulations and PDE discovery and conduct preliminary experiments to assess equation discovery in controlled settings. We evaluate five state-of-the-art PDE discovery methods on particle-based simulations of calcium diffusion in astrocytes. The performances of the methods are evaluated on both the form of the discovered equation and the forecasted temporal variations of calcium concentration. Our results show that several methods accurately recover the diffusion term, highlighting the potential of PDE discovery for capturing macroscopic dynamics in biological systems from microscopic data.

<div> Keywords: myocardium biomechanics, finite element simulations, physics-informed neural network, imaged motion consistency, patient-specific modeling

Summary:
The article introduces IMC-PINN-FE, a novel framework for studying the biomechanical behavior of the myocardium. It combines imaged motion consistency with finite element modeling to estimate myocardial stiffness and active tension, enhancing computational efficiency compared to traditional methods. IMC-PINN-FE leverages cardiac motion data from MRI or echocardiography to improve accuracy and speed in patient-specific left ventricular biomechanics analysis. By incorporating motion constraints and back-computation of material properties, it achieves a more precise match with imaged displacements, resulting in a significant improvement in accuracy. This approach eliminates the need for large datasets and enhances patient specificity by reconstructing shape modes from a single subject. IMC-PINN-FE offers a robust and efficient method for rapid and personalized cardiac biomechanical modeling, with potential implications for advancing our understanding of cardiac physiology and improving clinical outcomes. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.20696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elucidating the biomechanical behavior of the myocardium is crucial for understanding cardiac physiology, but cannot be directly inferred from clinical imaging and typically requires finite element (FE) simulations. However, conventional FE methods are computationally expensive and often fail to reproduce observed cardiac motions. We propose IMC-PINN-FE, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework that integrates imaged motion consistency (IMC) with FE modeling for patient-specific left ventricular (LV) biomechanics. Cardiac motion is first estimated from MRI or echocardiography using either a pre-trained attention-based network or an unsupervised cyclic-regularized network, followed by extraction of motion modes. IMC-PINN-FE then rapidly estimates myocardial stiffness and active tension by fitting clinical pressure measurements, accelerating computation from hours to seconds compared to traditional inverse FE. Based on these parameters, it performs FE modeling across the cardiac cycle at 75x speedup. Through motion constraints, it matches imaged displacements more accurately, improving average Dice from 0.849 to 0.927, while preserving realistic pressure-volume behavior. IMC-PINN-FE advances previous PINN-FE models by introducing back-computation of material properties and better motion fidelity. Using motion from a single subject to reconstruct shape modes also avoids the need for large datasets and improves patient specificity. IMC-PINN-FE offers a robust and efficient approach for rapid, personalized, and image-consistent cardiac biomechanical modeling.

<div> tree-based approach, diffusion model, generative modeling, Monte Carlo Tree Search, sample quality

Summary: 
The article introduces Diffusion Tree Sampling (DTS), a tree-based approach for adapting pretrained diffusion models to new objectives at inference time. DTS leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search to reuse information from past computations and improve sample quality. By casting inference-time alignment as a search problem, DTS samples from the reward-aligned target density by propagating rewards back through the diffusion chain. DTS produces asymptotically exact samples in the limit of infinite rollouts, with a variant called Diffusion Tree Search (DTS$^\star$) performing a global search for high reward samples. Experimental results on tasks such as MNIST and CIFAR-10 generation show that DTS matches the performance of baseline methods with significantly less compute. In text-to-image generation and language completion tasks, DTS$^\star$ effectively searches for high reward samples using up to 5 times less compute than traditional methods. The anytime algorithm of DTS efficiently utilizes compute to continually improve sample quality.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.20701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adapting a pretrained diffusion model to new objectives at inference time remains an open problem in generative modeling. Existing steering methods suffer from inaccurate value estimation, especially at high noise levels, which biases guidance. Moreover, information from past runs is not reused to improve sample quality, resulting in inefficient use of compute. Inspired by the success of Monte Carlo Tree Search, we address these limitations by casting inference-time alignment as a search problem that reuses past computations. We introduce a tree-based approach that samples from the reward-aligned target density by propagating terminal rewards back through the diffusion chain and iteratively refining value estimates with each additional generation. Our proposed method, Diffusion Tree Sampling (DTS), produces asymptotically exact samples from the target distribution in the limit of infinite rollouts, and its greedy variant, Diffusion Tree Search (DTS$^\star$), performs a global search for high reward samples. On MNIST and CIFAR-10 class-conditional generation, DTS matches the FID of the best-performing baseline with up to $10\times$ less compute. In text-to-image generation and language completion tasks, DTS$^\star$ effectively searches for high reward samples that match best-of-N with up to $5\times$ less compute. By reusing information from previous generations, we get an anytime algorithm that turns additional compute into steadily better samples, providing a scalable approach for inference-time alignment of diffusion models.

<div> manifold hypothesis, diffusion models, local intrinsic dimension, LID estimator, FLIPD

Summary: 
The article discusses the manifold hypothesis, stating that data in high-dimensional spaces like images lies on low-dimensional submanifolds. Diffusion models (DMs) are effective generative models for learning distributions with low-dimensional support. Previous work linked the local intrinsic dimension (LID) of data in submanifolds to the rate of change of log marginal densities, resulting in the FLIPD LID estimator. The article formally proves the correctness of FLIPD under realistic assumptions, improving on prior work which only did so for affine submanifolds. It also demonstrates that a similar result holds when using uniform convolutions instead of Gaussian ones. The FLIPD estimator has various applications, including quantifying data complexity and detecting outliers or AI-generated text. This work enhances our understanding of LID estimation and the capabilities of diffusion models in capturing low-dimensional structures in data.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.20705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The manifold hypothesis asserts that data of interest in high-dimensional ambient spaces, such as image data, lies on unknown low-dimensional submanifolds. Diffusion models (DMs) -- which operate by convolving data with progressively larger amounts of Gaussian noise and then learning to revert this process -- have risen to prominence as the most performant generative models, and are known to be able to learn distributions with low-dimensional support. For a given datum in one of these submanifolds, we should thus intuitively expect DMs to have implicitly learned its corresponding local intrinsic dimension (LID), i.e. the dimension of the submanifold it belongs to. Kamkari et al. (2024b) recently showed that this is indeed the case by linking this LID to the rate of change of the log marginal densities of the DM with respect to the amount of added noise, resulting in an LID estimator known as FLIPD. LID estimators such as FLIPD have a plethora of uses, among others they quantify the complexity of a given datum, and can be used to detect outliers, adversarial examples and AI-generated text. FLIPD achieves state-of-the-art performance at LID estimation, yet its theoretical underpinnings are incomplete since Kamkari et al. (2024b) only proved its correctness under the highly unrealistic assumption of affine submanifolds. In this work we bridge this gap by formally proving the correctness of FLIPD under realistic assumptions. Additionally, we show that an analogous result holds when Gaussian convolutions are replaced with uniform ones, and discuss the relevance of this result.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in complex reasoning, and test-time scaling techniques can enhance their performance with comparably low cost. Many of these methods have been developed and evaluated on mathematical reasoning benchmarks such as AIME. This paper investigates whether the lessons learned from these benchmarks generalize to the domain of advanced theoretical physics. We evaluate a range of common test-time scaling methods on the TPBench physics dataset and compare their effectiveness with results on AIME. To better leverage the structure of physics problems, we develop a novel, symbolic weak-verifier framework to improve parallel scaling results. Our empirical results demonstrate that this method significantly outperforms existing test-time scaling approaches on TPBench. We also evaluate our method on AIME, confirming its effectiveness in solving advanced mathematical problems. Our findings highlight the power of step-wise symbolic verification for tackling complex scientific problems.

Summary:
The study explores the factors that motivate individuals to help chatbots by examining the influence of chatbot anthropomorphism on human empathy, prosocial behaviors, and intentions. Through an online experiment involving chatbots making mistakes in a collaborative task, it was found that chatbots displaying human-like identity and emotional expression increased participants' prosocial behavior and intentions towards them, with empathy acting as a mediator. Qualitative analysis identified two motivations for prosocial behaviors: empathy for the chatbot and perceiving the chatbot as human-like. The results suggest that enhancing chatbot anthropomorphism can promote positive interactions and support from users, ultimately improving chatbot performance and user well-being. This research contributes to understanding and promoting human prosocial behaviors towards chatbots.

Abstract: Chatbots are increasingly integrated into people's lives and are widely used to help people. Recently, there has also been growing interest in the reverse direction-humans help chatbots-due to a wide range of benefits including better chatbot performance, human well-being, and collaborative outcomes. However, little research has explored the factors that motivate people to help chatbots. To address this gap, we draw on the Computers Are Social Actors (CASA) framework to examine how chatbot anthropomorphism-including human-like identity, emotional expression, and non-verbal expression-influences human empathy toward chatbots and their subsequent prosocial behaviors and intentions. We also explore people's own interpretations of their prosocial behaviors toward chatbots. We conducted an online experiment (N = 244) in which chatbots made mistakes in a collaborative image labeling task and explained the reasons to participants. We then measured participants' prosocial behaviors and intentions toward the chatbots. Our findings revealed that human identity and emotional expression of chatbots increased participants' prosocial behavior and intention toward chatbots, with empathy mediating these effects. Qualitative analysis further identified two motivations for participants' prosocial behaviors: empathy for the chatbot and perceiving the chatbot as human-like. We discuss the implications of these results for understanding and promoting human prosocial behaviors toward chatbots.

Abstract: [Context] Machine learning (ML)-enabled systems are present in our society, driving significant digital transformations. The dynamic nature of ML development, characterized by experimental cycles and rapid changes in data, poses challenges to traditional project management. Agile methods, with their flexibility and incremental delivery, seem well-suited to address this dynamism. However, it is unclear how to effectively apply these methods in the context of ML-enabled systems, where challenges require tailored approaches. [Goal] Our goal is to outline the state of the art in agile management for ML-enabled systems. [Method] We conducted a systematic mapping study using a hybrid search strategy that combines database searches with backward and forward snowballing iterations. [Results] Our study identified 27 papers published between 2008 and 2024. From these, we identified eight frameworks and categorized recommendations and practices into eight key themes, such as Iteration Flexibility, Innovative ML-specific Artifacts, and the Minimal Viable Model. The main challenge identified across studies was accurate effort estimation for ML-related tasks. [Conclusion] This study contributes by mapping the state of the art and identifying open gaps in the field. While relevant work exists, more robust empirical evaluation is still needed to validate these contributions.

The article introduces Stochastic Parameter Decomposition (SPD) as a more scalable and robust method compared to Attribution-based Parameter Decomposition (APD) for decomposing neural network parameters into simpler parts. SPD allows for decomposing larger and more complex models, overcoming issues such as computational cost, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and parameter shrinkage. It also better identifies ground truth mechanisms in toy models, leading to improved interpretability and research possibilities in mechanistic analysis. The method bridges causal mediation analysis and network decomposition, providing a valuable tool for scaling linear parameter decomposition to larger models.

Abstract: A key step in reverse engineering neural networks is to decompose them into simpler parts that can be studied in relative isolation. Linear parameter decomposition -- a framework that has been proposed to resolve several issues with current decomposition methods -- decomposes neural network parameters into a sum of sparsely used vectors in parameter space. However, the current main method in this framework, Attribution-based Parameter Decomposition (APD), is impractical on account of its computational cost and sensitivity to hyperparameters. In this work, we introduce \textit{Stochastic Parameter Decomposition} (SPD), a method that is more scalable and robust to hyperparameters than APD, which we demonstrate by decomposing models that are slightly larger and more complex than was possible to decompose with APD. We also show that SPD avoids other issues, such as shrinkage of the learned parameters, and better identifies ground truth mechanisms in toy models. By bridging causal mediation analysis and network decomposition methods, this demonstration opens up new research possibilities in mechanistic interpretability by removing barriers to scaling linear parameter decomposition methods to larger models. We release a library for running SPD and reproducing our experiments at https://github.com/goodfire-ai/spd.

Summary: <br />
The study evaluates the effectiveness of AI-generated research ideas by comparing them with human-written ideas. Expert researchers executed randomly-assigned ideas, either from experts or an LLM, and wrote short papers documenting their experiments. Review scores from NLP experts showed that LLM-generated ideas scored significantly lower in novelty, excitement, effectiveness, and overall metrics after execution compared to human-written ideas. This highlights the limitations of current LLMs in generating truly effective research ideas. Additionally, a flip in rankings was observed in the aggregated review scores, with human ideas often scoring higher than LLM ideas. The gap between LLM and human ideas observed at the ideation stage underscores the challenge of evaluating research ideas without execution outcomes. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the scientific research pipeline. A key capability for this process is the ability to generate novel research ideas, and prior studies have found settings in which LLM-generated research ideas were judged as more novel than human-expert ideas. However, a good idea should not simply appear to be novel, it should also result in better research after being executed. To test whether AI-generated ideas lead to better research outcomes, we conduct an execution study by recruiting 43 expert researchers to execute randomly-assigned ideas, either written by experts or generated by an LLM. Each expert spent over 100 hours implementing the idea and wrote a 4-page short paper to document the experiments. All the executed projects are then reviewed blindly by expert NLP researchers. Comparing the review scores of the same ideas before and after execution, the scores of the LLM-generated ideas decrease significantly more than expert-written ideas on all evaluation metrics (novelty, excitement, effectiveness, and overall; p < 0.05), closing the gap between LLM and human ideas observed at the ideation stage. When comparing the aggregated review scores from the execution study, we even observe that for many metrics there is a flip in rankings where human ideas score higher than LLM ideas. This ideation-execution gap highlights the limitations of current LLMs in generating truly effective research ideas and the challenge of evaluating research ideas in the absence of execution outcomes.

Summary: 
This study explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the resilience and generalization of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). By incorporating LLM analysis as simulated cybersecurity expert agents in the detection pipeline, suspicious or adversarially perturbed elements in network flow data can be identified and potentially mitigated before GNN processing. Through comprehensive experiments with various real-world adversarial attacks, including those gathered from physical testbed experiments, the study demonstrates that integrating LLM analysis can significantly improve the robustness of GNN-based NIDS. The results suggest that LLM agents can serve as a valuable additional layer in intrusion detection architectures, offering enhanced protection against evolving cybersecurity threats in IoT environments.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) show great promise for Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), particularly in IoT environments, but suffer performance degradation due to distribution drift and lack robustness against realistic adversarial attacks. Current robustness evaluations often rely on unrealistic synthetic perturbations and lack demonstrations on systematic analysis of different kinds of adversarial attack, which encompass both black-box and white-box scenarios. This work proposes a novel approach to enhance GNN robustness and generalization by employing Large Language Models (LLMs) in an agentic pipeline as simulated cybersecurity expert agents. These agents scrutinize graph structures derived from network flow data, identifying and potentially mitigating suspicious or adversarially perturbed elements before GNN processing. Our experiments, using a framework designed for realistic evaluation and testing with a variety of adversarial attacks including a dataset collected from physical testbed experiments, demonstrate that integrating LLM analysis can significantly improve the resilience of GNN-based NIDS against challenges, showcasing the potential of LLM agent as a complementary layer in intrusion detection architectures.

Abstract: Optimizing GPU kernels for high performance is a complex task, often demanding deep architectural knowledge, extensive profiling, and iterative experimentation. This challenge is amplified when targeting newer or less-documented GPU architectures where traditional development aids are scarce. This paper introduces an LLM-powered "GPU Kernel Scientist," an automated methodology for iteratively refining accelerator kernels.
  Our methodology employs LLMs in a multi-stage, evolutionary process: (a) strategically selecting promising prior code versions as a basis for new iterations; (b) generating hypotheses for optimization experiments, based on existing code and assimilated knowledge from general GPU literature; and (c) autonomously implementing these experiments through code modification and subsequent submission to an external evaluation system, using only observed timing data as performance feedback. We detail how this approach navigates the challenges of the AMD MI300 target architecture and leverages LLMs to compensate for limited domain-specific human expertise.
  Since quantitative results from an ongoing performance competition were embargoed on paper submission date, we present the architectural design, operational workflow, and qualitative insights, highlighting the potential of LLM-driven agents to democratise and accelerate GPU kernel optimization, especially in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving hardware environments.

<div> Keywords: Recurrent Neural Networks, LSTMs, FPGA, Acceleration, Quantisation

Summary: 
Recurrent neural networks, particularly LSTMs, are effective for time-series tasks like sentiment analysis and stock prediction, but their computational complexity limits real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments. Existing FPGA acceleration tools focus on feed-forward networks, requiring custom implementations for LSTMs. This paper presents a solution using the FINN framework to deploy LSTMs on FPGAs. By using the ONNX Scan operator to model LSTM computations, mixed quantisation is supported, enabling functional verification of models. Custom transformations in the FINN compiler map the quantised ONNX graph to hardware blocks, achieving a balance between performance and resource consumption. The proposed tool-flow is validated by training a quantised ConvLSTM model for stock prediction, generating a hardware IP for the XCZU7EV device. The generated accelerator matches or betters state-of-the-art model accuracy with reduced precision, paving the way for resource-efficient RNN accelerator designs on FPGAs.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), particularly LSTMs, are effective for time-series tasks like sentiment analysis and short-term stock prediction. However, their computational complexity poses challenges for real-time deployment in resource constrained environments. While FPGAs offer a promising platform for energy-efficient AI acceleration, existing tools mainly target feed-forward networks, and LSTM acceleration typically requires full custom implementation. In this paper, we address this gap by leveraging the open-source and extensible FINN framework to enable the generalized deployment of LSTMs on FPGAs. Specifically, we leverage the Scan operator from the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) specification to model the recurrent nature of LSTM computations, enabling support for mixed quantisation within them and functional verification of LSTM-based models. Furthermore, we introduce custom transformations within the FINN compiler to map the quantised ONNX computation graph to hardware blocks from the HLS kernel library of the FINN compiler and Vitis HLS. We validate the proposed tool-flow by training a quantised ConvLSTM model for a mid-price stock prediction task using the widely used dataset and generating a corresponding hardware IP of the model using our flow, targeting the XCZU7EV device. We show that the generated quantised ConvLSTM accelerator through our flow achieves a balance between performance (latency) and resource consumption, while matching (or bettering) inference accuracy of state-of-the-art models with reduced precision. We believe that the generalisable nature of the proposed flow will pave the way for resource-efficient RNN accelerator designs on FPGAs.

<div> Keywords: financial documents, multimodal extraction, retrieval-augmented generation, MultiFinRAG, cross-modal reasoning

Summary: 
MultiFinRAG is a framework designed for financial question answering that can handle diverse modalities like text, tables, and images. It employs a multimodal extraction process using a lightweight multimodal large language model to produce structured outputs and textual summaries. These outputs are indexed with modality-aware similarity thresholds for accurate retrieval. The framework utilizes a tiered fallback strategy to dynamically escalate from text-only to text+table+image contexts for cross-modal reasoning while reducing irrelevant context. Despite running on standard hardware, MultiFinRAG outperforms ChatGPT-4o in accuracy by 19 percentage points on complex financial QA tasks. <div>

Abstract: Financial documents--such as 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and investor presentations--span hundreds of pages and combine diverse modalities, including dense narrative text, structured tables, and complex figures. Answering questions over such content often requires joint reasoning across modalities, which strains traditional large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines due to token limitations, layout loss, and fragmented cross-modal context. We introduce MultiFinRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework purpose-built for financial QA. MultiFinRAG first performs multimodal extraction by grouping table and figure images into batches and sending them to a lightweight, quantized open-source multimodal LLM, which produces both structured JSON outputs and concise textual summaries. These outputs, along with narrative text, are embedded and indexed with modality-aware similarity thresholds for precise retrieval. A tiered fallback strategy then dynamically escalates from text-only to text+table+image contexts when necessary, enabling cross-modal reasoning while reducing irrelevant context. Despite running on commodity hardware, MultiFinRAG achieves 19 percentage points higher accuracy than ChatGPT-4o (free-tier) on complex financial QA tasks involving text, tables, images, and combined multimodal reasoning.

Summary:<br /><br />Large language models (LLMs) are being used to detect and respond to violent content online. However, their ability to understand and respond to morally ambiguous real-world scenarios is not well understood. In this study, six different LLMs were evaluated using the Violent Behavior Vignette Questionnaire (VBVQ), a validated social science instrument. The study found that LLMs often generate text that suggests violent responses, even though their internal preferences may differ. Additionally, the study revealed that LLMs' tendencies towards violence vary based on demographics such as race, age, and geographic identity within the United States. These findings highlight the need for further research on the potential biases in LLMs and their implications for automated systems used in detecting and responding to violent content online.<br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for detecting and responding to violent content online, yet their ability to reason about morally ambiguous, real-world scenarios remains underexamined. We present the first study to evaluate LLMs using a validated social science instrument designed to measure human response to everyday conflict, namely the Violent Behavior Vignette Questionnaire (VBVQ). To assess potential bias, we introduce persona-based prompting that varies race, age, and geographic identity within the United States. Six LLMs developed across different geopolitical and organizational contexts are evaluated under a unified zero-shot setting. Our study reveals two key findings: (1) LLMs surface-level text generation often diverges from their internal preference for violent responses; (2) their violent tendencies vary across demographics, frequently contradicting established findings in criminology, social science, and psychology.

<div> framework, super-resolution, trustworthiness, vision-language models, diffusion <br />
Summary: 
This paper presents a robust and automated framework for identifying the most trustworthy super-resolution (SR) sample from a diffusion-generated set using vision-language models (VLMs). The VLMs are prompted with structured queries to assess semantic correctness, visual quality, and artifact presence, and the top-ranked SR candidates are ensembled to produce a single trustworthy output. A novel Trustworthiness Score (TWS) metric is introduced to quantify SR reliability based on semantic similarity, structural integrity, and artifact sensitivity. The study shows that TWS correlates strongly with human preference for both ambiguous and natural images, and VLM-guided selections consistently yield high TWS values. This approach provides a principled, scalable, and generalizable solution for navigating the uncertainty of the diffusion SR space, aligning outputs with human expectations and semantic correctness, and setting a new benchmark for trustworthiness in generative SR. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) is an ill-posed inverse problem with many feasible solutions consistent with a given low-resolution image. On one hand, regressive SR models aim to balance fidelity and perceptual quality to yield a single solution, but this trade-off often introduces artifacts that create ambiguity in information-critical applications such as recognizing digits or letters. On the other hand, diffusion models generate a diverse set of SR images, but selecting the most trustworthy solution from this set remains a challenge. This paper introduces a robust, automated framework for identifying the most trustworthy SR sample from a diffusion-generated set by leveraging the semantic reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, VLMs such as BLIP-2, GPT-4o, and their variants are prompted with structured queries to assess semantic correctness, visual quality, and artifact presence. The top-ranked SR candidates are then ensembled to yield a single trustworthy output in a cost-effective manner. To rigorously assess the validity of VLM-selected samples, we propose a novel Trustworthiness Score (TWS) a hybrid metric that quantifies SR reliability based on three complementary components: semantic similarity via CLIP embeddings, structural integrity using SSIM on edge maps, and artifact sensitivity through multi-level wavelet decomposition. We empirically show that TWS correlates strongly with human preference in both ambiguous and natural images, and that VLM-guided selections consistently yield high TWS values. Compared to conventional metrics like PSNR, LPIPS, which fail to reflect information fidelity, our approach offers a principled, scalable, and generalizable solution for navigating the uncertainty of the diffusion SR space. By aligning outputs with human expectations and semantic correctness, this work sets a new benchmark for trustworthiness in generative SR.

<br />Summary:
The study introduces FixCLR, a semi-supervised domain generalization method that utilizes contrastive learning for explicit domain invariance regularization. FixCLR leverages class information from pseudo-labels and utilizes a repelling term to enhance domain generalization. It can be added to existing SSDG and semi-supervised methods for improved performance. The research includes comprehensive experiments exploring various improvements to semi-supervised methods, comparing pretrained and non-pretrained models, and testing on datasets with multiple domains. FixCLR proves to be effective in enhancing SSDG performance, particularly when combined with other semi-supervised techniques. <div>

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) aims to solve the problem of generalizing to out-of-distribution data when only a few labels are available. Due to label scarcity, applying domain generalization methods often underperform. Consequently, existing SSDG methods combine semi-supervised learning methods with various regularization terms. However, these methods do not explicitly regularize to learn domains invariant representations across all domains, which is a key goal for domain generalization. To address this, we introduce FixCLR. Inspired by success in self-supervised learning, we change two crucial components to adapt contrastive learning for explicit domain invariance regularization: utilization of class information from pseudo-labels and using only a repelling term. FixCLR can also be added on top of most existing SSDG and semi-supervised methods for complementary performance improvements. Our research includes extensive experiments that have not been previously explored in SSDG studies. These experiments include benchmarking different improvements to semi-supervised methods, evaluating the performance of pretrained versus non-pretrained models, and testing on datasets with many domains. Overall, FixCLR proves to be an effective SSDG method, especially when combined with other semi-supervised methods.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.20851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As data and knowledge expand rapidly, adopting systematic methodologies for ontology generation has become crucial. With the daily increases in data volumes and frequent content changes, the demand for databases to store and retrieve information for the creation of knowledge graphs has become increasingly urgent. The previously established Knowledge Acquisition and Representation Methodology (KNARM) outlines a systematic approach to address these challenges and create knowledge graphs. However, following this methodology highlights the existing challenge of seamlessly integrating Neo4j databases with the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Previous attempts to integrate data from Neo4j into an ontology have been discussed, but these approaches often require an understanding of description logics (DL) syntax, which may not be familiar to many users. Thus, a more accessible method is necessary to bridge this gap. This paper presents a user-friendly approach that utilizes Python and its rdflib library to support ontology development. We showcase our novel approach through a Neo4j database we created by integrating data from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. Using this dataset, we developed a Python script that automatically generates the required classes and their axioms, facilitating a smoother integration process. This approach offers a practical solution to the challenges of ontology generation in the context of rapidly growing adverse drug event datasets, supporting improved drug safety monitoring and public health decision-making.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are emerging as a key approach for grounding Large Language Models (LLMs) in external knowledge, addressing limitations in factual accuracy and contextual relevance. However, there is a lack of empirical studies that report on the development of RAG-based implementations grounded in real-world use cases, evaluated through general user involvement, and accompanied by systematic documentation of lessons learned. This paper presents five domain-specific RAG applications developed for real-world scenarios across governance, cybersecurity, agriculture, industrial research, and medical diagnostics. Each system incorporates multilingual OCR, semantic retrieval via vector embeddings, and domain-adapted LLMs, deployed through local servers or cloud APIs to meet distinct user needs. A web-based evaluation involving a total of 100 participants assessed the systems across six dimensions: (i) Ease of Use, (ii) Relevance, (iii) Transparency, (iv) Responsiveness, (v) Accuracy, and (vi) Likelihood of Recommendation. Based on user feedback and our development experience, we documented twelve key lessons learned, highlighting technical, operational, and ethical challenges affecting the reliability and usability of RAG systems in practice.

<div> RGB pixels, monocular depth estimation, explicit cues, cue-aware pipeline, cortical hierarchy

Summary: 
The study introduces ThirdEye, a novel approach for monocular depth estimation that incorporates explicit cues such as occlusion boundaries, shading, and perspective. Unlike traditional methods that rely on implicit learning from RGB pixels alone, ThirdEye leverages pre-trained cue experts in a three-stage cortical hierarchy (V1->V2->V3) equipped with a key-value working-memory module to weight cues by reliability. An adaptive-bins transformer head then generates a high-resolution disparity map. By using frozen cue experts, ThirdEye benefits from external supervision and requires minimal fine-tuning. The approach is motivated by neuroscientific principles and offers additional architectural details and an expanded experimental protocol. Quantitative results will be reported in a future revision.  <div>

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation methods traditionally train deep models to infer depth directly from RGB pixels. This implicit learning often overlooks explicit monocular cues that the human visual system relies on, such as occlusion boundaries, shading, and perspective. Rather than expecting a network to discover these cues unaided, we present ThirdEye, a cue-aware pipeline that deliberately supplies each cue through specialised, pre-trained, and frozen networks. These cues are fused in a three-stage cortical hierarchy (V1->V2->V3) equipped with a key-value working-memory module that weights them by reliability. An adaptive-bins transformer head then produces a high-resolution disparity map. Because the cue experts are frozen, ThirdEye inherits large amounts of external supervision while requiring only modest fine-tuning. This extended version provides additional architectural detail, neuroscientific motivation, and an expanded experimental protocol; quantitative results will appear in a future revision.

Summary:
This paper presents a framework for developing complex model transformation sequences using reinforcement learning (RL) guided by human advice. The framework maps user-defined model transformations to RL primitives, allowing the autonomous agent to explore the state space and identify optimal sequences. Human guidance, even if uncertain, significantly improves RL performance and accelerates the development of complex transformations. By balancing the certainty and timeliness of human advice, the method demonstrates a step towards RL-driven human-in-the-loop engineering methods. The approach addresses challenges in model synchronization, automated repair, and design space exploration that require extensive MT sequences. The evaluation shows the effectiveness of combining RL with human input for efficient and error-free development of complex model transformations. <div>

Abstract: Model-driven engineering problems often require complex model transformations (MTs), i.e., MTs that are chained in extensive sequences. Pertinent examples of such problems include model synchronization, automated model repair, and design space exploration. Manually developing complex MTs is an error-prone and often infeasible process. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an apt way to alleviate these issues. In RL, an autonomous agent explores the state space through trial and error to identify beneficial sequences of actions, such as MTs. However, RL methods exhibit performance issues in complex problems. In these situations, human guidance can be of high utility. In this paper, we present an approach and technical framework for developing complex MT sequences through RL, guided by potentially uncertain human advice. Our framework allows user-defined MTs to be mapped onto RL primitives, and executes them as RL programs to find optimal MT sequences. Our evaluation shows that human guidance, even if uncertain, substantially improves RL performance, and results in more efficient development of complex MTs. Through a trade-off between the certainty and timeliness of human advice, our method takes a step towards RL-driven human-in-the-loop engineering methods.

Abstract: As the deployment of large language models (LLMs) grows in sensitive domains, ensuring the integrity of their computational provenance becomes a critical challenge, particularly in regulated sectors such as healthcare, where strict requirements are applied in dataset usage. We introduce ZKPROV, a novel cryptographic framework that enables zero-knowledge proofs of LLM provenance. It allows users to verify that a model is trained on a reliable dataset without revealing sensitive information about it or its parameters. Unlike prior approaches that focus on complete verification of the training process (incurring significant computational cost) or depend on trusted execution environments, ZKPROV offers a distinct balance. Our method cryptographically binds a trained model to its authorized training dataset(s) through zero-knowledge proofs while avoiding proof of every training step. By leveraging dataset-signed metadata and compact model parameter commitments, ZKPROV provides sound and privacy-preserving assurances that the result of the LLM is derived from a model trained on the claimed authorized and relevant dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the ZKPROV in generating this proof and verifying it, achieving a practical solution for real-world deployments. We also provide formal security guarantees, proving that our approach preserves dataset confidentiality while ensuring trustworthy dataset provenance.

This thesis addresses the challenge of efficiently adapting language models (LMs) to specific tasks in NLP. The proposed methods include extracting task-relevant knowledge from unlabelled data, introducing continued pre-training techniques, and implementing parameter-efficient fine-tuning to reduce computational costs. Improved supervised fine-tuning methods enhance LM performance, especially when labelled data is limited. New evaluation methods like multi-hop spatial reasoning tasks are developed to assess LM capabilities more comprehensively. Empirical studies across various NLP tasks show that these approaches significantly improve LM robustness, efficiency, and generalization, making them more adaptable to a wide range of applications. These advancements bring us closer to the goal of artificial general intelligence.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in NLP, yet adapting them efficiently and robustly to specific tasks remains challenging. As their scale and complexity grow, fine-tuning LMs on labelled data often underutilizes available unlabelled data, leads to overfitting on small task-specific sets, and imposes significant computational costs. These limitations hamper their application to the open-ended landscape of real-world language tasks.
  This thesis proposes a series of methods to better adapt LMs to downstream applications. First, we explore strategies for extracting task-relevant knowledge from unlabelled data, introducing a novel continued pre-training technique that outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches. Next, we present a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that substantially reduces memory and compute costs while maintaining competitive performance. We also introduce improved supervised fine-tuning methods that enable LMs to better follow instructions, especially when labelled data is scarce, enhancing their performance across a range of NLP tasks, including open-ended generation. Finally, we develop new evaluation methods and benchmarks, such as multi-hop spatial reasoning tasks, to assess LM capabilities and adaptation more comprehensively.
  Through extensive empirical studies across diverse NLP tasks, our results demonstrate that these approaches substantially improve LM robustness, efficiency, and generalization, making them more adaptable to a broad range of applications. These advances mark a significant step towards more robust and efficient LMs, bringing us closer to the goal of artificial general intelligence.

<div> optimization, large language model, autonomous framework, process constraints, computational efficiency  
Summary:  
An autonomous framework utilizing large language model (LLM) agents for chemical process optimization is introduced to address the challenges of ill-defined operating constraints. The framework, named AutoGen, employs specialized agents for constraint generation, parameter validation, simulation execution, and optimization guidance, eliminating the need for predefined operational bounds. Through autonomous constraint generation and collaborative optimization guided by LLM agents, the framework demonstrated competitive performance with conventional methods but with better computational efficiency. Validated on the hydrodealkylation process, the framework showed a 31-fold speedup over grid search, converging in under 20 minutes. The reasoning-guided search highlighted sophisticated process understanding by identifying utility trade-offs and applying domain-informed heuristics. This approach holds promise for optimization scenarios where operational constraints are poorly characterized or unavailable, especially for emerging processes and retrofit applications.

Abstract: Chemical process optimization is crucial to maximize production efficiency and economic performance. Traditional methods, including gradient-based solvers, evolutionary algorithms, and parameter grid searches, become impractical when operating constraints are ill-defined or unavailable, requiring engineers to rely on subjective heuristics to estimate feasible parameter ranges. To address this constraint definition bottleneck, we present a multi-agent framework of large language model (LLM) agents that autonomously infer operating constraints from minimal process descriptions, then collaboratively guide optimization using the inferred constraints. Our AutoGen-based agentic framework employs OpenAI's o3 model, with specialized agents for constraint generation, parameter validation, simulation execution, and optimization guidance. Through two phases - autonomous constraint generation using embedded domain knowledge, followed by iterative multi-agent optimization - the framework eliminates the need for predefined operational bounds. Validated on the hydrodealkylation process across cost, yield, and yield-to-cost ratio metrics, the framework demonstrated competitive performance with conventional optimization methods while achieving better computational efficiency, requiring fewer iterations to converge. Our approach converged in under 20 minutes, achieving a 31-fold speedup over grid search. Beyond computational efficiency, the framework's reasoning-guided search demonstrates sophisticated process understanding, correctly identifying utility trade-offs, and applying domain-informed heuristics. This approach shows significant potential for optimization scenarios where operational constraints are poorly characterized or unavailable, particularly for emerging processes and retrofit applications.

<div> Sparse rule ensembles, symbolic rules, interpretability, logical propositions, gradient boosting <br />
<br />
Summary: This study introduces a new approach to rule ensembles by incorporating logical propositions with learnable sparse linear transformations of input variables. This allows decision regions to be defined as general polytopes with oblique faces, enhancing model interpretability. The proposed learning method uses sequential greedy optimization based on iteratively reweighted logistic regression. Experimental results show that this method can construct rule ensembles with similar test risk as state-of-the-art methods but significantly reduces model complexity across various benchmark datasets. <div>

Abstract: Small additive ensembles of symbolic rules offer interpretable prediction models. Traditionally, these ensembles use rule conditions based on conjunctions of simple threshold propositions $x \geq t$ on a single input variable $x$ and threshold $t$, resulting geometrically in axis-parallel polytopes as decision regions. While this form ensures a high degree of interpretability for individual rules and can be learned efficiently using the gradient boosting approach, it relies on having access to a curated set of expressive and ideally independent input features so that a small ensemble of axis-parallel regions can describe the target variable well. Absent such features, reaching sufficient accuracy requires increasing the number and complexity of individual rules, which diminishes the interpretability of the model. Here, we extend classical rule ensembles by introducing logical propositions with learnable sparse linear transformations of input variables, i.e., propositions of the form $\mathbf{x}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{w} \geq t$, where $\mathbf{w}$ is a learnable sparse weight vector, enabling decision regions as general polytopes with oblique faces. We propose a learning method using sequential greedy optimization based on an iteratively reweighted formulation of logistic regression. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method efficiently constructs rule ensembles with the same test risk as state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing model complexity across ten benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Current texture synthesis methods, which generate textures from fixed viewpoints, suffer from inconsistencies due to the lack of global context and geometric understanding. Meanwhile, recent advancements in video generation models have demonstrated remarkable success in achieving temporally consistent videos. In this paper, we introduce VideoTex, a novel framework for seamless texture synthesis that leverages video generation models to address both spatial and temporal inconsistencies in 3D textures. Our approach incorporates geometry-aware conditions, enabling precise utilization of 3D mesh structures. Additionally, we propose a structure-wise UV diffusion strategy, which enhances the generation of occluded areas by preserving semantic information, resulting in smoother and more coherent textures. VideoTex not only achieves smoother transitions across UV boundaries but also ensures high-quality, temporally stable textures across video frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VideoTex outperforms existing methods in texture fidelity, seam blending, and stability, paving the way for dynamic real-time applications that demand both visual quality and temporal coherence.

Abstract: Antibody design remains a critical challenge in therapeutic and diagnostic development, particularly for complex antigens with diverse binding interfaces. Current computational methods face two main limitations: (1) capturing geometric features while preserving symmetries, and (2) generalizing novel antigen interfaces. Despite recent advancements, these methods often fail to accurately capture molecular interactions and maintain structural integrity. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{AbMEGD}, an end-to-end framework integrating \textbf{M}ulti-scale \textbf{E}quivariant \textbf{G}raph \textbf{D}iffusion for antibody sequence and structure co-design. Leveraging advanced geometric deep learning, AbMEGD combines atomic-level geometric features with residue-level embeddings, capturing local atomic details and global sequence-structure interactions. Its E(3)-equivariant diffusion method ensures geometric precision, computational efficiency, and robust generalizability for complex antigens. Furthermore, experiments using the SAbDab database demonstrate a 10.13\% increase in amino acid recovery, 3.32\% rise in improvement percentage, and a 0.062~\AA\ reduction in root mean square deviation within the critical CDR-H3 region compared to DiffAb, a leading antibody design model. These results highlight AbMEGD's ability to balance structural integrity with improved functionality, establishing a new benchmark for sequence-structure co-design and affinity optimization.

Abstract: Pathology is experiencing rapid digital transformation driven by whole-slide imaging and artificial intelligence (AI). While deep learning-based computational pathology has achieved notable success, traditional models primarily focus on image analysis without integrating natural language instruction or rich, text-based context. Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in computational pathology face limitations, including insufficient training data, inadequate support and evaluation for multi-image understanding, and a lack of autonomous, diagnostic reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce PathChat+, a new MLLM specifically designed for human pathology, trained on over 1 million diverse, pathology-specific instruction samples and nearly 5.5 million question answer turns. Extensive evaluations across diverse pathology benchmarks demonstrated that PathChat+ substantially outperforms the prior PathChat copilot, as well as both state-of-the-art (SOTA) general-purpose and other pathology-specific models. Furthermore, we present SlideSeek, a reasoning-enabled multi-agent AI system leveraging PathChat+ to autonomously evaluate gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs) through iterative, hierarchical diagnostic reasoning, reaching high accuracy on DDxBench, a challenging open-ended differential diagnosis benchmark, while also capable of generating visually grounded, humanly-interpretable summary reports.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models extend vision-language models (VLM) by integrating action generation modules for robotic manipulation. Leveraging strengths of VLM in vision perception and instruction understanding, VLA models exhibit promising generalization across diverse manipulation tasks. However, applications demanding high precision and accuracy reveal performance gaps without further adaptation. Evidence from multiple domains highlights the critical role of post-training to align foundational models with downstream applications, spurring extensive research on post-training VLA models. VLA model post-training aims to address the challenge of improving an embodiment's ability to interact with the environment for the given tasks, analogous to the process of humans motor skills acquisition. Accordingly, this paper reviews post-training strategies for VLA models through the lens of human motor learning, focusing on three dimensions: environments, embodiments, and tasks. A structured taxonomy is introduced aligned with human learning mechanisms: (1) enhancing environmental perception, (2) improving embodiment awareness, (3) deepening task comprehension, and (4) multi-component integration. Finally, key challenges and trends in post-training VLA models are identified, establishing a conceptual framework to guide future research. This work delivers both a comprehensive overview of current VLA model post-training methods from a human motor learning perspective and practical insights for VLA model development.

Abstract: The advent of Video Diffusion Transformers (Video DiTs) marks a milestone in video generation. However, directly applying existing video editing methods to Video DiTs often incurs substantial computational overhead, due to resource-intensive attention modification or finetuning. To alleviate this problem, we present DFVEdit, an efficient zero-shot video editing method tailored for Video DiTs. DFVEdit eliminates the need for both attention modification and fine-tuning by directly operating on clean latents via flow transformation. To be more specific, we observe that editing and sampling can be unified under the continuous flow perspective. Building upon this foundation, we propose the Conditional Delta Flow Vector (CDFV) -- a theoretically unbiased estimation of DFV -- and integrate Implicit Cross Attention (ICA) guidance as well as Embedding Reinforcement (ER) to further enhance editing quality. DFVEdit excels in practical efficiency, offering at least 20x inference speed-up and 85\% memory reduction on Video DiTs compared to attention-engineering-based editing methods. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that DFVEdit can be seamlessly applied to popular Video DiTs (e.g., CogVideoX and Wan2.1), attaining state-of-the-art performance on structural fidelity, spatial-temporal consistency, and editing quality.

<title>From Cradle to Cane: A Two-Pass Framework for High-Fidelity Lifespan Face Aging</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20977</link>

Abstract: Face aging has become a crucial task in computer vision, with applications ranging from entertainment to healthcare. However, existing methods struggle with achieving a realistic and seamless transformation across the entire lifespan, especially when handling large age gaps or extreme head poses. The core challenge lies in balancing age accuracy and identity preservation--what we refer to as the Age-ID trade-off. Most prior methods either prioritize age transformation at the expense of identity consistency or vice versa. In this work, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named Cradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The first pass focuses on solving age accuracy by introducing an adaptive noise injection (AdaNI) mechanism. This mechanism is guided by including prompt descriptions of age and gender for the given person as the textual condition. Also, by adjusting the noise level, we can control the strength of aging while allowing more flexibility in transforming the face. However, identity preservation is weakly ensured here to facilitate stronger age transformations. In the second pass, we enhance identity preservation while maintaining age-specific features by conditioning the model on two identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb): SVR-ArcFace and Rotate-CLIP. This pass allows for denoising the transformed image from the first pass, ensuring stronger identity preservation without compromising the aging accuracy. Both passes are jointly trained in an end-to-end way. Extensive experiments on the CelebA-HQ test dataset, evaluated through Face++ and Qwen-VL protocols, show that our Cradle2Cane outperforms existing face aging methods in age accuracy and identity consistency.

<title>Enhancing Homophily-Heterophily Separation: Relation-Aware Learning in Heterogeneous Graphs</title>

Abstract: Real-world networks usually have a property of node heterophily, that is, the connected nodes usually have different features or different labels. This heterophily issue has been extensively studied in homogeneous graphs but remains under-explored in heterogeneous graphs, where there are multiple types of nodes and edges. Capturing node heterophily in heterogeneous graphs is very challenging since both node/edge heterogeneity and node heterophily should be carefully taken into consideration. Existing methods typically convert heterogeneous graphs into homogeneous ones to learn node heterophily, which will inevitably lose the potential heterophily conveyed by heterogeneous relations. To bridge this gap, we propose Relation-Aware Separation of Homophily and Heterophily (RASH), a novel contrastive learning framework that explicitly models high-order semantics of heterogeneous interactions and adaptively separates homophilic and heterophilic patterns. Particularly, RASH introduces dual heterogeneous hypergraphs to encode multi-relational bipartite subgraphs and dynamically constructs homophilic graphs and heterophilic graphs based on relation importance. A multi-relation contrastive loss is designed to align heterogeneous and homophilic/heterophilic views by maximizing mutual information. In this way, RASH simultaneously resolves the challenges of heterogeneity and heterophily in heterogeneous graphs. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of RASH across various downstream tasks. The code is available at: https://github.com/zhengziyu77/RASH.

Abstract: Pathology image segmentation is crucial in computational pathology for analyzing histological features relevant to cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, current methods face major challenges in clinical applications due to limited annotated data and restricted category definitions. To address these limitations, we propose PathSegmentor, the first text-prompted segmentation foundation model designed specifically for pathology images. We also introduce PathSeg , the largest and most comprehensive dataset for pathology segmentation, built from 17 public sources and containing 275k image-mask-label triples across 160 diverse categories. With PathSegmentor, users can perform semantic segmentation using natural language prompts, eliminating the need for laborious spatial inputs such as points or boxes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PathSegmentor outperforms specialized models with higher accuracy and broader applicability, while maintaining a compact architecture. It significantly surpasses existing spatial- and text-prompted models by 0.145 and 0.429 in overall Dice scores, respectively, showing strong robustness in segmenting complex structures and generalizing to external datasets. Moreover, PathSegmentor's outputs enhance the interpretability of diagnostic models through feature importance estimation and imaging biomarker discovery, offering pathologists evidence-based support for clinical decision-making. This work advances the development of explainable AI in precision oncology.

<title>SAC: A Framework for Measuring and Inducing Personality Traits in LLMs with Dynamic Intensity Control</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant traction across a wide range of fields in recent years. There is also a growing expectation for them to display human-like personalities during interactions. To meet this expectation, numerous studies have proposed methods for modelling LLM personalities through psychometric evaluations. However, most existing models face two major limitations: they rely on the Big Five (OCEAN) framework, which only provides coarse personality dimensions, and they lack mechanisms for controlling trait intensity. In this paper, we address this gap by extending the Machine Personality Inventory (MPI), which originally used the Big Five model, to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, allowing expressive control over sixteen distinct traits. We also developed a structured framework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and dynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. Our method introduces adjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and leverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors: \textit{Frequency}, \textit{Depth}, \textit{Threshold}, \textit{Effort}, and \textit{Willingness}. Through experimentation, we find that modelling intensity as a continuous spectrum yields substantially more consistent and controllable personality expression compared to binary trait toggling. Moreover, we observe that changes in target trait intensity systematically influence closely related traits in psychologically coherent directions, suggesting that LLMs internalize multi-dimensional personality structures rather than treating traits in isolation. Our work opens new pathways for controlled and nuanced human-machine interactions in domains such as healthcare, education, and interviewing processes, bringing us one step closer to truly human-like social machines.

<title>Multimodal Prompt Alignment for Facial Expression Recognition</title>

Abstract: Prompt learning has been widely adopted to efficiently adapt vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP for various downstream tasks. Despite their success, current VLM-based facial expression recognition (FER) methods struggle to capture fine-grained textual-visual relationships, which are essential for distinguishing subtle differences between facial expressions. To address this challenge, we propose a multimodal prompt alignment framework for FER, called MPA-FER, that provides fine-grained semantic guidance to the learning process of prompted visual features, resulting in more precise and interpretable representations. Specifically, we introduce a multi-granularity hard prompt generation strategy that utilizes a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT to generate detailed descriptions for each facial expression. The LLM-based external knowledge is injected into the soft prompts by minimizing the feature discrepancy between the soft prompts and the hard prompts. To preserve the generalization abilities of the pretrained CLIP model, our approach incorporates prototype-guided visual feature alignment, ensuring that the prompted visual features from the frozen image encoder align closely with class-specific prototypes. Additionally, we propose a cross-modal global-local alignment module that focuses on expression-relevant facial features, further improving the alignment between textual and visual features. Extensive experiments demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three FER benchmark datasets, while retaining the benefits of the pretrained model and minimizing computational costs.

Abstract: Advanced intelligent systems, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), are significantly reshaping financial practices through advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, the extent to which these models effectively capture and apply domain-specific financial knowledge remains uncertain. Addressing a critical gap in the expansive Indian financial context, this paper introduces CA-Ben, a Chartered Accountancy benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the financial, legal, and quantitative reasoning capabilities of LLMs. CA-Ben comprises structured question-answer datasets derived from the rigorous examinations conducted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), spanning foundational, intermediate, and advanced CA curriculum stages. Six prominent LLMs i.e. GPT 4o, LLAMA 3.3 70B, LLAMA 3.1 405B, MISTRAL Large, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Microsoft Phi 4 were evaluated using standardized protocols. Results indicate variations in performance, with Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o outperforming others, especially in conceptual and legal reasoning. Notable challenges emerged in numerical computations and legal interpretations. The findings emphasize the strengths and limitations of current LLMs, suggesting future improvements through hybrid reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation methods, particularly for quantitative analysis and accurate legal interpretation.

Abstract: Long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks pose fundamental challenges for reinforcement learning (RL), particularly when goals are distant and rewards are sparse. While hierarchical and graph-based methods offer partial solutions, they often suffer from subgoal infeasibility and inefficient planning. We introduce Strict Subgoal Execution (SSE), a graph-based hierarchical RL framework that enforces single-step subgoal reachability by structurally constraining high-level decision-making. To enhance exploration, SSE employs a decoupled exploration policy that systematically traverses underexplored regions of the goal space. Furthermore, a failure-aware path refinement, which refines graph-based planning by dynamically adjusting edge costs according to observed low-level success rates, thereby improving subgoal reliability. Experimental results across diverse long-horizon benchmarks demonstrate that SSE consistently outperforms existing goal-conditioned RL and hierarchical RL approaches in both efficiency and success rate.

Abstract: Ensuring robust planning and decision-making under rare, diverse, and visually degraded long-tail scenarios remains a fundamental challenge for autonomous driving in urban environments. This issue becomes more critical in cooperative settings, where vehicles and infrastructure jointly perceive and reason across complex environments. To address this challenge, we propose V2X-REALM, a vision-language model (VLM)-based framework with adaptive multimodal learning for robust cooperative autonomous driving under long-tail scenarios. V2X-REALM introduces three core innovations: (i) a prompt-driven long-tail scenario generation and evaluation pipeline that leverages foundation models to synthesize realistic long-tail conditions such as snow and fog across vehicle- and infrastructure-side views, enriching training diversity efficiently; (ii) a gated multi-scenario adaptive attention module that modulates the visual stream using scenario priors to recalibrate ambiguous or corrupted features; and (iii) a multi-task scenario-aware contrastive learning objective that improves multimodal alignment and promotes cross-scenario feature separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V2X-REALM significantly outperforms existing baselines in robustness, semantic reasoning, safety, and planning accuracy under complex, challenging driving conditions, advancing the scalability of end-to-end cooperative autonomous driving.

<title>Efficient Skill Discovery via Regret-Aware Optimization</title>

Abstract: Unsupervised skill discovery aims to learn diverse and distinguishable behaviors in open-ended reinforcement learning. For existing methods, they focus on improving diversity through pure exploration, mutual information optimization, and learning temporal representation. Despite that they perform well on exploration, they remain limited in terms of efficiency, especially for the high-dimensional situations. In this work, we frame skill discovery as a min-max game of skill generation and policy learning, proposing a regret-aware method on top of temporal representation learning that expands the discovered skill space along the direction of upgradable policy strength. The key insight behind the proposed method is that the skill discovery is adversarial to the policy learning, i.e., skills with weak strength should be further explored while less exploration for the skills with converged strength. As an implementation, we score the degree of strength convergence with regret, and guide the skill discovery with a learnable skill generator. To avoid degeneration, skill generation comes from an up-gradable population of skill generators. We conduct experiments on environments with varying complexities and dimension sizes. Empirical results show that our method outperforms baselines in both efficiency and diversity. Moreover, our method achieves a 15% zero shot improvement in high-dimensional environments, compared to existing methods.

<title>Improving Diffusion-Based Image Editing Faithfulness via Guidance and Scheduling</title>

Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have become essential for high-quality image synthesis, enabling dynamic image editing. In image editing, two crucial aspects are editability, which determines the extent of modification, and faithfulness, which reflects how well unaltered elements are preserved. However, achieving optimal results is challenging because of the inherent trade-off between editability and faithfulness. To address this, we propose Faithfulness Guidance and Scheduling (FGS), which enhances faithfulness with minimal impact on editability. FGS incorporates faithfulness guidance to strengthen the preservation of input image information and introduces a scheduling strategy to resolve misalignment between editability and faithfulness. Experimental results demonstrate that FGS achieves superior faithfulness while maintaining editability. Moreover, its compatibility with various editing methods enables precise, high-quality image edits across diverse tasks.

<title>A Semi-supervised Scalable Unified Framework for E-commerce Query Classification</title>

Abstract: Query classification, including multiple subtasks such as intent and category prediction, is vital to e-commerce applications. E-commerce queries are usually short and lack context, and the information between labels cannot be used, resulting in insufficient prior information for modeling. Most existing industrial query classification methods rely on users' posterior click behavior to construct training samples, resulting in a Matthew vicious cycle. Furthermore, the subtasks of query classification lack a unified framework, leading to low efficiency for algorithm optimization.
  In this paper, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Scalable Unified Framework (SSUF), containing multiple enhanced modules to unify the query classification tasks. The knowledge-enhanced module uses world knowledge to enhance query representations and solve the problem of insufficient query information. The label-enhanced module uses label semantics and semi-supervised signals to reduce the dependence on posterior labels. The structure-enhanced module enhances the label representation based on the complex label relations. Each module is highly pluggable, and input features can be added or removed as needed according to each subtask. We conduct extensive offline and online A/B experiments, and the results show that SSUF significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Modern perception models, particularly those designed for multisensory egocentric tasks, have achieved remarkable performance but often come with substantial computational costs. These high demands pose challenges for real-world deployment, especially in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we introduce EgoAdapt, a framework that adaptively performs cross-modal distillation and policy learning to enable efficient inference across different egocentric perception tasks, including egocentric action recognition, active speaker localization, and behavior anticipation. Our proposed policy module is adaptable to task-specific action spaces, making it broadly applicable. Experimental results on three challenging egocentric datasets EPIC-Kitchens, EasyCom, and Aria Everyday Activities demonstrate that our method significantly enhances efficiency, reducing GMACs by up to 89.09%, parameters up to 82.02%, and energy up to 9.6x, while still on-par and in many cases outperforming, the performance of corresponding state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Molecular docking plays a crucial role in predicting the binding mode of ligands to target proteins, and covalent interactions, which involve the formation of a covalent bond between the ligand and the target, are particularly valuable due to their strong, enduring binding nature. However, most existing docking methods and deep learning approaches hardly account for the formation of covalent bonds and the associated structural changes. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for covalent docking, CovDocker, which is designed to better capture the complexities of covalent binding. We decompose the covalent docking process into three main tasks: reactive location prediction, covalent reaction prediction, and covalent docking. By adapting state-of-the-art models, such as Uni-Mol and Chemformer, we establish baseline performances and demonstrate the effectiveness of the benchmark in accurately predicting interaction sites and modeling the molecular transformations involved in covalent binding. These results confirm the role of the benchmark as a rigorous framework for advancing research in covalent drug design. It underscores the potential of data-driven approaches to accelerate the discovery of selective covalent inhibitors and addresses critical challenges in therapeutic development.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple clients without sharing clients' private data. However, fairness remains a key concern, as biases in local clients' datasets can impact the entire federated system. Heterogeneous data distributions across clients may lead to models that are fairer for some clients than others. Although several fairness-enhancing solutions are present in the literature, most focus on mitigating bias for a single sensitive attribute, typically binary, overlooking the diverse and sometimes conflicting fairness needs of different clients. This limited perspective can limit the effectiveness of fairness interventions for the different clients. To support more robust and reproducible fairness research in FL, we aim to enable a consistent benchmarking of fairness-aware FL methods at both the global and client levels. In this paper, we contribute in three ways: (1) We introduce FeDa4Fair, a library to generate tabular datasets tailored to evaluating fair FL methods under heterogeneous client bias; (2) we release four bias-heterogeneous datasets and corresponding benchmarks to compare fairness mitigation methods in a controlled environment; (3) we provide ready-to-use functions for evaluating fairness outcomes for these datasets.

Abstract: Community Question Answering (CQA) platforms can be deemed as important knowledge bases in community, but effectively leveraging historical interactions and domain knowledge in real-time remains a challenge. Existing methods often underutilize external knowledge, fail to incorporate dynamic historical QA context, or lack memory mechanisms suited for industrial deployment. We propose ComRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework for real-time industrial CQA that integrates static knowledge with dynamic historical QA pairs via a centroid-based memory mechanism designed for retrieval, generation, and efficient storage. Evaluated on three industrial CQA datasets, ComRAG consistently outperforms all baselines--achieving up to 25.9% improvement in vector similarity, reducing latency by 8.7% to 23.3%, and lowering chunk growth from 20.23% to 2.06% over iterations.

<title>Interpretable Hierarchical Concept Reasoning through Attention-Guided Graph Learning</title>

Abstract: Concept-Based Models (CBMs) are a class of deep learning models that provide interpretability by explaining predictions through high-level concepts. These models first predict concepts and then use them to perform a downstream task. However, current CBMs offer interpretability only for the final task prediction, while the concept predictions themselves are typically made via black-box neural networks. To address this limitation, we propose Hierarchical Concept Memory Reasoner (H-CMR), a new CBM that provides interpretability for both concept and task predictions. H-CMR models relationships between concepts using a learned directed acyclic graph, where edges represent logic rules that define concepts in terms of other concepts. During inference, H-CMR employs a neural attention mechanism to select a subset of these rules, which are then applied hierarchically to predict all concepts and the final task. Experimental results demonstrate that H-CMR matches state-of-the-art performance while enabling strong human interaction through concept and model interventions. The former can significantly improve accuracy at inference time, while the latter can enhance data efficiency during training when background knowledge is available.

Abstract: Phishing attacks pose a significant cybersecurity threat, evolving rapidly to bypass detection mechanisms and exploit human vulnerabilities. This paper introduces PhishKey to address the challenges of adaptability, robustness, and efficiency. PhishKey is a novel phishing detection method using automatic feature extraction from hybrid sources. PhishKey combines character-level processing with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for URL classification, and a Centroid-Based Key Component Phishing Extractor (CAPE) for HTML content at the word level. CAPE reduces noise and ensures complete sample processing avoiding crop operations on the input data. The predictions from both modules are integrated using a soft-voting ensemble to achieve more accurate and reliable classifications. Experimental evaluations on four state-of-the-art datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PhishKey. It achieves up to 98.70% F1 Score and shows strong resistance to adversarial manipulations such as injection attacks with minimal performance degradation.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable understanding capabilities, but are found struggling to tackle multi-shot scenarios,e.g., video clips with varying camera angles or scene changes. This challenge can render failures such as instance identity forgetting and key frame negligence. In this work, we first attribute the challenge to the lack of multi-shot annotations among existing datasets and therefore we introduce a new dataset termed MultiClip-Bench, featuring dense descriptions and instruction-based question-answering pairs tailored for multi-shot scenarios. We empirically find that the training set significantly boosts the multi-shot performance, while the testing benchmark provides a reliable measure of the model capability in multi-shot scenarios. By further analyzing and discovering that current models only encode instance features in a discrete or lossy manner, at the risk of missing identity information, we then contribute a new model IPFormer-VideoLLM. Its key idea is the injection of instance-level features as instance prompts through an efficient attention-based connector. This allows for the aggregation of instance-specific information across scenes. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed dataset and model not only enhance the multi-scene video understanding significantly, but also offer distinct advantages across various video benchmarks.

Abstract: Fine-tuning is a promising technique for leveraging Transformer-based language models in downstream tasks. As model sizes continue to grow, updating all model parameters becomes increasingly costly. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods effectively address this issue by selectively updating a small subset of parameters. However, fine-tuning and most existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods require updating the same number of parameters as the initial size, ignoring the unequal contribution across Transformer blocks and leading to extremely inefficient allocation of computing resources. In this paper, we propose Progtuning, the novel fine-tuning framework combined with progressive learning for Transformer-based language models. Specifically, Progtuning progressively reduces the number of updated transformer blocks based on the contribution. Remarkably, Progtuning optimizes resource allocation and reduces the number of updated parameters by approximately 25\%, while still maintaining competitive performance. And it also exhibits high adaptability with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, demonstrating excellent performance across various adaptation scenarios.

<title>Robust Policy Switching for Antifragile Reinforcement Learning for UAV Deconfliction in Adversarial Environments</title>

Abstract: The increasing automation of navigation for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has exposed them to adversarial attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in reinforcement learning (RL) through sensor manipulation. Although existing robust RL methods aim to mitigate such threats, their effectiveness has limited generalization to out-of-distribution shifts from the optimal value distribution, as they are primarily designed to handle fixed perturbation. To address this limitation, this paper introduces an antifragile RL framework that enhances adaptability to broader distributional shifts by incorporating a switching mechanism based on discounted Thompson sampling (DTS). This mechanism dynamically selects among multiple robust policies to minimize adversarially induced state-action-value distribution shifts. The proposed approach first derives a diverse ensemble of action robust policies by accounting for a range of perturbations in the policy space. These policies are then modeled as a multiarmed bandit (MAB) problem, where DTS optimally selects policies in response to nonstationary Bernoulli rewards, effectively adapting to evolving adversarial strategies. Theoretical framework has also been provided where by optimizing the DTS to minimize the overall regrets due to distributional shift, results in effective adaptation against unseen adversarial attacks thus inducing antifragility. Extensive numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in complex navigation environments with multiple dynamic three-dimensional obstacles and with stronger projected gradient descent (PGD) and spoofing attacks. Compared to conventional robust, non-adaptive RL methods, the antifragile approach achieves superior performance, demonstrating shorter navigation path lengths and a higher rate of conflict-free navigation trajectories compared to existing robust RL techniques

<title>Curriculum-Guided Antifragile Reinforcement Learning for Secure UAV Deconfliction under Observation-Space Attacks</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies deployed in safety-critical systems, such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation in dynamic airspace, are vulnerable to out-ofdistribution (OOD) adversarial attacks in the observation space. These attacks induce distributional shifts that significantly degrade value estimation, leading to unsafe or suboptimal decision making rendering the existing policy fragile. To address this vulnerability, we propose an antifragile RL framework designed to adapt against curriculum of incremental adversarial perturbations. The framework introduces a simulated attacker which incrementally increases the strength of observation-space perturbations which enables the RL agent to adapt and generalize across a wider range of OOD observations and anticipate previously unseen attacks. We begin with a theoretical characterization of fragility, formally defining catastrophic forgetting as a monotonic divergence in value function distributions with increasing perturbation strength. Building on this, we define antifragility as the boundedness of such value shifts and derive adaptation conditions under which forgetting is stabilized. Our method enforces these bounds through iterative expert-guided critic alignment using Wasserstein distance minimization across incrementally perturbed observations. We empirically evaluate the approach in a UAV deconfliction scenario involving dynamic 3D obstacles. Results show that the antifragile policy consistently outperforms standard and robust RL baselines when subjected to both projected gradient descent (PGD) and GPS spoofing attacks, achieving up to 15% higher cumulative reward and over 30% fewer conflict events. These findings demonstrate the practical and theoretical viability of antifragile reinforcement learning for secure and resilient decision-making in environments with evolving threat scenarios.

Abstract: The shortage of publicly available, labeled requirements datasets remains a major barrier to advancing Artificial Intelligence for Requirements Engineering (AI4RE). While Large Language Models offer promising capabilities for synthetic data generation, systematic approaches to control and optimize the quality of generated requirements remain underexplored. This paper presents Synthline v1, an enhanced Product Line approach for generating synthetic requirements data that extends our earlier v0 version with advanced generation strategies and curation techniques. We investigate four research questions assessing how prompting strategies, automated prompt optimization, and post-generation curation affect data quality across four classification tasks: defect detection, functional vs. non-functional, quality vs. non-quality, and security vs. non-security. Our evaluation shows that multi-sample prompting significantly boosts both utility and diversity over single-sample generation, with F1-score gains from 6 to 44 points. The use of PACE (Prompt Actor-Critic Editing) for automated prompt optimization yields task-dependent results, greatly improving functional classification (+32.5 points) but reducing performance on others. Interestingly, similarity-based curation improves diversity but often harms classification performance, indicating that some redundancy may help ML models. Most importantly, our results show that synthetic requirements can match or outperform human-authored ones for specific tasks, with synthetic data surpassing human data for security (+7.8 points) and defect classification (+15.4 points). These findings offer practical insights for AI4RE and chart a viable path to mitigating dataset scarcity through systematic synthetic generation.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) transform spontaneous/evoked neural activity into control commands for external communication. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) remain the mainstream backbone for EEG decoding, their inherently short receptive field makes it difficult to capture long-range temporal dependencies and global inter-channel relationships. Recent CNN-Transformer (Conformers) hybrids partially address this issue, but most adopt a serial design, resulting in suboptimal integration of local and global features, and often overlook explicit channel-wise modeling. To address these limitations, we propose DBConformer, a dual-branch convolutional Transformer network tailored for EEG decoding. It integrates a temporal Conformer to model long-range temporal dependencies and a spatial Conformer to extract inter-channel interactions, capturing both temporal dynamics and spatial patterns in EEG signals. A lightweight channel attention module further refines spatial representations by assigning data-driven importance to EEG channels. Extensive experiments on five motor imagery (MI) datasets and two seizure detection datasets under three evaluation settings demonstrate that DBConformer consistently outperforms 10 competitive baseline models, with over eight times fewer parameters than the high-capacity EEG Conformer baseline. Further, the visualization results confirm that the features extracted by DBConformer are physiologically interpretable and aligned with sensorimotor priors in MI. The superior performance and interpretability of DBConformer make it reliable for robust and explainable EEG decoding. Code is publicized at https://github.com/wzwvv/DBConformer.

Abstract: In neural network compression, most current methods reduce unnecessary parameters by measuring importance and redundancy. To augment already highly optimized existing solutions, we propose linearity-based compression as a novel way to reduce weights in a neural network. It is based on the intuition that with ReLU-like activation functions, neurons that are almost always activated behave linearly, allowing for merging of subsequent layers. We introduce the theory underlying this compression and evaluate our approach experimentally. Our novel method achieves a lossless compression down to 1/4 of the original model size in over the majority of tested models. Applying our method on already importance-based pruned models shows very little interference between different types of compression, demonstrating the option of successful combination of techniques. Overall, our work lays the foundation for a new type of compression method that enables smaller and ultimately more efficient neural network models.

Abstract: The accurate segmentation of myocardial scars from cardiac MRI is essential for clinical assessment and treatment planning. In this study, we propose a robust deep-learning pipeline for fully automated myocardial scar detection and segmentation by fine-tuning state-of-the-art models. The method explicitly addresses challenges of label noise from semi-automatic annotations, data heterogeneity, and class imbalance through the use of Kullback-Leibler loss and extensive data augmentation. We evaluate the model's performance on both acute and chronic cases and demonstrate its ability to produce accurate and smooth segmentations despite noisy labels. In particular, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models like nnU-Net and shows strong generalizability in an out-of-distribution test set, highlighting its robustness across various imaging conditions and clinical tasks. These results establish a reliable foundation for automated myocardial scar quantification and support the broader clinical adoption of deep learning in cardiac imaging.

Abstract: The real world naturally has dimensions of time and space. Therefore, estimating the counterfactual outcomes with spatial-temporal attributes is a crucial problem. However, previous methods are based on classical statistical models, which still have limitations in performance and generalization. This paper proposes a novel framework for estimating counterfactual outcomes with spatial-temporal attributes using the Transformer, exhibiting stronger estimation ability. Under mild assumptions, the proposed estimator within this framework is consistent and asymptotically normal. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct simulation experiments and real data experiments. Simulation experiments show that our estimator has a stronger estimation capability than baseline methods. Real data experiments provide a valuable conclusion to the causal effect of conflicts on forest loss in Colombia.

Abstract: 3D ultrasound (US) imaging has shown significant benefits in enhancing the outcomes of percutaneous liver tumour ablation. Its clinical integration is crucial for transitioning 3D US into the therapeutic domain. However, challenges of tumour identification in US images continue to hinder its broader adoption. In this work, we propose a novel framework for integrating 3D US into the standard ablation workflow. We present a key component, a clinically viable 2D US-CT/MRI registration approach, leveraging 3D US as an intermediary to reduce registration complexity. To facilitate efficient verification of the registration workflow, we also propose an intuitive multimodal image visualization technique. In our study, 2D US-CT/MRI registration achieved a landmark distance error of approximately 2-4 mm with a runtime of 0.22s per image pair. Additionally, non-rigid registration reduced the mean alignment error by approximately 40% compared to rigid registration. Results demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed 2D US-CT/MRI registration workflow. Our integration framework advanced the capabilities of 3D US imaging in improving percutaneous tumour ablation, demonstrating the potential to expand the therapeutic role of 3D US in clinical interventions.

Abstract: Identifying instrument activities within audio excerpts is vital in music information retrieval, with significant implications for music cataloging and discovery. Prior deep learning endeavors in musical instrument recognition have predominantly emphasized instrument classes with ample data availability. Recent studies have demonstrated the applicability of hierarchical classification in detecting instrument activities in orchestral music, even with limited fine-grained annotations at the instrument level. Based on the Hornbostel-Sachs classification, such a hierarchical classification system is evaluated using the MedleyDB dataset, renowned for its diversity and richness concerning various instruments and music genres. This work presents various strategies to integrate hierarchical structures into models and tests a new class of models for hierarchical music prediction. This study showcases more reliable coarse-level instrument detection by bridging the gap between detailed instrument identification and group-level recognition, paving the way for further advancements in this domain.

<title>Task-Aware KV Compression For Cost-Effective Long Video Understanding</title>

Abstract: Long-video understanding (LVU) remains a severe challenge for existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs), primarily due to the prohibitive computational cost. Recent approaches have explored KV compression to mitigate this issue, but they often suffer from significant information loss at high compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce Video-X^2L, which flexibly preserves critical video information for each LVU task. Video-X^2L involves two key operations. The first one is called bi-level KV compression. During the MLLM's pre-filling stage, Video-X^2L generates two types of compressed KVs: low-compression KVs (L-KVs) to capture fine-grained video details and high-compression KVs (H-KVs) to offer compact video representations. The second one is called selective KV re-loading. During the MLLM's decoding stage, Video-X^2L selectively re-loads L-KVs for the most critical video chunks while using H-KVs for other less important ones. This allows the MLLM to fully utilize task-specific information while maintaining the overall compactness. Video-X^2L is simple yet effective: it is free from additional training and directly compatible with existing KV-compressible MLLMs. We evaluate Video-X^2L with a variety of popular LVU benchmarks, including VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench, and VNBench. Our experiment result shows that Video-X^2L outperforms existing KV-compression methods by a huge advantage while substantially saving the computation cost.

<title>BitMark for Infinity: Watermarking Bitwise Autoregressive Image Generative Models</title>

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models like Infinity generate photorealistic images at an unprecedented speed. These models operate in a bitwise autoregressive manner over a discrete set of tokens that is practically infinite in size. However, their impressive generative power comes with a growing risk: as their outputs increasingly populate the Internet, they are likely to be scraped and reused as training data-potentially by the very same models. This phenomenon has been shown to lead to model collapse, where repeated training on generated content, especially from the models' own previous versions, causes a gradual degradation in performance. A promising mitigation strategy is watermarking, which embeds human-imperceptible yet detectable signals into generated images-enabling the identification of generated content. In this work, we introduce BitMark, a robust bitwise watermarking framework for Infinity. Our method embeds a watermark directly at the bit level of the token stream across multiple scales (also referred to as resolutions) during Infinity's image generation process. Our bitwise watermark subtly influences the bits to preserve visual fidelity and generation speed while remaining robust against a spectrum of removal techniques. Furthermore, it exhibits high radioactivity, i.e., when watermarked generated images are used to train another image generative model, this second model's outputs will also carry the watermark. The radioactive traces remain detectable even when only fine-tuning diffusion or image autoregressive models on images watermarked with our BitMark. Overall, our approach provides a principled step toward preventing model collapse in image generative models by enabling reliable detection of generated outputs.

Abstract: Automatic Program Repair (APR) is a core technology in software development and maintenance, with aims to enable automated defect repair with minimal human intervention. In recent years, the substantial advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of these models. However, due to the complex logic and multi-step reasoning ability needed, the application of CoT techniques in the APR domain remains insufficient. This study systematically evaluates the performance of several common CoT techniques in APR tasks and proposes an innovative framework $T^3$, which integrates the powerful reasoning capabilities of LLMs with tree search, effectively improving the precision of generating candidate repair solutions. Furthermore, $T^3$ provides valuable guidance for optimizing sample selection and repair strategies in APR tasks, establishing a robust framework for achieving efficient automated debugging.

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of data source diversity on the performance of cryptocurrency forecasting models by integrating various data categories, including technical indicators, on-chain metrics, sentiment and interest metrics, traditional market indices, and macroeconomic indicators. We introduce the Crypto100 index, representing the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, and propose a novel feature reduction algorithm to identify the most impactful and resilient features from diverse data sources. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that data source diversity significantly enhances the predictive performance of forecasting models across different time horizons. Key findings include the paramount importance of on-chain metrics for both short-term and long-term predictions, the growing relevance of traditional market indices and macroeconomic indicators for longer-term forecasts, and substantial improvements in model accuracy when diverse data sources are utilized. These insights help demystify the short-term and long-term driving factors of the cryptocurrency market and lay the groundwork for developing more accurate and resilient forecasting models.

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) advance, multimodal agents show promise in real-world tasks like web navigation and embodied intelligence. However, due to limitations in a lack of external feedback, these agents struggle with self-correction and generalization. A promising approach is to use reward models as external feedback, but there is no clear on how to select reward models for agents. Thus, there is an urgent need to build a reward bench targeted at agents. To address these challenges, we propose Agent-RewardBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate reward modeling ability in MLLMs. The benchmark is characterized by three key features: (1) Multiple dimensions and real-world agent scenarios evaluation. It covers perception, planning, and safety with 7 scenarios; (2) Step-level reward evaluation. It allows for the assessment of agent capabilities at the individual steps of a task, providing a more granular view of performance during the planning process; and (3) Appropriately difficulty and high-quality. We carefully sample from 10 diverse models, difficulty control to maintain task challenges, and manual verification to ensure the integrity of the data. Experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art multimodal models show limited performance, highlighting the need for specialized training in agent reward modeling. Code is available at github.

Abstract: The distributed training of foundation models, particularly large language models (LLMs), demands a high level of communication. Consequently, it is highly dependent on a centralized cluster with fast and reliable interconnects. Can we conduct training on slow networks and thereby unleash the power of decentralized clusters when dealing with models exceeding 100 billion parameters? In this paper, we propose DiLoCoX, a low-communication large-scale decentralized cluster training framework. It combines Pipeline Parallelism with Dual Optimizer Policy, One-Step-Delay Overlap of Communication and Local Training, and an Adaptive Gradient Compression Scheme. This combination significantly improves the scale of parameters and the speed of model pre-training. We justify the benefits of one-step-delay overlap of communication and local training, as well as the adaptive gradient compression scheme, through a theoretical analysis of convergence. Empirically, we demonstrate that DiLoCoX is capable of pre-training a 107B foundation model over a 1Gbps network. Compared to vanilla AllReduce, DiLoCoX can achieve a 357x speedup in distributed training while maintaining negligible degradation in model convergence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first decentralized training framework successfully applied to models with over 100 billion parameters.

Abstract: This study presents and publicly releases the Suzhou Urban Road Acoustic Dataset (SZUR-Acoustic Dataset), which is accompanied by comprehensive data-acquisition protocols and annotation guidelines to ensure transparency and reproducibility of the experimental workflow. To model the coupling between vehicular noise and driving speed, we propose a bimodal-feature-fusion deep convolutional neural network (BMCNN). During preprocessing, an adaptive denoising and normalization strategy is applied to suppress environmental background interference; in the network architecture, parallel branches extract Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and wavelet-packet energy features, which are subsequently fused via a cross-modal attention mechanism in the intermediate feature space to fully exploit time-frequency information. Experimental results demonstrate that BMCNN achieves a classification accuracy of 87.56% on the SZUR-Acoustic Dataset and 96.28% on the public IDMT-Traffic dataset. Ablation studies and robustness tests on the Suzhou dataset further validate the contributions of each module to performance improvement and overfitting mitigation. The proposed acoustics-based speed classification method can be integrated into smart-city traffic management systems for real-time noise monitoring and speed estimation, thereby optimizing traffic flow control, reducing roadside noise pollution, and supporting sustainable urban planning.

<title>Hyperspherical Variational Autoencoders Using Efficient Spherical Cauchy Distribution</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.21278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture that employs a spherical Cauchy (spCauchy) latent distribution. Unlike traditional Gaussian latent spaces or the widely used von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution, spCauchy provides a more natural hyperspherical representation of latent variables, better capturing directional data while maintaining flexibility. Its heavy-tailed nature prevents over-regularization, ensuring efficient latent space utilization while offering a more expressive representation. Additionally, spCauchy circumvents the numerical instabilities inherent to vMF, which arise from computing normalization constants involving Bessel functions. Instead, it enables a fully differentiable and efficient reparameterization trick via M\"obius transformations, allowing for stable and scalable training. The KL divergence can be computed through a rapidly converging power series, eliminating concerns of underflow or overflow associated with evaluation of ratios of hypergeometric functions. These properties make spCauchy a compelling alternative for VAEs, offering both theoretical advantages and practical efficiency in high-dimensional generative modeling.

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external context significantly improves their performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, LLMs struggle to answer queries reliably when the provided context lacks information, often resorting to ungrounded speculation or internal knowledge. Groundedness - generating responses strictly supported by the context - is essential for ensuring factual consistency and trustworthiness. This study focuses on detecting whether a given query is grounded in a document provided in context before the costly answer generation by LLMs. Such a detection mechanism can significantly reduce both inference time and resource consumption. We show that lightweight, task specific encoder models such as RoBERTa and NomicBERT, fine-tuned on curated datasets, can achieve accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Llama3 8B and GPT4o, in groundedness detection while reducing inference latency by orders of magnitude.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the use of a text-only, autoregressive language modeling approach for the extraction of referring expressions from visually grounded dialogue. More specifically, the aim is to investigate the extent to which the linguistic context alone can inform the detection of mentions that have a (visually perceivable) referent in the visual context of the conversation. To this end, we adapt a pretrained large language model (LLM) to perform a relatively course-grained annotation of mention spans in unfolding conversations by demarcating mention span boundaries in text via next-token prediction. Our findings indicate that even when using a moderately sized LLM, relatively small datasets, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, a text-only approach can be effective, highlighting the relative importance of the linguistic context for this task. Nevertheless, we argue that the task represents an inherently multimodal problem and discuss limitations fundamental to unimodal approaches.

<title>Exploring Adapter Design Tradeoffs for Low Resource Music Generation</title>

Abstract: Fine-tuning large-scale music generation models, such as MusicGen and Mustango, is a computationally expensive process, often requiring updates to billions of parameters and, therefore, significant hardware resources. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques, particularly adapter-based methods, have emerged as a promising alternative, enabling adaptation with minimal trainable parameters while preserving model performance. However, the design choices for adapters, including their architecture, placement, and size, are numerous, and it is unclear which of these combinations would produce optimal adapters and why, for a given case of low-resource music genre. In this paper, we attempt to answer this question by studying various adapter configurations for two AI music models, MusicGen and Mustango, on two genres: Hindustani Classical and Turkish Makam music.
  Our findings reveal distinct trade-offs: convolution-based adapters excel in capturing fine-grained local musical details such as ornamentations and short melodic phrases, while transformer-based adapters better preserve long-range dependencies crucial for structured improvisation. Additionally, we analyze computational resource requirements across different adapter scales, demonstrating how mid-sized adapters (40M parameters) achieve an optimal balance between expressivity and quality. Furthermore, we find that Mustango, a diffusion-based model, generates more diverse outputs with better adherence to the description in the input prompt while lacking in providing stability in notes, rhythm alignment, and aesthetics. Also, it is computationally intensive and requires significantly more time to train. In contrast, autoregressive models like MusicGen offer faster training and are more efficient, and can produce better quality output in comparison, but have slightly higher redundancy in their generations.

Abstract: It is a classical result in rational approximation theory that certain non-smooth or singular functions, such as $|x|$ and $x^{1/p}$, can be efficiently approximated using rational functions with root-exponential convergence in terms of degrees of freedom \cite{Sta, GN}. In contrast, polynomial approximations admit only algebraic convergence by Jackson's theorem \cite{Lub2}. Recent work shows that composite polynomial architectures can recover exponential approximation rates even without smoothness \cite{KY}. In this work, we introduce and analyze a class of weighted deep polynomial approximants tailored for functions with asymmetric behavior-growing unbounded on one side and decaying on the other. By multiplying a learnable deep polynomial with a one-sided weight, we capture both local non-smoothness and global growth. We show numerically that this framework outperforms Taylor, Chebyshev, and standard deep polynomial approximants, even when all use the same number of parameters. To optimize these approximants in practice, we propose a stable graph-based parameterization strategy building on \cite{Jar}.

Abstract: Surgical workflow analysis is essential in robot-assisted surgeries, yet the long duration of such procedures poses significant challenges for comprehensive video analysis. Recent approaches have predominantly relied on transformer models; however, their quadratic attention mechanism restricts efficient processing of lengthy surgical videos. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical input-dependent state space model that leverages the linear scaling property of state space models to enable decision making on full-length videos while capturing both local and global dynamics. Our framework incorporates a temporally consistent visual feature extractor, which appends a state space model head to a visual feature extractor to propagate temporal information. The proposed model consists of two key modules: a local-aggregation state space model block that effectively captures intricate local dynamics, and a global-relation state space model block that models temporal dependencies across the entire video. The model is trained using a hybrid discrete-continuous supervision strategy, where both signals of discrete phase labels and continuous phase progresses are propagated through the network. Experiments have shown that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+2.8% on Cholec80, +4.3% on MICCAI2016, and +12.9% on Heichole datasets). Code will be publicly available after paper acceptance.

Abstract: The co creativity community is making significant progress in developing more sophisticated and tailored systems to support and enhance human creativity. Design considerations from prior work can serve as a valuable and efficient foundation for future systems. To support this effort, we conducted a systematic literature review of 62 papers on co-creative systems. These papers cover a diverse range of applications, including visual arts, design, and writing, where the AI acts not just as a tool but as an active collaborator in the creative process. From this review, we identified several key dimensions relevant to system design: phase of the creative process, creative task, proactive behavior of the system, user control, system embodiment, and AI model type. Our findings suggest that systems offering high user control lead to greater satisfaction, trust, and a stronger sense of ownership over creative outcomes. Furthermore, proactive systems, when adaptive and context sensitive, can enhance collaboration. We also extracted 24 design considerations, highlighting the value of encouraging users to externalize their thoughts and of increasing the system's social presence and transparency to foster trust. Despite recent advancements, important gaps remain, such as limited support for early creative phases like problem clarification, and challenges related to user adaptation to AI systems.

Abstract: Detection-free methods typically follow a coarse-to-fine pipeline, extracting image and point cloud features for patch-level matching and refining dense pixel-to-point correspondences. However, differences in feature channel attention between images and point clouds may lead to degraded matching results, ultimately impairing registration accuracy. Furthermore, similar structures in the scene could lead to redundant correspondences in cross-modal matching. To address these issues, we propose Channel Adaptive Adjustment Module (CAA) and Global Optimal Selection Module (GOS). CAA enhances intra-modal features and suppresses cross-modal sensitivity, while GOS replaces local selection with global optimization. Experiments on RGB-D Scenes V2 and 7-Scenes demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving state-of-the-art performance in image-to-point cloud registration.

Abstract: Finetuning large pretrained neural networks is known to be resource-intensive, both in terms of memory and computational cost. To mitigate this, a common approach is to restrict training to a subset of the model parameters. By analyzing the relationship between gradients and weights during finetuning, we observe a notable pattern: large gradients are often associated with small-magnitude weights. This correlation is more pronounced in finetuning settings than in training from scratch. Motivated by this observation, we propose NANOADAM, which dynamically updates only the small-magnitude weights during finetuning and offers several practical advantages: first, this criterion is gradient-free -- the parameter subset can be determined without gradient computation; second, it preserves large-magnitude weights, which are likely to encode critical features learned during pretraining, thereby reducing the risk of catastrophic forgetting; thirdly, it permits the use of larger learning rates and consistently leads to better generalization performance in experiments. We demonstrate this for both NLP and vision tasks.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency transaction fraud detection faces the dual challenges of increasingly complex transaction patterns and severe class imbalance. Traditional methods rely on manual feature engineering and struggle to capture temporal and structural dependencies in transaction networks. This paper proposes an Augmented Temporal-aware Graph Attention Network (ATGAT) that enhances detection performance through three modules: (1) designing an advanced temporal embedding module that fuses multi-scale time difference features with periodic position encoding; (2) constructing a temporal-aware triple attention mechanism that jointly optimizes structural, temporal, and global context attention; (3) employing weighted BCE loss to address class imbalance. Experiments on the Elliptic++ cryptocurrency dataset demonstrate that ATGAT achieves an AUC of 0.9130, representing a 9.2% improvement over the best traditional method XGBoost, 12.0% over GCN, and 10.0% over standard GAT. This method not only validates the enhancement effect of temporal awareness and triple attention mechanisms on graph neural networks, but also provides financial institutions with more reliable fraud detection tools, with its design principles generalizable to other temporal graph anomaly detection tasks.

Abstract: Real-world live retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems face significant challenges when processing user queries that are often noisy, ambiguous, and contain multiple intents. While RAG enhances large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge, current systems typically struggle with such complex inputs, as they are often trained or evaluated on cleaner data. This paper introduces Omni-RAG, a novel framework designed to improve the robustness and effectiveness of RAG systems in live, open-domain settings. Omni-RAG employs LLM-assisted query understanding to preprocess user inputs through three key modules: (1) Deep Query Understanding and Decomposition, which utilizes LLMs with tailored prompts to denoise queries (e.g., correcting spelling errors) and decompose multi-intent queries into structured sub-queries; (2) Intent-Aware Knowledge Retrieval, which performs retrieval for each sub-query from a corpus (i.e., FineWeb using OpenSearch) and aggregates the results; and (3) Reranking and Generation, where a reranker (i.e., BGE) refines document selection before a final response is generated by an LLM (i.e., Falcon-10B) using a chain-of-thought prompt. Omni-RAG aims to bridge the gap between current RAG capabilities and the demands of real-world applications, such as those highlighted by the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge, by robustly handling complex and noisy queries.

Abstract: Despite their widespread use, large language models (LLMs) are known to hallucinate incorrect information and be poorly calibrated. This makes the uncertainty quantification of these models of critical importance, especially in high-stakes domains, such as autonomy and healthcare. Prior work has made Bayesian deep learning-based approaches to this problem more tractable by performing inference over the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) parameters of a fine-tuned model. While effective, these approaches struggle to scale to larger LLMs due to requiring further additional parameters compared to LoRA. In this work we present $\textbf{Scala}$ble $\textbf{B}$ayesian $\textbf{L}$ow-Rank Adaptation via Stochastic Variational Subspace Inference (ScalaBL). We perform Bayesian inference in an $r$-dimensional subspace, for LoRA rank $r$. By repurposing the LoRA parameters as projection matrices, we are able to map samples from this subspace into the full weight space of the LLM. This allows us to learn all the parameters of our approach using stochastic variational inference. Despite the low dimensionality of our subspace, we are able to achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches while only requiring ${\sim}1000$ additional parameters. Furthermore, it allows us to scale up to the largest Bayesian LLM to date, with four times as a many base parameters as prior work.

<title>Domain Knowledge-Enhanced LLMs for Fraud and Concept Drift Detection</title>

Abstract: Detecting deceptive conversations on dynamic platforms is increasingly difficult due to evolving language patterns and Concept Drift (CD)\-i.e., semantic or topical shifts that alter the context or intent of interactions over time. These shifts can obscure malicious intent or mimic normal dialogue, making accurate classification challenging. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong performance in natural language tasks, they often struggle with contextual ambiguity and hallucinations in risk\-sensitive scenarios. To address these challenges, we present a Domain Knowledge (DK)\-Enhanced LLM framework that integrates pretrained LLMs with structured, task\-specific insights to perform fraud and concept drift detection. The proposed architecture consists of three main components: (1) a DK\-LLM module to detect fake or deceptive conversations; (2) a drift detection unit (OCDD) to determine whether a semantic shift has occurred; and (3) a second DK\-LLM module to classify the drift as either benign or fraudulent. We first validate the value of domain knowledge using a fake review dataset and then apply our full framework to SEConvo, a multiturn dialogue dataset that includes various types of fraud and spam attacks. Results show that our system detects fake conversations with high accuracy and effectively classifies the nature of drift. Guided by structured prompts, the LLaMA\-based implementation achieves 98\% classification accuracy. Comparative studies against zero\-shot baselines demonstrate that incorporating domain knowledge and drift awareness significantly improves performance, interpretability, and robustness in high\-stakes NLP applications.

<title>Optimising 4th-Order Runge-Kutta Methods: A Dynamic Heuristic Approach for Efficiency and Low Storage</title>

Abstract: Extended Stability Runge-Kutta (ESRK) methods are crucial for solving large-scale computational problems in science and engineering, including weather forecasting, aerodynamic analysis, and complex biological modelling. However, balancing accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency remains challenging, particularly for high-order, low-storage schemes. This study introduces a hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach for automated heuristic discovery, optimising low-storage ESRK methods. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on manually designed heuristics or exhaustive numerical searches, our method leverages GA-driven mutations for search-space exploration and an RL-inspired state transition mechanism to refine heuristic selection dynamically. This enables systematic parameter reduction, preserving fourth-order accuracy while significantly improving computational efficiency.The proposed GA-RL heuristic optimisation framework is validated through rigorous testing on benchmark problems, including the 1D and 2D Brusselator systems and the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations. The best-performing heuristic achieves a 25\% reduction in IPOPT runtime compared to traditional ESRK optimisation processes while maintaining numerical stability and accuracy. These findings demonstrate the potential of adaptive heuristic discovery to improve resource efficiency in high-fidelity simulations and broaden the applicability of low-storage Runge-Kutta methods in real-world computational fluid dynamics, physics simulations, and other demanding fields. This work establishes a new paradigm in heuristic optimisation for numerical methods, opening pathways for further exploration using Deep RL and AutoML-based heuristic search

<title>SmoothSinger: A Conditional Diffusion Model for Singing Voice Synthesis with Multi-Resolution Architecture</title>

Abstract: Singing voice synthesis (SVS) aims to generate expressive and high-quality vocals from musical scores, requiring precise modeling of pitch, duration, and articulation. While diffusion-based models have achieved remarkable success in image and video generation, their application to SVS remains challenging due to the complex acoustic and musical characteristics of singing, often resulting in artifacts that degrade naturalness. In this work, we propose SmoothSinger, a conditional diffusion model designed to synthesize high quality and natural singing voices. Unlike prior methods that depend on vocoders as a final stage and often introduce distortion, SmoothSinger refines low-quality synthesized audio directly in a unified framework, mitigating the degradation associated with two-stage pipelines. The model adopts a reference-guided dual-branch architecture, using low-quality audio from any baseline system as a reference to guide the denoising process, enabling more expressive and context-aware synthesis. Furthermore, it enhances the conventional U-Net with a parallel low-frequency upsampling path, allowing the model to better capture pitch contours and long term spectral dependencies. To improve alignment during training, we replace reference audio with degraded ground truth audio, addressing temporal mismatch between reference and target signals. Experiments on the Opencpop dataset, a large-scale Chinese singing corpus, demonstrate that SmoothSinger achieves state-of-the-art results in both objective and subjective evaluations. Extensive ablation studies confirm its effectiveness in reducing artifacts and improving the naturalness of synthesized voices.

Abstract: We focus on the source-free domain adaptive object detection (SF-DAOD) problem when source data is unavailable during adaptation and the model must adapt to an unlabeled target domain. The majority of approaches for the problem employ a self-supervised approach using a student-teacher (ST) framework where pseudo-labels are generated via a source-pretrained model for further fine-tuning. We observe that the performance of a student model often degrades drastically, due to the collapse of the teacher model, primarily caused by high noise in pseudo-labels, resulting from domain bias, discrepancies, and a significant domain shift across domains. To obtain reliable pseudo-labels, we propose a Target-based Iterative Query-Token Adversarial Network (TITAN), which separates the target images into two subsets: those similar to the source (easy) and those dissimilar (hard). We propose a strategy to estimate variance to partition the target domain. This approach leverages the insight that higher detection variances correspond to higher recall and greater similarity to the source domain. Also, we incorporate query-token-based adversarial modules into a student-teacher baseline framework to reduce the domain gaps between two feature representations. Experiments conducted on four natural imaging datasets and two challenging medical datasets have substantiated the superior performance of TITAN compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methodologies. We report an mAP improvement of +22.7, +22.2, +21.1, and +3.7 percent over the current SOTA on C2F, C2B, S2C, and K2C benchmarks, respectively.

Abstract: Fault diagnosis in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) is essential for ensuring system dependability and operational efficiency by accurately detecting anomalies and identifying their root causes. However, the manual modeling of faulty behaviors often demands extensive domain expertise and produces models that are complex, error-prone, and difficult to interpret. To address this challenge, we present a novel unsupervised fault diagnosis methodology that integrates collective anomaly detection in multivariate time series, process mining, and stochastic simulation. Initially, collective anomalies are detected from low-level sensor data using multivariate time-series analysis. These anomalies are then transformed into structured event logs, enabling the discovery of interpretable process models through process mining. By incorporating timing distributions into the extracted Petri nets, the approach supports stochastic simulation of faulty behaviors, thereby enhancing root cause analysis and behavioral understanding. The methodology is validated using the Robotic Arm Dataset (RoAD), a widely recognized benchmark in smart manufacturing. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in modeling, simulating, and classifying faulty behaviors in CPSs. This enables the creation of comprehensive fault dictionaries that support predictive maintenance and the development of digital twins for industrial environments.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce skLEP, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for evaluating Slovak natural language understanding (NLU) models. We have compiled skLEP to encompass nine diverse tasks that span token-level, sentence-pair, and document-level challenges, thereby offering a thorough assessment of model capabilities. To create this benchmark, we curated new, original datasets tailored for Slovak and meticulously translated established English NLU resources. Within this paper, we also present the first systematic and extensive evaluation of a wide array of Slovak-specific, multilingual, and English pre-trained language models using the skLEP tasks. Finally, we also release the complete benchmark data, an open-source toolkit facilitating both fine-tuning and evaluation of models, and a public leaderboard at https://github.com/slovak-nlp/sklep in the hopes of fostering reproducibility and drive future research in Slovak NLU.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are regularly evaluated using benchmark datasets. But what justifies making inferences about an LLM's capabilities based on its answers to a curated set of questions? This paper first introduces a formal framework to address this question. The key is to note that the benchmarks used to test LLMs -- such as AP exams -- are also those used to test people. However, this raises an implication: these benchmarks are only valid tests if LLMs misunderstand concepts in ways that mirror human misunderstandings. Otherwise, success on benchmarks only demonstrates potemkin understanding: the illusion of understanding driven by answers irreconcilable with how any human would interpret a concept. We present two procedures for quantifying the existence of potemkins: one using a specially designed benchmark in three domains, the other using a general procedure that provides a lower-bound on their prevalence. We find that potemkins are ubiquitous across models, tasks, and domains. We also find that these failures reflect not just incorrect understanding, but deeper internal incoherence in concept representations.

Abstract: People are increasingly seeking healthcare information from large language models (LLMs) via interactive chatbots, yet the nature and inherent risks of these conversations remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we filter large-scale conversational AI datasets to achieve HealthChat-11K, a curated dataset of 11K real-world conversations composed of 25K user messages. We use HealthChat-11K and a clinician-driven taxonomy for how users interact with LLMs when seeking healthcare information in order to systematically study user interactions across 21 distinct health specialties. Our analysis reveals insights into the nature of how and why users seek health information, such as common interactions, instances of incomplete context, affective behaviors, and interactions (e.g., leading questions) that can induce sycophancy, underscoring the need for improvements in the healthcare support capabilities of LLMs deployed as conversational AI.

<title>WorldVLA: Towards Autoregressive Action World Model</title>

Abstract: We present WorldVLA, an autoregressive action world model that unifies action and image understanding and generation. Our WorldVLA intergrates Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model and world model in one single framework. The world model predicts future images by leveraging both action and image understanding, with the purpose of learning the underlying physics of the environment to improve action generation. Meanwhile, the action model generates the subsequent actions based on image observations, aiding in visual understanding and in turn helps visual generation of the world model. We demonstrate that WorldVLA outperforms standalone action and world models, highlighting the mutual enhancement between the world model and the action model. In addition, we find that the performance of the action model deteriorates when generating sequences of actions in an autoregressive manner. This phenomenon can be attributed to the model's limited generalization capability for action prediction, leading to the propagation of errors from earlier actions to subsequent ones. To address this issue, we propose an attention mask strategy that selectively masks prior actions during the generation of the current action, which shows significant performance improvement in the action chunk generation task.

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language segmentation has significantly advanced grounded visual understanding. However, these models often exhibit hallucinations by producing segmentation masks for objects not grounded in the image content or by incorrectly labeling irrelevant regions. Existing evaluation protocols for segmentation hallucination primarily focus on label or textual hallucinations without manipulating the visual context, limiting their capacity to diagnose critical failures. In response, we introduce HalluSegBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate hallucinations in visual grounding through the lens of counterfactual visual reasoning. Our benchmark consists of a novel dataset of 1340 counterfactual instance pairs spanning 281 unique object classes, and a set of newly introduced metrics that quantify hallucination sensitivity under visually coherent scene edits. Experiments on HalluSegBench with state-of-the-art vision-language segmentation models reveal that vision-driven hallucinations are significantly more prevalent than label-driven ones, with models often persisting in false segmentation, highlighting the need for counterfactual reasoning to diagnose grounding fidelity.

Abstract: Multivariate time series anomaly detection (MTS-AD) is critical in domains like healthcare, cybersecurity, and industrial monitoring, yet remains challenging due to complex inter-variable dependencies, temporal dynamics, and sparse anomaly labels. We introduce mTSBench, the largest benchmark to date for MTS-AD and unsupervised model selection, spanning 344 labeled time series across 19 datasets and 12 diverse application domains. mTSBench evaluates 24 anomaly detection methods, including large language model (LLM)-based detectors for multivariate time series, and systematically benchmarks unsupervised model selection techniques under standardized conditions. Consistent with prior findings, our results confirm that no single detector excels across datasets, underscoring the importance of model selection. However, even state-of-the-art selection methods remain far from optimal, revealing critical gaps. mTSBench provides a unified evaluation suite to enable rigorous, reproducible comparisons and catalyze future advances in adaptive anomaly detection and robust model selection.

Abstract: We train models to Predict Ego-centric Video from human Actions (PEVA), given the past video and an action represented by the relative 3D body pose. By conditioning on kinematic pose trajectories, structured by the joint hierarchy of the body, our model learns to simulate how physical human actions shape the environment from a first-person point of view. We train an auto-regressive conditional diffusion transformer on Nymeria, a large-scale dataset of real-world egocentric video and body pose capture. We further design a hierarchical evaluation protocol with increasingly challenging tasks, enabling a comprehensive analysis of the model's embodied prediction and control abilities. Our work represents an initial attempt to tackle the challenges of modeling complex real-world environments and embodied agent behaviors with video prediction from the perspective of a human.

Abstract: When a deep learning model is trained sequentially on different datasets, it often forgets the knowledge learned from previous data, a problem known as catastrophic forgetting. This damages the model's performance on diverse datasets, which is critical in privacy-preserving deep learning (PPDL) applications based on transfer learning (TL). To overcome this, we introduce "review learning" (RevL), a low cost continual learning algorithm for diagnosis prediction using electronic health records (EHR) within a PPDL framework. RevL generates data samples from the model which are used to review knowledge from previous datasets. Six simulated institutional experiments and one real-world experiment involving three medical institutions were conducted to validate RevL, using three binary classification EHR data. In the real-world experiment with data from 106,508 patients, the mean global area under the receiver operating curve was 0.710 for RevL and 0.655 for TL. These results demonstrate RevL's ability to retain previously learned knowledge and its effectiveness in real-world PPDL scenarios. Our work establishes a realistic pipeline for PPDL research based on model transfers across institutions and highlights the practicality of continual learning in real-world medical settings using private EHR data.

Abstract: Recent advancements in autonomous multi-agent systems (MAS) based on large language models (LLMs) have enhanced the application scenarios and improved the capability of LLMs to handle complex tasks. Despite demonstrating effectiveness, existing studies still evidently struggle to evaluate, analysis, and reproducibility of LLM-based MAS. In this paper, to facilitate the research on LLM-based MAS, we introduce an open, scalable, and real-time updated platform for accessing and analyzing the LLM-based MAS based on the games Who is Spy?" (WiS). Our platform is featured with three main worths: (1) a unified model evaluate interface that supports models available on Hugging Face; (2) real-time updated leaderboard for model evaluation; (3) a comprehensive evaluation covering game-winning rates, attacking, defense strategies, and reasoning of LLMs. To rigorously test WiS, we conduct extensive experiments coverage of various open- and closed-source LLMs, we find that different agents exhibit distinct and intriguing behaviors in the game. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our platform in evaluating LLM-based MAS. Our platform and its documentation are publicly available at https://whoisspy.ai/.

Abstract: Being able to cooperate with new people is an important component of many economically valuable AI tasks, from household robotics to autonomous driving. However, generalizing to novel humans requires training on data that captures the diversity of human behaviors. Adversarial training is a promising method that allows dynamic data generation and ensures that agents are robust. It creates a feedback loop where the agent's performance influences the generation of new adversarial data, which can be used immediately to train the agent. However, adversarial training is difficult to apply in a cooperative task; how can we train an adversarial cooperator? We propose a novel strategy that combines a pretrained generative model to simulate valid cooperative agent policies with adversarial training to maximize regret. We call our method GOAT: Generative Online Adversarial Training. In this framework, the GOAT dynamically searches the latent space of the generative model for coordination strategies where the learning policy, the Cooperator agent, underperforms. GOAT enables better generalization by exposing the Cooperator to various challenging interaction scenarios. We maintain realistic coordination strategies by keeping the generative model frozen, thus avoiding adversarial exploitation. We evaluate GOAT with real human partners, and the results demonstrate state of the art performance on the Overcooked benchmark, highlighting its effectiveness in generalizing to diverse human behaviors.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) advances toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and eventually Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), it may potentially surpass human control, deviate from human values, and even lead to irreversible catastrophic consequences in extreme cases. This looming risk underscores the critical importance of the "superalignment" problem - ensuring that AI systems which are much smarter than humans, remain aligned with human (compatible) intentions and values. While current scalable oversight and weak-to-strong generalization methods demonstrate certain applicability, they exhibit fundamental flaws in addressing the superalignment paradigm - notably, the unidirectional imposition of human values cannot accommodate superintelligence's autonomy or ensure AGI/ASI's stable learning. We contend that the values for sustainable symbiotic society should be co-shaped by humans and living AI together, achieving "Super Co-alignment." Guided by this vision, we propose a concrete framework that integrates external oversight and intrinsic proactive alignment. External oversight superalignment should be grounded in human-centered ultimate decision, supplemented by interpretable automated evaluation and correction, to achieve continuous alignment with humanity's evolving values. Intrinsic proactive superalignment is rooted in a profound understanding of the Self, others, and society, integrating self-awareness, self-reflection, and empathy to spontaneously infer human intentions, distinguishing good from evil and proactively prioritizing human well-being. The integration of externally-driven oversight with intrinsically-driven proactive alignment will co-shape symbiotic values and rules through iterative human-AGI/ASI co-alignment, paving the way for achieving safe and beneficial AGI and ASI for good, for human, and for a symbiotic ecology.

Abstract: Extracting structured and quantitative insights from unstructured financial filings is essential in investment research, yet remains time-consuming and resource-intensive. Conventional approaches in practice rely heavily on labor-intensive manual processes, limiting scalability and delaying the research workflow. In this paper, we propose an efficient and scalable method for accurately extracting quantitative insights from unstructured financial documents, leveraging a multi-agent system composed of large language models. Our proposed multi-agent system consists of two specialized agents: the \emph{Extraction Agent} and the \emph{Text-to-SQL Agent}. The \textit{Extraction Agent} automatically identifies key performance indicators from unstructured financial text, standardizes their formats, and verifies their accuracy. On the other hand, the \textit{Text-to-SQL Agent} generates executable SQL statements from natural language queries, allowing users to access structured data accurately without requiring familiarity with the database schema. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed system effectively transforms unstructured text into structured data accurately and enables precise retrieval of key information. First, we demonstrate that our system achieves approximately 95\% accuracy in transforming financial filings into structured data, matching the performance level typically attained by human annotators. Second, in a human evaluation of the retrieval task -- where natural language queries are used to search information from structured data -- 91\% of the responses were rated as correct by human evaluators. In both evaluations, our system generalizes well across financial document types, consistently delivering reliable performance.

Abstract: Deep learning models, despite their popularity, face challenges such as long training times and a lack of interpretability. In contrast, fuzzy inference systems offer a balance of accuracy and transparency. This paper addresses the limitations of traditional Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy models by extending the recently proposed New Takagi-Sugeno-Kang model to a new Mamdani-based regressor. These models are data-driven, allowing users to define the number of rules to balance accuracy and interpretability. To handle the complexity of large datasets, this research integrates wrapper and ensemble techniques. A Genetic Algorithm is used as a wrapper for feature selection, creating genetic versions of the models. Furthermore, ensemble models, including the Random New Mamdani Regressor, Random New Takagi-Sugeno-Kang, and Random Forest New Takagi-Sugeno-Kang, are introduced to improve robustness. The proposed models are validated on photovoltaic energy forecasting datasets, a critical application due to the intermittent nature of solar power. Results demonstrate that the genetic and ensemble fuzzy models, particularly the Genetic New Takagi-Sugeno-Kang and Random Forest New Takagi-Sugeno-Kang, achieve superior performance. They often outperform both traditional machine learning and deep learning models while providing a simpler and more interpretable rule-based structure. The models are available online in a library called nfisis (https://pypi.org/project/nfisis/).

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful approach for trajectory planning. However, their inherently non-sequential nature limits their effectiveness in long-horizon reasoning tasks at test time. The recently proposed Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) offers a promising solution by combining diffusion with tree-based search, achieving state-of-the-art performance on complex planning problems. Despite its strengths, our analysis shows that MCTD incurs substantial computational overhead due to the sequential nature of tree search and the cost of iterative denoising. To address this, we propose Fast-MCTD, a more efficient variant that preserves the strengths of MCTD while significantly improving its speed and scalability. Fast-MCTD integrates two techniques: Parallel MCTD, which enables parallel rollouts via delayed tree updates and redundancy-aware selection; and Sparse MCTD, which reduces rollout length through trajectory coarsening. Experiments show that Fast-MCTD achieves up to 100x speedup over standard MCTD while maintaining or improving planning performance. Remarkably, it even outperforms Diffuser in inference speed on some tasks, despite Diffuser requiring no search and yielding weaker solutions. These results position Fast-MCTD as a practical and scalable solution for diffusion-based inference-time reasoning.

<title>Metis-RISE: RL Incentivizes and SFT Enhances Multimodal Reasoning Model Learning</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have witnessed a surge in the development of advanced reasoning paradigms, which are now being integrated into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing approaches often fall short: methods solely employing reinforcement learning (RL) can struggle with sample inefficiency and activating entirely absent reasoning capabilities, while conventional pipelines that initiate with a cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase before RL may restrict the model's exploratory capacity and face suboptimal convergence. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Metis-RISE} (\textbf{R}L \textbf{I}ncentivizes and \textbf{S}FT \textbf{E}nhances) for multimodal reasoning model learning. Unlike conventional approaches, Metis-RISE distinctively omits an initial SFT stage, beginning instead with an RL phase (e.g., using a Group Relative Policy Optimization variant) to incentivize and activate the model's latent reasoning capacity. Subsequently, the targeted SFT stage addresses two key challenges identified during RL: (1) \textit{inefficient trajectory sampling} for tasks where the model possesses but inconsistently applies correct reasoning, which we tackle using self-distilled reasoning trajectories from the RL model itself; and (2) \textit{fundamental capability absence}, which we address by injecting expert-augmented knowledge for prompts where the model entirely fails. This strategic application of RL for incentivization followed by SFT for enhancement forms the core of Metis-RISE, leading to two versions of our MLLMs (7B and 72B parameters). Evaluations on the OpenCompass Multimodal Reasoning Leaderboard demonstrate that both models achieve state-of-the-art performance among similar-sized models, with the 72B version ranking fourth overall.

Abstract: Since the advent of large language models, prompt engineering now enables the rapid, low-effort creation of diverse autonomous agents that are already in widespread use. Yet this convenience raises urgent concerns about the safety, robustness, and behavioral consistency of the underlying prompts, along with the pressing challenge of preventing those prompts from being exposed to user's attempts. In this paper, we propose the ''Doppelganger method'' to demonstrate the risk of an agent being hijacked, thereby exposing system instructions and internal information. Next, we define the ''Prompt Alignment Collapse under Adversarial Transfer (PACAT)'' level to evaluate the vulnerability to this adversarial transfer attack. We also propose a ''Caution for Adversarial Transfer (CAT)'' prompt to counter the Doppelganger method. The experimental results demonstrate that the Doppelganger method can compromise the agent's consistency and expose its internal information. In contrast, CAT prompts enable effective defense against this adversarial attack.

Abstract: While the integration of transformers in vision models have yielded significant improvements on vision tasks they still require significant amounts of computation for both training and inference. Restricted attention mechanisms significantly reduce these computational burdens but come at the cost of losing either global or local coherence. We propose a simple, yet powerful method to reduce these trade-offs: allow the attention heads of a single transformer to attend to multiple receptive fields.
  We demonstrate our method utilizing Neighborhood Attention (NA) and integrate it into a StyleGAN based architecture for image generation. With this work, dubbed StyleNAT, we are able to achieve a FID of 2.05 on FFHQ, a 6% improvement over StyleGAN-XL, while utilizing 28% fewer parameters and with 4$\times$ the throughput capacity. StyleNAT achieves the Pareto Frontier on FFHQ-256 and demonstrates powerful and efficient image generation on other datasets. Our code and model checkpoints are publicly available at: https://github.com/SHI-Labs/StyleNAT

<title>PuriDefense: Randomized Local Implicit Adversarial Purification for Defending Black-box Query-based Attacks</title>

Abstract: Black-box query-based attacks constitute significant threats to Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) systems since they can generate adversarial examples without accessing the target model's architecture and parameters. Traditional defense mechanisms, such as adversarial training, gradient masking, and input transformations, either impose substantial computational costs or compromise the test accuracy of non-adversarial inputs. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient defense mechanism, PuriDefense, that employs random patch-wise purifications with an ensemble of lightweight purification models at a low level of inference cost. These models leverage the local implicit function and rebuild the natural image manifold. Our theoretical analysis suggests that this approach slows down the convergence of query-based attacks by incorporating randomness into purifications. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet validate the effectiveness of our proposed purifier-based defense mechanism, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against query-based attacks.

Abstract: This article introduces the Membership Inference Test (MINT), a novel approach that aims to empirically assess if given data was used during the training of AI/ML models. Specifically, we propose two MINT architectures designed to learn the distinct activation patterns that emerge when an Audited Model is exposed to data used during its training process. These architectures are based on Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The experimental framework focuses on the challenging task of Face Recognition, considering three state-of-the-art Face Recognition systems. Experiments are carried out using six publicly available databases, comprising over 22 million face images in total. Different experimental scenarios are considered depending on the context of the AI model to test. Our proposed MINT approach achieves promising results, with up to 90\% accuracy, indicating the potential to recognize if an AI model has been trained with specific data. The proposed MINT approach can serve to enforce privacy and fairness in several AI applications, e.g., revealing if sensitive or private data was used for training or tuning Large Language Models (LLMs).

Abstract: Online recruitment platforms have reshaped job-seeking and recruiting processes, driving increased demand for applications that enhance person-job matching. Traditional methods generally rely on analyzing textual data from resumes and job descriptions, limiting the dynamic, interactive aspects crucial to effective recruitment. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revealed remarkable potential in simulating adaptive, role-based dialogues, making them well-suited for recruitment scenarios. In this paper, we propose \textbf{MockLLM}, a novel framework to generate and evaluate mock interview interactions. The system consists of two key components: mock interview generation and two-sided evaluation in handshake protocol. By simulating both interviewer and candidate roles, MockLLM enables consistent and collaborative interactions for real-time and two-sided matching. To further improve the matching quality, MockLLM further incorporates reflection memory generation and dynamic strategy modification, refining behaviors based on previous experience. We evaluate MockLLM on real-world data Boss Zhipin, a major Chinese recruitment platform. The experimental results indicate that MockLLM outperforms existing methods in matching accuracy, scalability, and adaptability across job domains, highlighting its potential to advance candidate assessment and online recruitment.

Abstract: In the last years, many learning-based approaches have been proposed to tackle combinatorial optimization problems such as routing problems. Many of these approaches are based on graph neural networks (GNNs) or related transformers, operating on the Euclidean coordinates representing the routing problems. However, models operating on Euclidean coordinates are ill-suited for non-Euclidean, asymmetric problem instances that are often found in real-world settings. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel GNN-based and edge-focused neural model called Graph Edge Attention Network (GREAT). Using GREAT as an encoder to capture the properties of a routing problem instance, we build a reinforcement learning framework which we apply to Euclidean and non-Euclidean variants of vehicle routing problems such as Traveling Salesman Problem, Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem and Orienteering Problem. Our framework is among the first to tackle non-Euclidean variants of these problems and achieves competitive results among learning-based solvers.

Abstract: Long-form video understanding presents unique challenges that extend beyond traditional short-video analysis approaches, particularly in capturing long-range dependencies, processing redundant information efficiently, and extracting high-level semantic concepts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that more accurately reflects human cognition. This paper introduces HERMES: temporal-coHERent long-forM understanding with Episodes and Semantics, featuring two versatile modules that can enhance existing video-language models or operate as a standalone system. Our Episodic COmpressor (ECO) efficiently aggregates representations from micro to semi-macro levels, reducing computational overhead while preserving temporal dependencies. Our Semantics ReTRiever (SeTR) enriches these representations with semantic information by focusing on broader context, dramatically reducing feature dimensionality while preserving relevant macro-level information. We demonstrate that these modules can be seamlessly integrated into existing SOTA models, consistently improving their performance while reducing inference latency by up to 43% and memory usage by 46%. As a standalone system, HERMES achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple long-video understanding benchmarks in both zero-shot and fully-supervised settings.

Abstract: Low-cost gyroscope calibration is essential for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of gyroscope measurements. Stationary calibration estimates the deterministic parts of measurement errors. To this end, a common practice is to average the gyroscope readings during a predefined period and estimate the gyroscope bias. Calibration duration plays a crucial role in performance, therefore, longer periods are preferred. However, some applications require quick startup times and calibration is therefore allowed only for a short time. In this work, we focus on reducing low-cost gyroscope calibration time using deep learning methods. We propose an end-to-end convolutional neural network for the application of gyroscope calibration. We explore the possibilities of using multiple real and virtual gyroscopes to improve the calibration performance of single gyroscopes. To train and validate our approach, we recorded a dataset consisting of 186.6 hours of gyroscope readings, using 36 gyroscopes of four different brands. We also created a virtual dataset consisting of simulated gyroscope readings. The six datasets were used to evaluate our proposed approach. One of our key achievements in this work is reducing gyroscope calibration time by up to 89% using three low-cost gyroscopes. Our dataset is publicly available to allow reproducibility of our work and to increase research in the field.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for extracting georeferenced vehicle trajectories from high-altitude drone imagery, addressing key challenges in urban traffic monitoring and the limitations of traditional ground-based systems. Our approach integrates several novel contributions, including a tailored object detector optimized for high-altitude bird's-eye view perspectives, a unique track stabilization method that uses detected vehicle bounding boxes as exclusion masks during image registration, and an orthophoto and master frame-based georeferencing strategy that enhances consistent alignment across multiple drone viewpoints. Additionally, our framework features robust vehicle dimension estimation and detailed road segmentation, enabling comprehensive traffic analysis. Conducted in the Songdo International Business District, South Korea, the study utilized a multi-drone experiment covering 20 intersections, capturing approximately 12TB of 4K video data over four days. The framework produced two high-quality datasets: the Songdo Traffic dataset, comprising approximately 700,000 unique vehicle trajectories, and the Songdo Vision dataset, containing over 5,000 human-annotated images with about 300,000 vehicle instances in four classes. Comparisons with high-precision sensor data from an instrumented probe vehicle highlight the accuracy and consistency of our extraction pipeline in dense urban environments. The public release of Songdo Traffic and Songdo Vision, and the complete source code for the extraction pipeline, establishes new benchmarks in data quality, reproducibility, and scalability in traffic research. Results demonstrate the potential of integrating drone technology with advanced computer vision for precise and cost-effective urban traffic monitoring, providing valuable resources for developing intelligent transportation systems and enhancing traffic management strategies.

<title>Prompting with Phonemes: Enhancing LLMs' Multilinguality for Non-Latin Script Languages</title>

Abstract: Although multilingual LLMs have achieved remarkable performance across benchmarks, we find they continue to underperform on non-Latin script languages across contemporary LLM families. This discrepancy arises from the fact that LLMs are pretrained with orthographic scripts, which are dominated by Latin characters that obscure their shared phonology with non-Latin scripts. We propose leveraging phonemic transcriptions as complementary signals to induce script-invariant representations. Our study demonstrates that integrating phonemic signals improves performance across both non-Latin and Latin script languages, with a particularly significant impact on closing the performance gap between the two. Through detailed experiments, we show that phonemic and orthographic scripts retrieve distinct examples for in-context learning (ICL). This motivates our proposed Mixed-ICL retrieval strategy, where further aggregation from both leads to our significant performance improvements for both Latin script languages (up to 12.6%) and non-Latin script languages (up to 15.1%) compared to randomized ICL retrieval.

Abstract: Click-through rate (CTR) prediction, which predicts the probability of a user clicking an ad, is a fundamental task in recommender systems. The emergence of heterogeneous information, such as user profile and behavior sequences, depicts user interests from different aspects. A mutually beneficial integration of heterogeneous information is the cornerstone towards the success of CTR prediction. However, most of the existing methods suffer from two fundamental limitations, including (1) insufficient inter-mode interaction due to the unidirectional information flow between modes, and (2) aggressive information aggregation caused by early summarization, resulting in excessive information loss. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel module named InterFormer to learn heterogeneous information interaction in an interleaving style. To achieve better interaction learning, InterFormer enables bidirectional information flow for mutually beneficial learning across different modes. To avoid aggressive information aggregation, we retain complete information in each data mode and use a separate bridging arch for effective information selection and summarization. Our proposed InterFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets and a large-scale industrial dataset.

Abstract: Open-set Domain Adaptation (OSDA) aims to adapt a model from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, where novel classes - also referred to as target-private unknown classes - are present. Source-free Open-set Domain Adaptation (SF-OSDA) methods address OSDA without accessing labeled source data, making them particularly relevant under privacy constraints. However, SF-OSDA presents significant challenges due to distribution shifts and the introduction of novel classes. Existing SF-OSDA methods typically rely on thresholding the prediction entropy of a sample to identify it as either a known or unknown class, but fail to explicitly learn discriminative features for the target-private unknown classes. We propose Recall and Refine (RRDA), a novel SF-OSDA framework designed to address these limitations by explicitly learning features for target-private unknown classes. RRDA employs a two-stage process. First, we enhance the model's capacity to recognize unknown classes by training a target classifier with an additional decision boundary,guided by synthetic samples generated from target domain features. This enables the classifier to effectively separate known and unknown classes. Second, we adapt the entire model to the target domain, addressing both domain shifts and distinguishability to unknown classes. Any off-the-shelf source-free domain adaptation method (e.g. SHOT, AaD) can be seamlessly integrated into our framework at this stage. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that RRDA significantly outperforms existing SF-OSDA and OSDA methods.

Abstract: Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is one of the most critical aspects of building a performant compound AI system. Since the output from LLMs propagate to downstream steps, identifying LLM errors is crucial to system performance. A common task for LLMs in AI systems is tool use. While there are several benchmark environments for evaluating LLMs on this task, they typically only give a success rate without any explanation of the failure cases. To solve this problem, we introduce TOOLSCAN, a new benchmark to identify error patterns in LLM output on tool-use tasks. Our benchmark data set comprises of queries from diverse environments that can be used to test for the presence of seven newly characterized error patterns. Using TOOLSCAN, we show that even the most prominent LLMs exhibit these error patterns in their outputs. Researchers can use these insights from TOOLSCAN to guide their error mitigation strategies.

Abstract: LLMs have shown impressive capabilities across various natural language processing tasks, yet remain vulnerable to input prompts, known as jailbreak attacks, carefully designed to bypass safety guardrails and elicit harmful responses. Traditional methods rely on manual heuristics but suffer from limited generalizability. Despite being automatic, optimization-based attacks often produce unnatural prompts that can be easily detected by safety filters or require high computational costs due to discrete token optimization. In this paper, we introduce Generative Adversarial Suffix Prompter (GASP), a novel automated framework that can efficiently generate human-readable jailbreak prompts in a fully black-box setting. In particular, GASP leverages latent Bayesian optimization to craft adversarial suffixes by efficiently exploring continuous latent embedding spaces, gradually optimizing the suffix prompter to improve attack efficacy while balancing prompt coherence via a targeted iterative refinement procedure. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that GASP can produce natural adversarial prompts, significantly improving jailbreak success over baselines, reducing training times, and accelerating inference speed, thus making it an efficient and scalable solution for red-teaming LLMs.

Abstract: CT report generation (CTRG) aims to automatically generate diagnostic reports for 3D volumes, relieving clinicians' workload and improving patient care. Despite clinical value, existing works fail to effectively incorporate diagnostic information from multiple anatomical views and lack related clinical expertise essential for accurate and reliable diagnosis. To resolve these limitations, we propose a novel Multi-view perception Knowledge-enhanced TansfoRmer (MvKeTR) to mimic the diagnostic workflow of clinicians. Just as radiologists first examine CT scans from multiple planes, a Multi-View Perception Aggregator (MVPA) with view-aware attention is proposed to synthesize diagnostic information from multiple anatomical views effectively. Then, inspired by how radiologists further refer to relevant clinical records to guide diagnostic decision-making, a Cross-Modal Knowledge Enhancer (CMKE) is devised to retrieve the most similar reports based on the query volume to incorporate domain knowledge into the diagnosis procedure. Furthermore, instead of traditional MLPs, we employ Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as the fundamental building blocks of both modules, which exhibit superior parameter efficiency and reduced spectral bias to better capture high-frequency components critical for CT interpretation while mitigating overfitting. Extensive experiments on the public CTRG-Chest-548 K dataset demonstrate that our method outpaces prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across almost all metrics.

Abstract: Recent generative models based on score matching and flow matching have significantly advanced generation tasks, but their potential in discriminative tasks remains underexplored. Previous approaches, such as generative classifiers, have not fully leveraged the capabilities of these models for discriminative tasks due to their intricate designs. We propose Pretrained Reversible Generation (PRG), which extracts unsupervised representations by reversing the generative process of a pretrained continuous generation model. PRG effectively reuses unsupervised generative models, leveraging their high capacity to serve as robust and generalizable feature extractors for downstream tasks. This framework enables the flexible selection of feature hierarchies tailored to specific downstream tasks. Our method consistently outperforms prior approaches across multiple benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance among generative model based methods, including 78% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet at a resolution of 64*64.

Abstract: We present InfiniCube, a scalable method for generating unbounded dynamic 3D driving scenes with high fidelity and controllability. Previous methods for scene generation either suffer from limited scales or lack geometric and appearance consistency along generated sequences. In contrast, we leverage the recent advancements in scalable 3D representation and video models to achieve large dynamic scene generation that allows flexible controls through HD maps, vehicle bounding boxes, and text descriptions. First, we construct a map-conditioned sparse-voxel-based 3D generative model to unleash its power for unbounded voxel world generation. Then, we re-purpose a video model and ground it on the voxel world through a set of carefully designed pixel-aligned guidance buffers, synthesizing a consistent appearance. Finally, we propose a fast feed-forward approach that employs both voxel and pixel branches to lift the dynamic videos to dynamic 3D Gaussians with controllable objects. Our method can generate controllable and realistic 3D driving scenes, and extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of our model.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models in creating highly realistic images poses substantial risks for misinformation dissemination. For instance, a synthetic image, when shared on social media, can mislead extensive audiences and erode trust in digital content, resulting in severe repercussions. Despite some progress, academia has not yet created a large and diversified deepfake detection dataset for social media, nor has it devised an effective solution to address this issue. In this paper, we introduce the Social media Image Detection dataSet (SID-Set), which offers three key advantages: (1) extensive volume, featuring 300K AI-generated/tampered and authentic images with comprehensive annotations, (2) broad diversity, encompassing fully synthetic and tampered images across various classes, and (3) elevated realism, with images that are predominantly indistinguishable from genuine ones through mere visual inspection. Furthermore, leveraging the exceptional capabilities of large multimodal models, we propose a new image deepfake detection, localization, and explanation framework, named SIDA (Social media Image Detection, localization, and explanation Assistant). SIDA not only discerns the authenticity of images, but also delineates tampered regions through mask prediction and provides textual explanations of the model's judgment criteria. Compared with state-of-the-art deepfake detection models on SID-Set and other benchmarks, extensive experiments demonstrate that SIDA achieves superior performance among diversified settings. The code, model, and dataset will be released.

<title>Lagrangian Index Policy for Restless Bandits with Average Reward</title>

arXiv:2412.12641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Lagrange Index Policy (LIP) for restless multi-armed bandits with long-run average reward. In particular, we compare the performance of LIP with the performance of the Whittle Index Policy (WIP), both heuristic policies known to be asymptotically optimal under certain natural conditions. Even though in most cases their performances are very similar, in the cases when WIP shows bad performance, LIP continues to perform very well. We then propose reinforcement learning algorithms, both tabular and NN-based, to obtain online learning schemes for LIP in the model-free setting. The proposed reinforcement learning schemes for LIP require significantly less memory than the analogous schemes for WIP. We calculate analytically the Lagrange index for the restart model, which applies to the optimal web crawling and the minimization of the weighted age of information. We also give a new proof of asymptotic optimality in case of homogeneous arms as the number of arms goes to infinity, based on exchangeability and de Finetti's theorem.

<title>Representation Learning of Lab Values via Masked AutoEncoders</title>

Abstract: Accurate imputation of missing laboratory values in electronic health records (EHRs) is critical to enable robust clinical predictions and reduce biases in AI systems in healthcare. Existing methods, such as XGBoost, softimpute, GAIN, Expectation Maximization (EM), and MICE, struggle to model the complex temporal and contextual dependencies in EHR data, particularly in underrepresented groups. In this work, we propose Lab-MAE, a novel transformer-based masked autoencoder framework that leverages self-supervised learning for the imputation of continuous sequential lab values. Lab-MAE introduces a structured encoding scheme that jointly models laboratory test values and their corresponding timestamps, enabling explicit capturing temporal dependencies. Empirical evaluation on the MIMIC-IV dataset demonstrates that Lab-MAE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as XGBoost, softimpute, GAIN, EM, and MICE across multiple metrics, including root mean square error (RMSE), R-squared (R2), and Wasserstein distance (WD). Notably, Lab-MAE achieves equitable performance across demographic groups of patients, advancing fairness in clinical predictions. We further investigate the role of follow-up laboratory values as potential shortcut features, revealing Lab-MAE's robustness in scenarios where such data is unavailable. The findings suggest that our transformer-based architecture, adapted to the characteristics of EHR data, offers a foundation model for more accurate and fair clinical imputation. In addition, we measure and compare the carbon footprint of Lab-MAE with the a XGBoost model, highlighting its environmental requirements.

Abstract: Achieving physically consistent image editing remains a significant challenge in computer vision. Existing image editing methods typically rely on neural networks, which struggle to accurately handle shadows and refractions. Conversely, physics-based inverse rendering often requires multi-view optimization, limiting its practicality in single-image scenarios. In this paper, we propose Materialist, a method combining a learning-based approach with physically based progressive differentiable rendering. Given an image, our method leverages neural networks to predict initial material properties. Progressive differentiable rendering is then used to optimize the environment map and refine the material properties with the goal of closely matching the rendered result to the input image. Our approach enables a range of applications, including material editing, object insertion, and relighting, while also introducing an effective method for editing material transparency without requiring full scene geometry. Furthermore, Our envmap estimation method also achieves state-of-the-art performance, further enhancing the accuracy of image editing task. Experiments demonstrate strong performance across synthetic and real-world datasets, excelling even on challenging out-of-domain images. Project website: https://lez-s.github.io/materialist_project/

<title>DisCoPatch: Taming Adversarially-driven Batch Statistics for Improved Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08005</link>

arXiv:2501.08005v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection holds significant importance across many applications. While semantic and domain-shift OOD problems are well-studied, this work focuses on covariate shifts - subtle variations in the data distribution that can degrade machine learning performance. We hypothesize that detecting these subtle shifts can improve our understanding of in-distribution boundaries, ultimately improving OOD detection. In adversarial discriminators trained with Batch Normalization (BN), real and adversarial samples form distinct domains with unique batch statistics - a property we exploit for OOD detection. We introduce DisCoPatch, an unsupervised Adversarial Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework that harnesses this mechanism. During inference, batches consist of patches from the same image, ensuring a consistent data distribution that allows the model to rely on batch statistics. DisCoPatch uses the VAE's suboptimal outputs (generated and reconstructed) as negative samples to train the discriminator, thereby improving its ability to delineate the boundary between in-distribution samples and covariate shifts. By tightening this boundary, DisCoPatch achieves state-of-the-art results in public OOD detection benchmarks. The proposed model not only excels in detecting covariate shifts, achieving 95.5% AUROC on ImageNet-1K(-C) but also outperforms all prior methods on public Near-OOD (95.0%) benchmarks. With a compact model size of 25MB, it achieves high OOD detection performance at notably lower latency than existing methods, making it an efficient and practical solution for real-world OOD detection applications. The code is publicly available.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have leveraged pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to improve the generalization capabilities. VLMs, typically pre-trained on vision-language understanding tasks, provide rich semantic knowledge and reasoning abilities. However, prior research has shown that VLMs often focus on high-level semantic content and neglect low-level features, limiting their ability to capture detailed spatial information and understand physical dynamics. These aspects, which are crucial for embodied control tasks, remain underexplored in existing pre-training paradigms. In this paper, we investigate the training paradigm for VLAs, and introduce \textbf{UP-VLA}, a \textbf{U}nified VLA model training with both multi-modal \textbf{U}nderstanding and future \textbf{P}rediction objectives, enhancing both high-level semantic comprehension and low-level spatial understanding. Experimental results show that UP-VLA achieves a 33% improvement on the Calvin ABC-D benchmark compared to the previous state-of-the-art method. Additionally, UP-VLA demonstrates improved success rates in real-world manipulation tasks, particularly those requiring precise spatial information.

<title>Reward-Guided Speculative Decoding for Efficient LLM Reasoning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2501.19324v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Reward-Guided Speculative Decoding (RSD), a novel framework aimed at improving the efficiency of inference in large language models (LLMs). RSD synergistically combines a lightweight draft model with a more powerful target model, incorporating a controlled bias to prioritize high-reward outputs, in contrast to existing speculative decoding methods that enforce strict unbiasedness. RSD employs a process reward model to evaluate intermediate decoding steps and dynamically decide whether to invoke the target model, optimizing the trade-off between computational cost and output quality. We theoretically demonstrate that a threshold-based mixture strategy achieves an optimal balance between resource utilization and performance. Extensive evaluations on challenging reasoning benchmarks, including Olympiad-level tasks, show that RSD delivers significant efficiency gains against decoding with the target model only (up to 4.4x fewer FLOPs), while achieving significant better accuracy than parallel decoding method on average (up to +3.5). These results highlight RSD as a robust and cost-effective approach for deploying LLMs in resource-intensive scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/BaohaoLiao/RSD.

<title>Markets with Heterogeneous Agents: Dynamics and Survival of Bayesian vs. No-Regret Learners</title>

arXiv:2502.08597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the performance of heterogeneous learning agents in asset markets with stochastic payoffs. Our main focus is on comparing Bayesian learners and no-regret learners who compete in markets and identifying the conditions under which each approach is more effective. Surprisingly, we find that low regret is not sufficient for survival: an agent can have regret as low as $O(\log T)$ but still vanish when competing against a Bayesian with a finite prior and any positive prior probability on the correct model. On the other hand, we show that Bayesian learning is fragile, while no-regret learning requires less knowledge of the environment and is therefore more robust. Motivated by the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches, we propose a balanced strategy for utilizing Bayesian updates that improves robustness and adaptability to distribution shifts, providing a step toward a best-of-both-worlds learning approach. The method is general, efficient, and easy to implement. Finally, we formally establish the relationship between the notions of survival and market dominance studied in economics and the framework of regret minimization, thus bridging these theories. More broadly, our work contributes to the understanding of dynamics with heterogeneous types of learning agents and their impact on markets.

arXiv:2503.03921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce CREStE, a scalable learning-based mapless navigation framework to address the open-world generalization and robustness challenges of outdoor urban navigation. Key to achieving this is learning perceptual representations that generalize to open-set factors (e.g. novel semantic classes, terrains, dynamic entities) and inferring expert-aligned navigation costs from limited demonstrations. CREStE addresses both these issues, introducing 1) a visual foundation model (VFM) distillation objective for learning open-set structured bird's-eye-view perceptual representations, and 2) counterfactual inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), a novel active learning formulation that uses counterfactual trajectory demonstrations to reason about the most important cues when inferring navigation costs. We evaluate CREStE on the task of kilometer-scale mapless navigation in a variety of city, offroad, and residential environments and find that it outperforms all state-of-the-art approaches with 70% fewer human interventions, including a 2-kilometer mission in an unseen environment with just 1 intervention; showcasing its robustness and effectiveness for long-horizon mapless navigation.

Abstract: Low-light and underwater videos suffer from poor visibility, low contrast, and high noise, necessitating enhancements in visual quality. However, existing approaches typically rely on paired ground truth, which limits their practicality and often fails to maintain temporal consistency. To overcome these obstacles, this paper introduces a novel zero-shot learning approach named Zero-TIG, leveraging the Retinex theory and optical flow techniques. The proposed network consists of an enhancement module and a temporal feedback module. The enhancement module comprises three subnetworks: low-light image denoising, illumination estimation, and reflection denoising. The temporal enhancement module ensures temporal consistency by incorporating histogram equalization, optical flow computation, and image warping to align the enhanced previous frame with the current frame, thereby maintaining continuity. Additionally, we address color distortion in underwater data by adaptively balancing RGB channels. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves low-light video enhancement without the need for paired training data, making it a promising and applicable method for real-world scenario enhancement.

<title>Revealing higher-order neural representations of uncertainty with the Noise Estimation through Reinforcement-based Diffusion (NERD) model</title>

arXiv:2503.14333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studies often aim to reveal ``first-order" representations (FORs), which encode aspects of an observer's environment, such as contents or structure. A less-common target is ``higher-order" representations (HORs), which are ``about" FORs -- e.g., their strength or uncertainty -- and which may contribute to learning. HORs about uncertainty are unlikely to be direct ``read-outs" of FOR characteristics, instead reflecting noisy estimation processes incorporating prior expectations about uncertainty, but how the brain represents such expected uncertainty distributions remains largely unexplored. Here, we study ``noise expectation" HORs using neural data from a task which may require the brain to learn about its own noise: decoded neurofeedback, wherein human subjects learn to volitionally produce target neural patterns. We develop and apply a Noise Estimation through Reinforcement-based Diffusion (NERD) model to characterize how brains may undertake this process, and show that NERD offers high explanatory power for human behavior.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various domains, but their effectiveness in financial decision-making remains inadequately evaluated. Current benchmarks primarily assess LLMs' understanding on financial documents rather than the ability to manage assets or dig out trading opportunities in dynamic market conditions. Despite the release of new benchmarks for evaluating diversified tasks on the financial domain, we identified four major problems in these benchmarks, which are data leakage, navel-gazing, over-intervention, and maintenance-hard. To pave the research gap, we introduce DeepFund, a comprehensive arena platform for evaluating LLM-based trading strategies in a live environment. Our approach implements a multi-agent framework where they serve as multiple key roles that realize the real-world investment decision processes. Moreover, we provide a web interface that visualizes LLMs' performance with fund investment metrics across different market conditions, enabling detailed comparative analysis. Through DeepFund, we aim to provide a more realistic and fair assessment on LLM's capabilities in fund investment, offering diversified insights and revealing their potential applications in real-world financial markets. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/HKUSTDial/DeepFund.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained significant attention due to their remarkable reasoning capabilities and proficiency in generalization. However, processing a large number of visual tokens and generating long-context outputs impose substantial computational overhead, leading to excessive demands for key-value (KV) cache. To address this critical bottleneck, we propose AirCache, a novel KV cache compression method aimed at accelerating LVLMs inference. This work systematically investigates the correlations between visual and textual tokens within the attention mechanisms of LVLMs. Our empirical analysis reveals considerable redundancy in cached visual tokens, wherein strategically eliminating these tokens preserves model performance while significantly accelerating context generation. Inspired by these findings, we introduce an elite observation window for assessing the importance of visual components in the KV cache, focusing on stable inter-modal relevancy modeling with enhanced multi-perspective consistency. Additionally, we develop an adaptive layer-wise budget allocation strategy that capitalizes on the strength and skewness of token importance distribution, showcasing superior efficiency compared to uniform allocation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to the full cache while retaining only 10% of visual KV cache, thereby reducing decoding latency by 29% to 66% across various batch size and prompt length of inputs. Notably, as cache retention rates decrease, our method exhibits increasing performance advantages over existing approaches.

<title>Towards Adaptive Memory-Based Optimization for Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), by integrating non-parametric knowledge from external knowledge bases into models, has emerged as a promising approach to enhancing response accuracy while mitigating factual errors and hallucinations. This method has been widely applied in tasks such as Question Answering (QA). However, existing RAG methods struggle with open-domain QA tasks because they perform independent retrieval operations and directly incorporate the retrieved information into generation without maintaining a summarizing memory or using adaptive retrieval strategies, leading to noise from redundant information and insufficient information integration. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive memory-based optimization for enhanced RAG (Amber) for open-domain QA tasks, which comprises an Agent-based Memory Updater, an Adaptive Information Collector, and a Multi-granular Content Filter, working together within an iterative memory updating paradigm. Specifically, Amber integrates and optimizes the language model's memory through a multi-agent collaborative approach, ensuring comprehensive knowledge integration from previous retrieval steps. It dynamically adjusts retrieval queries and decides when to stop retrieval based on the accumulated knowledge, enhancing retrieval efficiency and effectiveness. Additionally, it reduces noise by filtering irrelevant content at multiple levels, retaining essential information to improve overall model performance. We conduct extensive experiments on several open-domain QA datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method and its components. The source code is available \footnote{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Amber-B203/}.

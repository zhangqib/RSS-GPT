<div> Keywords: Noosemia, AI, intentionality, agency, LLM

Summary:
This paper introduces the concept of Noosemia, a cognitive-phenomenological pattern that arises from human interaction with generative AI systems, particularly in dialogic or multimodal exchanges. The authors propose a framework that explains how users attribute intentionality, agency, and interiority to AI systems based on linguistic performance, epistemic opacity, and technological complexity. They link meaning holism with the LLM Contextual Cognitive Field to show how LLMs construct meaning relationally, leading to coherence and a semblance of agency at the human-AI interface. Noosemia is compared to pareidolia, animism, the intentional stance, and the uncanny valley, highlighting its unique characteristics. The concept of a-noosemia is also introduced to describe the withdrawal of these projections. The paper concludes by discussing the philosophical, epistemological, and social implications of Noosemia and suggests future research directions.

- Introduction of Noosemia in human interaction with AI systems
- Framework explaining attribution of intentionality and agency to AI

Abstract: This paper introduces and formalizes Noosem\`ia, a novel cognitive-phenomenological pattern emerging from human interaction with generative AI systems, particularly those enabling dialogic or multimodal exchanges. We propose a multidisciplinary framework to explain how, under certain conditions, users attribute intentionality, agency, and even interiority to these systems - a process grounded not in physical resemblance, but in linguistic performance, epistemic opacity, and emergent technological complexity. By linking an LLM declination of meaning holism to our technical notion of the LLM Contextual Cognitive Field, we clarify how LLMs construct meaning relationally and how coherence and a simulacrum of agency arise at the human-AI interface. The analysis situates noosemia alongside pareidolia, animism, the intentional stance and the uncanny valley, distinguishing its unique characteristics. We also introduce a-noosemia to describe the phenomenological withdrawal of such projections. The paper concludes with reflections on the broader philosophical, epistemological and social implications of noosemic dynamics and directions for future research.

Summary:
The article discusses the challenge of grounding natural language instructions in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) operating on Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has improved spatial alignment, inefficient exploration hinders semantic alignment. To address this, the authors propose Adaptive Exploration Policy Optimization (AEPO) with a multi-answer generation strategy and an Adaptive Exploration Reward function. Their models, InfiGUI-G1-3B and InfiGUI-G1-7B, outperform the RLVR baseline on difficult benchmarks, showcasing improved generalization and semantic understanding. This demonstrates the effectiveness of AEPO in enhancing exploration and improving model performance in GUI grounding tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has propelled the development of autonomous agents that operate on Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) using pure visual input. A fundamental challenge is robustly grounding natural language instructions. This requires a precise spatial alignment, which accurately locates the coordinates of each element, and, more critically, a correct semantic alignment, which matches the instructions to the functionally appropriate UI element. Although Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven to be effective at improving spatial alignment for these MLLMs, we find that inefficient exploration bottlenecks semantic alignment, which prevent models from learning difficult semantic associations. To address this exploration problem, we present Adaptive Exploration Policy Optimization (AEPO), a new policy optimization framework. AEPO employs a multi-answer generation strategy to enforce broader exploration, which is then guided by a theoretically grounded Adaptive Exploration Reward (AER) function derived from first principles of efficiency eta=U/C. Our AEPO-trained models, InfiGUI-G1-3B and InfiGUI-G1-7B, establish new state-of-the-art results across multiple challenging GUI grounding benchmarks, achieving significant relative improvements of up to 9.0% against the naive RLVR baseline on benchmarks designed to test generalization and semantic understanding.

<div> Keywords: Artificial General Intelligence, Active Inference, Large Language Models, Safety, Belief representation

Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel framework for creating safe Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) by merging Active Inference principles with Large Language Models (LLMs). Traditional AI safety methods revolve around post-hoc interpretability and reward engineering, which have limitations. The proposed architecture integrates safety guarantees into the core design of the system through transparent belief representations and hierarchical value alignment. Utilizing natural language for belief representation allows for direct human oversight while maintaining computational feasibility. The multi-agent system implements Active Inference principles where agents self-organize, with safety constraints flowing hierarchically. Specific safety mechanisms include explicit separation of beliefs and preferences in natural language, bounded rationality through resource-aware free energy minimization, and compositional safety through modular agent structures. The research agenda focuses on validating the framework's safety properties through experiments using the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark. This approach promises safer AGI development without the need for retrofitting safety measures.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for developing safe Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) by combining Active Inference principles with Large Language Models (LLMs). We argue that traditional approaches to AI safety, focused on post-hoc interpretability and reward engineering, have fundamental limitations. We present an architecture where safety guarantees are integrated into the system's core design through transparent belief representations and hierarchical value alignment. Our framework leverages natural language as a medium for representing and manipulating beliefs, enabling direct human oversight while maintaining computational tractability. The architecture implements a multi-agent system where agents self-organize according to Active Inference principles, with preferences and safety constraints flowing through hierarchical Markov blankets. We outline specific mechanisms for ensuring safety, including: (1) explicit separation of beliefs and preferences in natural language, (2) bounded rationality through resource-aware free energy minimization, and (3) compositional safety through modular agent structures. The paper concludes with a research agenda centered on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark, proposing experiments to validate our framework's safety properties. Our approach offers a path toward AGI development that is inherently safer, rather than retrofitted with safety measures.

<div> Keywords: human minds, symbolic systems, neural networks, artificial intelligence, cognitive processes.

Summary:<br /><br /> The article argues that the abilities of modern neural networks and artificial intelligence systems resemble those of human minds in combining ideas, producing novelty, and learning quickly. This challenges the notion that human cognitive processes are solely symbolic in nature. While neural networks are typically trained on data from symbolic systems, they play a crucial role in understanding the abstract problems faced by human minds. The intersection of symbolic systems and neural networks suggests a new direction for research on the symbolic basis of human thought. The authors propose that studying how neural networks mimic human cognitive abilities can provide valuable insights into the nature of human intelligence and the role of symbolic systems in cognitive processes.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.05776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some of the strongest evidence that human minds should be thought about in terms of symbolic systems has been the way they combine ideas, produce novelty, and learn quickly. We argue that modern neural networks -- and the artificial intelligence systems built upon them -- exhibit similar abilities. This undermines the argument that the cognitive processes and representations used by human minds are symbolic, although the fact that these neural networks are typically trained on data generated by symbolic systems illustrates that such systems play an important role in characterizing the abstract problems that human minds have to solve. This argument leads us to offer a new agenda for research on the symbolic basis of human thought.

<div> Holistic-XAI, explanation, hypothesis testing, causal rating methods, traditional XAI<br />
Summary:<br />
Holistic-XAI (H-XAI) is a new framework that integrates causal rating methods with traditional XAI methods to provide a holistic approach to explainable AI. This framework allows stakeholders to ask questions, test hypotheses, and compare model behavior against random and biased baselines. H-XAI combines instance-level and global explanations to cater to stakeholder-specific goals, such as understanding individual decisions, evaluating group-level bias, or assessing robustness under perturbations. The framework addresses gaps in existing XAI methods by offering a comprehensive solution for explanation as an interactive, multi-method process. Two case studies in binary credit risk classification and financial time-series forecasting demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of H-XAI in addressing diverse stakeholder needs. <div>

Abstract: Current eXplainable AI (XAI) methods largely serve developers, often focusing on justifying model outputs rather than supporting diverse stakeholder needs. A recent shift toward Evaluative AI reframes explanation as a tool for hypothesis testing, but still focuses primarily on operational organizations. We introduce Holistic-XAI (H-XAI), a unified framework that integrates causal rating methods with traditional XAI methods to support explanation as an interactive, multi-method process. H-XAI allows stakeholders to ask a series of questions, test hypotheses, and compare model behavior against automatically constructed random and biased baselines. It combines instance-level and global explanations, adapting to each stakeholder's goals, whether understanding individual decisions, assessing group-level bias, or evaluating robustness under perturbations. We demonstrate the generality of our approach through two case studies spanning six scenarios: binary credit risk classification and financial time-series forecasting. H-XAI fills critical gaps left by existing XAI methods by combining causal ratings and post-hoc explanations to answer stakeholder-specific questions at both the individual decision level and the overall model level.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance and gain influence, the development of embodied AI has accelerated, drawing significant attention, particularly in navigation scenarios. Embodied navigation requires an agent to perceive, interact with, and adapt to its environment while moving toward a specified target in unfamiliar settings. However, the integration of embodied navigation into critical applications raises substantial safety concerns. Given their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments, ensuring the safety of such systems is critical. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of safety in embodied navigation from multiple perspectives, encompassing attack strategies, defense mechanisms, and evaluation methodologies. Beyond conducting a comprehensive examination of existing safety challenges, mitigation technologies, and various datasets and metrics that assess effectiveness and robustness, we explore unresolved issues and future research directions in embodied navigation safety. These include potential attack methods, mitigation strategies, more reliable evaluation techniques, and the implementation of verification frameworks. By addressing these critical gaps, this survey aims to provide valuable insights that can guide future research toward the development of safer and more reliable embodied navigation systems. Furthermore, the findings of this study have broader implications for enhancing societal safety and increasing industrial efficiency.

Summary:
The article introduces a Knowledge Graph-based framework for effective tool retrieval in the context of complex user queries. Traditional approaches of tool retrieval based on similarity between user queries and tool descriptions have limitations, especially for multi-step tasks. The proposed framework leverages ensembles of 1-hop ego tool graphs to model direct and indirect connections between tools, improving tool selection for multi-step tasks. Evaluation on a synthetic dataset shows that the tool graph-based method outperforms a non-KG baseline in terms of tool coverage. The results demonstrate that leveraging the structural information in a Knowledge Graph provides complementary signals to similarity matching, particularly for queries requiring sequential tool composition. <div>

Abstract: Effective tool retrieval is essential for AI agents to select from a vast array of tools when identifying and planning actions in the context of complex user queries. Despite its central role in planning, this aspect remains underexplored in the literature. Traditional approaches rely primarily on similarities between user queries and tool descriptions, which significantly limits retrieval accuracy, specifically when handling multi-step user requests. To address these limitations, we propose a Knowledge Graph (KG)-based tool retrieval framework that captures the semantic relationships between tools and their functional dependencies. Our retrieval algorithm leverages ensembles of 1-hop ego tool graphs to model direct and indirect connections between tools, enabling more comprehensive and contextual tool selection for multi-step tasks. We evaluate our approach on a synthetically generated internal dataset across six defined user classes, extending previous work on coherent dialogue synthesis and too retrieval benchmarks. Results demonstrate that our tool graph-based method achieves 91.85% tool coverage on the micro-average Complete Recall metric, compared to 89.26% for re-ranked semantic-lexical hybrid retrieval, the strongest non-KG baseline in our experiments. These findings support our hypothesis that the structural information in the KG provides complementary signals to pure similarity matching, particularly for queries requiring sequential tool composition.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces MedOrch, a framework for facilitating collaboration among multiple agents in medical decision-making tasks involving both language and vision modalities. It addresses the limitations of individual vision-language models (VLMs) by incorporating a mediator agent based on large language models (LLMs) to guide and enhance their interactions. By leveraging a variety of open-source VLMs, MedOrch demonstrates improved performance in answering medical vision questions through collaborative efforts. The study highlights the importance of mediator-guided multi-agent collaboration in advancing the field of medical multimodal intelligence. The results emphasize the effectiveness of combining diverse models without the need for additional training, showcasing the potential of heterogeneous model ensembles for complex medical workflows. The code for MedOrch will be shared publicly for further research and development. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.05996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex medical decision-making involves cooperative workflows operated by different clinicians. Designing AI multi-agent systems can expedite and augment human-level clinical decision-making. Existing multi-agent researches primarily focus on language-only tasks, yet their extension to multimodal scenarios remains challenging. A blind combination of diverse vision-language models (VLMs) can amplify an erroneous outcome interpretation. VLMs in general are less capable in instruction following and importantly self-reflection, compared to large language models (LLMs) of comparable sizes. This disparity largely constrains VLMs' ability in cooperative workflows. In this study, we propose MedOrch, a mediator-guided multi-agent collaboration framework for medical multimodal decision-making. MedOrch employs an LLM-based mediator agent that enables multiple VLM-based expert agents to exchange and reflect on their outputs towards collaboration. We utilize multiple open-source general-purpose and domain-specific VLMs instead of costly GPT-series models, revealing the strength of heterogeneous models. We show that the collaboration within distinct VLM-based agents can surpass the capabilities of any individual agent. We validate our approach on five medical vision question answering benchmarks, demonstrating superior collaboration performance without model training. Our findings underscore the value of mediator-guided multi-agent collaboration in advancing medical multimodal intelligence. Our code will be made publicly available.

HIMA, a new hierarchical multi-agent framework, combines specialized imitation learning agents with a meta-controller to address challenges in real-time strategic games like StarCraftII. Each agent learns a distinct strategy from expert demonstrations and generates structured action sequences, which the Strategic Planner then integrates into an adaptive plan aligning local decisions with long-term strategies. The TEXTSCII-ALL testbed covers all race match combinations in SC2. Empirical results demonstrate that HIMA surpasses existing approaches in strategic clarity, adaptability, and computational efficiency, showcasing the efficacy of combining specialized imitation modules with meta-level orchestration to develop versatile AI agents. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive action sequence prediction capabilities but often struggle with dynamic, long-horizon tasks such as real-time strategic games. In a game such as StarCraftII (SC2), agents need to manage resource constraints and adapt to evolving battlefield situations in a partially observable environment. This often overwhelms exisiting LLM-based approaches. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent framework that employs specialized imitation learning agents under a meta-controller called Strategic Planner (SP). By expert demonstrations, each specialized agent learns a distinctive strategy, such as aerial support or defensive maneuvers, and produces coherent, structured multistep action sequences. The SP then orchestrates these proposals into a single, environmentally adaptive plan that ensures local decisions aligning with long-term strategies. We call this HIMA (Hierarchical Imitation Multi-Agent). We also present TEXTSCII-ALL, a comprehensive SC2 testbed that encompasses all race match combinations in SC2. Our empirical results show that HIMA outperforms state of the arts in strategic clarity, adaptability, and computational efficiency, underscoring the potential of combining specialized imitation modules with meta-level orchestration to develop more robust, general-purpose AI agents.

Summary:<br /><br />Large Language Models (LLMs) are being utilized for structured resource allocation tasks within the framework of Participatory Budgeting. Three prompting strategies are employed for LLMs: greedy selection, direct optimization, and a hill-climbing-inspired refinement. The study evaluates LLMs' allocations against a utility-maximizing oracle and tests their ability to infer structured preferences from voter input or metadata without explicit votes. The results highlight the importance of prompt design and demonstrate that LLMs show promise in mechanism design with unstructured inputs. Additionally, the research addresses challenges in evaluating LLMs' reasoning due to data contamination and static benchmarks, providing insights into their potential for complex decision-making tasks. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to handle complex decision-making tasks, yet their ability to perform structured resource allocation remains underexplored. Evaluating their reasoning is also difficult due to data contamination and the static nature of existing benchmarks. We present a dual-purpose framework leveraging Participatory Budgeting (PB) both as (i) a practical setting for LLM-based resource allocation and (ii) an adaptive benchmark for evaluating their reasoning capabilities. We task LLMs with selecting project subsets under feasibility (e.g., budget) constraints via three prompting strategies: greedy selection, direct optimization, and a hill-climbing-inspired refinement. We benchmark LLMs' allocations against a utility-maximizing oracle. Interestingly, we also test whether LLMs can infer structured preferences from natural-language voter input or metadata, without explicit votes. By comparing allocations based on inferred preferences to those from ground-truth votes, we evaluate LLMs' ability to extract preferences from open-ended input. Our results underscore the role of prompt design and show that LLMs hold promise for mechanism design with unstructured inputs.

<div> cognitive imagination, human thinking, artificial intelligence, semantic models, probabilistic causal relationships

Summary:<br />
- Cognitive imagination is a crucial aspect of human thinking, allowing for the visualization of coherent systems of concepts and causal links.
- This type of imagination is essential for reasoning, decision making, and prediction, as it provides a semantic context for these processes.
- The role of cognitive imagination is currently undervalued in artificial intelligence, limiting its capabilities.
- Semantic models are proposed as a tool for simulating cognitive imagination, based on probabilistic causal relationships and the consistency of imaginary contexts.
- These models mimic cognitive imagination by ensuring coherence and holism in the manipulation of interrelated facts within a context. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.06062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cognitive imagination is a type of imagination that plays a key role in human thinking. It is not a ``picture-in-the-head'' imagination. It is a faculty to mentally visualize coherent and holistic systems of concepts and causal links that serve as semantic contexts for reasoning, decision making and prediction. Our position is that the role of cognitive imagination is still greatly underestimated, and this creates numerous problems and diminishes the current capabilities of AI. For instance, when reasoning, humans rely on imaginary contexts to retrieve background info. They also constantly return to the context for semantic verification that their reasoning is still reasonable. Thus, reasoning without imagination is blind. This paper is a call for greater attention to cognitive imagination as the next promising breakthrough in artificial intelligence. As an instrument for simulating cognitive imagination, we propose semantic models -- a new approach to mathematical models that can learn, like neural networks, and are based on probabilistic causal relationships. Semantic models can simulate cognitive imagination because they ensure the consistency of imaginary contexts and implement a glass-box approach that allows the context to be manipulated as a holistic and coherent system of interrelated facts glued together with causal relations.

Summary:
- The paper discusses the difficulty of finding an optimal decision tree to minimize classification error due to its NP-hard nature.
- Several anytime extensions of exact algorithms have been proposed to address this challenge but have not been systematically compared.
- The authors introduce CA-DL8.5, a generic and complete beam search algorithm that extends the DL8.5 framework, allowing for the integration of various heuristics and relaxation mechanisms.
- CA-DL8.5 combines efficient branch-and-bound pruning with a restart-based beam search that gradually relaxes criteria to improve solution quality.
- Empirical comparisons show that CA-DL8.5 using limited discrepancy heuristics consistently provides the best anytime performance, outperforming other variants and the Blossom algorithm while maintaining completeness and optimality guarantees.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.06064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding an optimal decision tree that minimizes classification error is known to be NP-hard. While exact algorithms based on MILP, CP, SAT, or dynamic programming guarantee optimality, they often suffer from poor anytime behavior -- meaning they struggle to find high-quality decision trees quickly when the search is stopped before completion -- due to unbalanced search space exploration. To address this, several anytime extensions of exact methods have been proposed, such as LDS-DL8.5, Top-k-DL8.5, and Blossom, but they have not been systematically compared, making it difficult to assess their relative effectiveness. In this paper, we propose CA-DL8.5, a generic, complete, and anytime beam search algorithm that extends the DL8.5 framework and unifies some existing anytime strategies. In particular, CA-DL8.5 generalizes previous approaches LDS-DL8.5 and Top-k-DL8.5, by allowing the integration of various heuristics and relaxation mechanisms through a modular design. The algorithm reuses DL8.5's efficient branch-and-bound pruning and trie-based caching, combined with a restart-based beam search that gradually relaxes pruning criteria to improve solution quality over time. Our contributions are twofold: (1) We introduce this new generic framework for exact and anytime decision tree learning, enabling the incorporation of diverse heuristics and search strategies; (2) We conduct a rigorous empirical comparison of several instantiations of CA-DL8.5 -- based on Purity, Gain, Discrepancy, and Top-k heuristics -- using an anytime evaluation metric called the primal gap integral. Experimental results on standard classification benchmarks show that CA-DL8.5 using LDS (limited discrepancy) consistently provides the best anytime performance, outperforming both other CA-DL8.5 variants and the Blossom algorithm while maintaining completeness and optimality guarantees.

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel approach to autonomous driving using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with bird's-eye view (BEV) perception. The Mamba-BEV model combines BEV-based perception with the Mamba framework for effective feature extraction. This integration allows for encoding vehicle surroundings and road features in a unified coordinate system and modeling long-range dependencies accurately. The ME^3-BEV framework utilizes the Mamba-BEV model for end-to-end DRL, showing better performance in dynamic urban driving situations. The model's interpretability is enhanced through visualizing high-dimensional features with semantic segmentation, providing insight into learned representations. Extensive experiments on the CARLA simulator demonstrate that the ME^3-BEV outperforms existing models in collision rate and trajectory accuracy, showing promise for real-time autonomous driving.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems face significant challenges in perceiving complex environments and making real-time decisions. Traditional modular approaches, while offering interpretability, suffer from error propagation and coordination issues, whereas end-to-end learning systems can simplify the design but face computational bottlenecks. This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous driving using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that integrates bird's-eye view (BEV) perception for enhanced real-time decision-making. We introduce the \texttt{Mamba-BEV} model, an efficient spatio-temporal feature extraction network that combines BEV-based perception with the Mamba framework for temporal feature modeling. This integration allows the system to encode vehicle surroundings and road features in a unified coordinate system and accurately model long-range dependencies. Building on this, we propose the \texttt{ME$^3$-BEV} framework, which utilizes the \texttt{Mamba-BEV} model as a feature input for end-to-end DRL, achieving superior performance in dynamic urban driving scenarios. We further enhance the interpretability of the model by visualizing high-dimensional features through semantic segmentation, providing insight into the learned representations. Extensive experiments on the CARLA simulator demonstrate that \texttt{ME$^3$-BEV} outperforms existing models across multiple metrics, including collision rate and trajectory accuracy, offering a promising solution for real-time autonomous driving.

Summary: 
This paper addresses the question of the logical expressiveness of aggregate-combine-readout Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in relation to the graded modal logic C2. Building on previous research, the authors show that the logical expressiveness of aggregate-combine-readout GNNs surpasses that of C2, solving an open problem in the field. This result applies to both undirected and directed graphs, providing insights not only into the capabilities of GNNs but also into the expressive power of infinitary logics. The study contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between GNNs and logical languages, shedding light on the capabilities and limitations of these AI models. <div>

Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) by relating them to logical languages. This research has been been initialised by an influential result of Barcel\'o et al. (2020), who showed that the graded modal logic (or a guarded fragment of the logic C2), characterises the logical expressiveness of aggregate-combine GNNs. As a ``challenging open problem'' they left the question whether full C2 characterises the logical expressiveness of aggregate-combine-readout GNNs. This question has remained unresolved despite several attempts. In this paper, we solve the above open problem by proving that the logical expressiveness of aggregate-combine-readout GNNs strictly exceeds that of C2. This result holds over both undirected and directed graphs. Beyond its implications for GNNs, our work also leads to purely logical insights on the expressive power of infinitary logics.

Abstract: Table reasoning, including tabular QA and fact verification, often depends on annotated data or complex data augmentation, limiting flexibility and generalization. LLMs, despite their versatility, often underperform compared to simple supervised models. To approach these issues, we introduce PanelTR, a framework utilizing LLM agent scientists for robust table reasoning through a structured scientific approach. PanelTR's workflow involves agent scientists conducting individual investigations, engaging in self-review, and participating in collaborative peer-review discussions. This process, driven by five scientist personas, enables semantic-level transfer without relying on data augmentation or parametric optimization. Experiments across four benchmarks show that PanelTR outperforms vanilla LLMs and rivals fully supervised models, all while remaining independent of training data. Our findings indicate that structured scientific methodology can effectively handle complex tasks beyond table reasoning with flexible semantic understanding in a zero-shot context.

<title>SKATE, a Scalable Tournament Eval: Weaker LLMs differentiate between stronger ones using verifiable challenges</title>

<div> Keywords: evaluation framework, large language models, verifiable tasks, scalability, automated

Summary:<br /><br />Evaluating large language models (LLMs) is crucial, but current methods are hindered by the need for domain expertise. To address this, SKATE introduces a novel evaluation framework where LLMs compete by generating and solving verifiable tasks for each other. This approach treats evaluation as a game, with models acting as task-setters and solvers. SKATE offers scalability, objectivity, and open-endedness, as it is fully automated, data-free, and scalable without requiring human input. By using verifiable tasks and a TrueSkill-based ranking system, SKATE can accurately differentiate between models and highlight their strengths and weaknesses. The framework reveals that weaker models can distinguish and score stronger ones, LLM-based systems exhibit self-preferencing behavior, and SKATE automatically identifies fine-grained capability differences. This innovative approach represents a significant step towards developing general and scalable evaluation frameworks for keeping pace with LLM progress.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.06111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating the capabilities and risks of foundation models is paramount, yet current methods demand extensive domain expertise, hindering their scalability as these models rapidly evolve. We introduce SKATE: a novel evaluation framework in which large language models (LLMs) compete by generating and solving verifiable tasks for one another. Our core insight is to treat evaluation as a game: models act as both task-setters and solvers, incentivized to create questions which highlight their own strengths while exposing others' weaknesses. SKATE offers several key advantages, balancing scalability, open-endedness, and objectivity. It is fully automated, data-free, and scalable, requiring no human input or domain expertise. By using verifiable tasks rather than LLM judges, scoring is objective. Unlike domain-limited programmatically-generated benchmarks (e.g. chess-playing or spatial reasoning), having LLMs creatively pose challenges enables open-ended and scalable evaluation. As a proof of concept, we introduce LLM-set code-output-prediction (COP) challenges as a verifiable and extensible framework in which to test our approach. Using a TrueSkill-based ranking system, we evaluate six frontier LLMs and find that: (1) weaker models can reliably differentiate and score stronger ones, (2) LLM-based systems are capable of self-preferencing behavior, generating questions that align with their own capabilities, and (3) SKATE automatically surfaces fine-grained capability differences between models. Our findings are an important step towards general, scalable evaluation frameworks which can keep pace with LLM progress.

Summary:
This study explores the use of machine learning methods to improve metaheuristic algorithms for solving the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). By conducting a sensitivity analysis with multiple classifier models, the researchers identify key features that predict the quality of VRP solutions. They leverage explainable AI to gain insights into how these models make decisions and propose a unified framework for ranking feature impact across different scenarios. The findings reveal that certain features consistently emerge as strong predictors, highlighting the potential of feature importance analysis in guiding the development of more efficient VRP-solving algorithms. <div>

Abstract: The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a complex optimization problem with numerous real-world applications, mostly solved using metaheuristic algorithms due to its $\mathcal{NP}$-Hard nature. Traditionally, these metaheuristics rely on human-crafted designs developed through empirical studies. However, recent research shows that machine learning methods can be used the structural characteristics of solutions in combinatorial optimization, thereby aiding in designing more efficient algorithms, particularly for solving VRP. Building on this advancement, this study extends the previous research by conducting a sensitivity analysis using multiple classifier models that are capable of predicting the quality of VRP solutions. Hence, by leveraging explainable AI, this research is able to extend the understanding of how these models make decisions. Finally, our findings indicate that while feature importance varies, certain features consistently emerge as strong predictors. Furthermore, we propose a unified framework able of ranking feature impact across different scenarios to illustrate this finding. These insights highlight the potential of feature importance analysis as a foundation for developing a guidance mechanism of metaheuristic algorithms for solving the VRP.

Abstract: The versatility of large language models (LLMs) has been explored across various sectors, but their application in healthcare poses challenges, particularly in the domain of pharmaceutical contraindications where accurate and reliable information is required. This study enhances the capability of LLMs to address contraindications effectively by implementing a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. Utilizing OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini as the base model, and the text-embedding-3-small model for embeddings, our approach integrates Langchain to orchestrate a hybrid retrieval system with re-ranking. This system leverages Drug Utilization Review (DUR) data from public databases, focusing on contraindications for specific age groups, pregnancy, and concomitant drug use. The dataset includes 300 question-answer pairs across three categories, with baseline model accuracy ranging from 0.49 to 0.57. Post-integration of the RAG pipeline, we observed a significant improvement in model accuracy, achieving rates of 0.94, 0.87, and 0.89 for contraindications related to age groups, pregnancy, and concomitant drug use, respectively. The results indicate that augmenting LLMs with a RAG framework can substantially reduce uncertainty in prescription and drug intake decisions by providing more precise and reliable drug contraindication information.

Summary:
The paper discusses the importance of well-calibrated confidence in Large Language Models (LLMs) used as automated judges. It highlights the issue of the Overconfidence Phenomenon in current LLM-as-a-Judges, where predicted confidence exceeds actual correctness, leading to unreliable judgments. The proposed TH-Score metric quantifies this phenomenon, while the LLM-as-a-Fuser ensemble framework aims to improve calibration and reliability in evaluation pipelines. Experimental results show that the approach enhances confidence-driven evaluation, achieving better accuracy and reliability compared to existing methods. Overall, the paper advocates for a shift towards confidence-driven, risk-aware LLM-as-a-Judge systems to ensure trustworthy and adaptive evaluations. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.06225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used as automated judges, where practical value depends on both accuracy and trustworthy, risk-aware judgments. Existing approaches predominantly focus on accuracy, overlooking the necessity of well-calibrated confidence, which is vital for adaptive and reliable evaluation pipelines. In this work, we advocate a shift from accuracy-centric evaluation to confidence-driven, risk-aware LLM-as-a-Judge systems, emphasizing the necessity of well-calibrated confidence for trustworthy and adaptive evaluation. We systematically identify the **Overconfidence Phenomenon** in current LLM-as-a-Judges, where predicted confidence significantly overstates actual correctness, undermining reliability in practical deployment. To quantify this phenomenon, we introduce **TH-Score**, a novel metric measuring confidence-accuracy alignment. Furthermore, we propose **LLM-as-a-Fuser**, an ensemble framework that transforms LLMs into reliable, risk-aware evaluators. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially improves calibration and enables adaptive, confidence-driven evaluation pipelines, achieving superior reliability and accuracy compared to existing baselines.

Summary: 
The study introduces the GeoLaux benchmark to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models' (MLLMs) geometry skills. The benchmark consists of 2,186 geometry problems, including calculation and proving questions. It necessitates an average of 6.51 reasoning steps, with auxiliary line construction in 41.8% of the problems. The evaluation strategy encompasses answer correctness, process correctness, process quality, auxiliary line impact, and error causes. The experiments on 13 MLLMs reveal significant performance drops in extended reasoning steps, models taking shortcuts in solving proving problems, and lack of auxiliary line awareness. Enhancing auxiliary line capabilities proves beneficial for overall geometry reasoning improvement. This work establishes GeoLaux as a comprehensive benchmark for MLLMs' geometric reasoning with auxiliary lines, providing insights for capability advancement. <div>
arXiv:2508.06226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometry problem solving (GPS) requires models to master diagram comprehension, logical reasoning, knowledge application, numerical computation, and auxiliary line construction. This presents a significant challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLM geometry skills overlook auxiliary line construction and lack fine-grained process evaluation, making them insufficient for assessing MLLMs' long-step reasoning abilities. To bridge these gaps, we present the GeoLaux benchmark, comprising 2,186 geometry problems, incorporating both calculation and proving questions. Notably, the problems require an average of 6.51 reasoning steps, with a maximum of 24 steps, and 41.8% of them need auxiliary line construction. Building on the dataset, we design a novel five-dimensional evaluation strategy assessing answer correctness, process correctness, process quality, auxiliary line impact, and error causes. Extensive experiments on 13 leading MLLMs (including thinking models and non-thinking models) yield three pivotal findings: First, models exhibit substantial performance degradation in extended reasoning steps (nine models demonstrate over 50% performance drop). Second, compared to calculation problems, MLLMs tend to take shortcuts when solving proving problems. Third, models lack auxiliary line awareness, and enhancing this capability proves particularly beneficial for overall geometry reasoning improvement. These findings establish GeoLaux as both a benchmark for evaluating MLLMs' long-step geometric reasoning with auxiliary lines and a guide for capability advancement. Our dataset and code are included in supplementary materials and will be released.

Summary: 
The article introduces a Bayesian inductive logic programming approach that learns minimum message length programs from noisy data. This approach balances hypothesis complexity and data fit using priors that favor more general programs and a likelihood that favors accurate programs. In experiments across various domains such as game playing and drug design, the method outperforms previous approaches, particularly those based on learning minimum description length programs.

Abstract: Unifying probabilistic and logical learning is a key challenge in AI. We introduce a Bayesian inductive logic programming approach that learns minimum message length programs from noisy data. Our approach balances hypothesis complexity and data fit through priors, which explicitly favour more general programs, and a likelihood that favours accurate programs. Our experiments on several domains, including game playing and drug design, show that our method significantly outperforms previous methods, notably those that learn minimum description length programs. Our results also show that our approach is data-efficient and insensitive to example balance, including the ability to learn from exclusively positive examples.

Summary:
Inductive logic programming aims to find a hypothesis that can generalize training data and background knowledge. The main challenge lies in the vast hypothesis space and the existence of logically equivalent hypotheses. This paper introduces a method to overcome these challenges by breaking symmetries in the hypothesis space using answer set programming. Experimental results in various domains, such as visual reasoning and game playing, demonstrate that this approach significantly reduces solving times, from over an hour to just 17 seconds. This breakthrough in streamlining the search for hypotheses has the potential to improve efficiency and effectiveness in tasks that rely on inductive logic programming.

We introduce PRISM Eval Behavior Elicitation Tool (BET), an AI system performing automated red-teaming through Dynamic Adversarial Optimization that achieves 100% Attack Success Rate (ASR) against 37 of 41 state-of-the-art LLMs. Beyond binary success metrics, we propose a fine-grained robustness metric estimating the average number of attempts required to elicit harmful behaviors, revealing that attack difficulty varies by over 300-fold across models despite universal vulnerability. We introduce primitive-level vulnerability analysis to identify which jailbreaking techniques are most effective for specific hazard categories. Our collaborative evaluation with trusted third parties from the AI Safety Network demonstrates practical pathways for distributed robustness assessment across the community.

<div> belief updating, regulation task, model, observer, environment

Summary:
The article challenges Conant and Ashby's theorem that every good regulator must be a model of the system by introducing the concept of belief updating by an observer. It suggests that whenever an agent performs a regulation task, an observer can interpret it as having beliefs about its environment and updating these beliefs in response to sensory input. This perspective offers a more sophisticated notion of a model than Conant and Ashby's, implying that models are imposed on systems from outside by observers. The theorem proposed in this new framework is applicable regardless of whether the system is regulating its environment or internal state. Even apparent counterexamples to the original theorem can be resolved by considering the model of the environment, which may be trivial. This shift in perspective acknowledges the crucial role of the observer in determining and interpreting models within systems. <div>
arXiv:2508.06326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a classic paper, Conant and Ashby claimed that "every good regulator of a system must be a model of that system." Artificial Life has produced many examples of systems that perform tasks with apparently no model in sight; these suggest Conant and Ashby's theorem doesn't easily generalise beyond its restricted setup. Nevertheless, here we show that a similar intuition can be fleshed out in a different way: whenever an agent is able to perform a regulation task, it is possible for an observer to interpret it as having "beliefs" about its environment, which it "updates" in response to sensory input. This notion of belief updating provides a notion of model that is more sophisticated than Conant and Ashby's, as well as a theorem that is more broadly applicable. However, it necessitates a change in perspective, in that the observer plays an essential role in the theory: models are not a mere property of the system but are imposed on it from outside. Our theorem holds regardless of whether the system is regulating its environment in a classic control theory setup, or whether it's regulating its own internal state; the model is of its environment either way. The model might be trivial, however, and this is how the apparent counterexamples are resolved.

Abstract: Cheating in online video games compromises the integrity of gaming experiences. Anti-cheat systems, such as VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat), face significant challenges in keeping pace with evolving cheating methods without imposing invasive measures on users' systems. This paper presents AntiCheatPT\_256, a transformer-based machine learning model designed to detect cheating behaviour in Counter-Strike 2 using gameplay data. To support this, we introduce and publicly release CS2CD: A labelled dataset of 795 matches. Using this dataset, 90,707 context windows were created and subsequently augmented to address class imbalance. The transformer model, trained on these windows, achieved an accuracy of 89.17\% and an AUC of 93.36\% on an unaugmented test set. This approach emphasizes reproducibility and real-world applicability, offering a robust baseline for future research in data-driven cheat detection.

Summary: Current approaches to explainable AI (XAI) focus on algorithmic transparency, but often fail to provide meaningful explanations for end-users. This paper introduces Explanatory AI as a new paradigm that leverages generative AI to act as partners in explaining AI decisions to humans. Unlike XAI, Explanatory AI emphasizes contextual reasoning to support human decision-making in sociotechnical contexts. The authors propose a systematic eight-dimensional conceptual model that highlights the importance of narrative communication, adaptive personalization, and progressive disclosure in explanations. Empirical validation with healthcare professionals shows a preference for context-sensitive, multimodal explanations over technical transparency. The study suggests a need for AI systems designed for human comprehension rather than algorithmic introspection, calling for a research agenda to advance user-centered AI explanations across various domains and cultural contexts. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Current explainable AI (XAI) approaches prioritize algorithmic transparency and present explanations in abstract, non-adaptive formats that often fail to support meaningful end-user understanding. This paper introduces "Explanatory AI" as a complementary paradigm that leverages generative AI capabilities to serve as explanatory partners for human understanding rather than providers of algorithmic transparency. While XAI reveals algorithmic decision processes for model validation, Explanatory AI addresses contextual reasoning to support human decision-making in sociotechnical contexts. We develop a definition and systematic eight-dimensional conceptual model distinguishing Explanatory AI through narrative communication, adaptive personalization, and progressive disclosure principles. Empirical validation through Rapid Contextual Design methodology with healthcare professionals demonstrates that users consistently prefer context-sensitive, multimodal explanations over technical transparency. Our findings reveal the practical urgency for AI systems designed for human comprehension rather than algorithmic introspection, establishing a comprehensive research agenda for advancing user-centered AI explanation approaches across diverse domains and cultural contexts.

Summary: 
Legal Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are essential for facilitating access to comprehensive legal information and supporting the decision-making process in legal cases. This study addresses the lack of legal KGs by developing a legal KG focusing on cases of violence against women. Two approaches, a bottom-up methodology tailored for the legal domain and a new solution using Large Language Models, were employed to construct the KGs. By integrating structured data extraction, ontology development, and semantic enrichment, the developed KGs provide a valuable resource for legal experts and machine learning applications. The validation of the KGs through competency questions further enhances their reliability and usefulness. This work contributes to improving the accessibility of legal information, enabling complex queries, and potentially supporting predictive justice tools. <div>

Abstract: Legal decision-making process requires the availability of comprehensive and detailed legislative background knowledge and up-to-date information on legal cases and related sentences/decisions. Legal Knowledge Graphs (KGs) would be a valuable tool to facilitate access to legal information, to be queried and exploited for the purpose, and to enable advanced reasoning and machine learning applications. Indeed, legal KGs may act as knowledge intensive component to be used by pre-dictive machine learning solutions supporting the decision process of the legal expert. Nevertheless, a few KGs can be found in the legal domain. To fill this gap, we developed a legal KG targeting legal cases of violence against women, along with clear adopted methodologies. Specifically, the paper introduces two complementary approaches for automated legal KG construction; a systematic bottom-up approach, customized for the legal domain, and a new solution leveraging Large Language Models. Starting from legal sentences publicly available from the European Court of Justice, the solutions integrate structured data extraction, ontology development, and semantic enrichment to produce KGs tailored for legal cases involving violence against women. After analyzing and comparing the results of the two approaches, the developed KGs are validated via suitable competency questions. The obtained KG may be impactful for multiple purposes: can improve the accessibility to legal information both to humans and machine, can enable complex queries and may constitute an important knowledge component to be possibly exploited by machine learning tools tailored for predictive justice.

<div> Keywords: Fair Machine Learning, bias, Fair Game, Auditor, Debiasing algorithm

Summary:
Fair Machine Learning (ML) seeks to address bias in algorithmic predictions. Existing bias definitions rely on observational data and can only be applied after deployment, creating a gap in real-time fairness. "Fair Game" introduces a dynamic mechanism for ensuring fairness in ML predictions by combining an Auditor and a Debiasing algorithm in a Reinforcement Learning loop. This framework allows for adaptive fairness goals by modifying the auditor and biases quantified. By simulating the evolution of ethical and legal frameworks in society, "Fair Game" enables the development of flexible and adaptive Fair ML systems both pre- and post-deployment. <div>

Abstract: An emerging field of AI, namely Fair Machine Learning (ML), aims to quantify different types of bias (also known as unfairness) exhibited in the predictions of ML algorithms, and to design new algorithms to mitigate them. Often, the definitions of bias used in the literature are observational, i.e. they use the input and output of a pre-trained algorithm to quantify a bias under concern. In reality,these definitions are often conflicting in nature and can only be deployed if either the ground truth is known or only in retrospect after deploying the algorithm. Thus,there is a gap between what we want Fair ML to achieve and what it does in a dynamic social environment. Hence, we propose an alternative dynamic mechanism,"Fair Game",to assure fairness in the predictions of an ML algorithm and to adapt its predictions as the society interacts with the algorithm over time. "Fair Game" puts together an Auditor and a Debiasing algorithm in a loop around an ML algorithm. The "Fair Game" puts these two components in a loop by leveraging Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL algorithms interact with an environment to take decisions, which yields new observations (also known as data/feedback) from the environment and in turn, adapts future decisions. RL is already used in algorithms with pre-fixed long-term fairness goals. "Fair Game" provides a unique framework where the fairness goals can be adapted over time by only modifying the auditor and the different biases it quantifies. Thus,"Fair Game" aims to simulate the evolution of ethical and legal frameworks in the society by creating an auditor which sends feedback to a debiasing algorithm deployed around an ML system. This allows us to develop a flexible and adaptive-over-time framework to build Fair ML systems pre- and post-deployment.

<div> Keywords: Committee-selection problems, multi-winner voting rules, axioms, preference distributions, neural networks

Summary: 
Committee-selection problems are prevalent in various applications, prompting interest in the social choice research community to assess multi-winner voting rules' adherence to axioms. A new data-driven framework is proposed to evaluate the frequency of axiom violations across diverse preference distributions, moving beyond traditional worst-case analysis. By applying this framework, the relationship between voting rules and their axiomatic performance across multiple preference distributions is examined. Surprisingly, neural networks as voting rules exhibit superior performance in minimizing axiom violations compared to traditional rules. These findings suggest that leveraging data-driven approaches in social choice can enhance the development of novel voting systems and advocate for the continued exploration of data-driven research in social choice. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Committee-selection problems arise in many contexts and applications, and there has been increasing interest within the social choice research community on identifying which properties are satisfied by different multi-winner voting rules. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework to evaluate how frequently voting rules violate axioms across diverse preference distributions in practice, shifting away from the binary perspective of axiom satisfaction given by worst-case analysis. Using this framework, we analyze the relationship between multi-winner voting rules and their axiomatic performance under several preference distributions. We then show that neural networks, acting as voting rules, can outperform traditional rules in minimizing axiom violations. Our results suggest that data-driven approaches to social choice can inform the design of new voting systems and support the continuation of data-driven research in social choice.

<div> Keywords: pandemic, interventions, optimization, policy, simulation

Summary:
In response to the pandemic, various measures have been implemented such as lockdowns, vaccination programs, school closures, and economic stimulus. However, these interventions can have both positive and unintended negative consequences. Current research on determining optimal interventions is limited by simulation objectives, scale, model types, and the number of strategies explored. To address these challenges, a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) based policy optimization framework was utilized on a large-scale epidemiological agent-based simulation. Multi-objective optimization was performed to determine the optimal policy for lockdown and vaccination in a minimalist age-stratified multi-vaccine scenario. Results showed that a balance between economic well-being and health objectives could be achieved with no lockdown and vaccination for mid-age and elderly individuals. Further validation of these results through in-depth simulations is necessary, and the framework used in this study will be made open-source.

Abstract: To mitigate the impact of the pandemic, several measures include lockdowns, rapid vaccination programs, school closures, and economic stimulus. These interventions can have positive or unintended negative consequences. Current research to model and determine an optimal intervention automatically through round-tripping is limited by the simulation objectives, scale (a few thousand individuals), model types that are not suited for intervention studies, and the number of intervention strategies they can explore (discrete vs continuous). We address these challenges using a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) based policy optimization framework on a large-scale (100,000 individual) epidemiological agent-based simulation where we perform multi-objective optimization. We determine the optimal policy for lockdown and vaccination in a minimalist age-stratified multi-vaccine scenario with a basic simulation for economic activity. With no lockdown and vaccination (mid-age and elderly), results show optimal economy (individuals below the poverty line) with balanced health objectives (infection, and hospitalization). An in-depth simulation is needed to further validate our results and open-source our framework.

<div> Keywords: SHACL, OWL, RDF data, ontologies, validation <br />

Summary:
This paper discusses the differences between SHACL and OWL, two W3C standards for managing RDF data. While OWL is designed for inferring facts from incomplete data with an open-world assumption, SHACL functions as a constraint language under the closed-world assumption. The combination of both languages has been called for, but the semantic gap between them poses challenges both semantically and computationally. The authors propose a semantics for SHACL validation in the presence of ontologies using core universal models in the description logic Horn-ALCHIQ. They present a technique for constructing these models and a rewriting technique that simplifies SHACL validation in the presence of ontologies. The complexity of SHACL validation with ontologies is studied, revealing that even simple ontologies can make the problem EXPTIME-complete and PTIME-complete in data complexity. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: SHACL and OWL are two prominent W3C standards for managing RDF data. These languages share many features, but they have one fundamental difference: OWL, designed for inferring facts from incomplete data, makes the open-world assumption, whereas SHACL is a constraint language that treats the data as complete and must be validated under the closed-world assumption. The combination of both formalisms is very appealing and has been called for, but their semantic gap is a major challenge, semantically and computationally. In this paper, we advocate a semantics for SHACL validation in the presence of ontologies based on core universal models. We provide a technique for constructing these models for ontologies in the rich data-tractable description logic Horn-ALCHIQ. Furthermore, we use a finite representation of this model to develop a rewriting technique that reduces SHACL validation in the presence of ontologies to standard validation. Finally, we study the complexity of SHACL validation in the presence of ontologies, and show that even very simple ontologies make the problem EXPTIME-complete, and PTIME-complete in data complexity.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, molecular property prediction, reinforcement learning, attribute-based structured output, interpretability <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces AttriLens-Mol, a reinforcement learning framework for molecular property prediction with Large Language Models (LLMs). It steers the model's reasoning using attribute-based rewards and advanced techniques to improve relevance and performance. By training models on a small dataset with AttriLens-Mol, significant performance boosts are achieved compared to other fine-tuning and advanced models. Additionally, using the extracted attributes for property prediction results in superior performance compared to prompting LLMs. This approach enhances interpretability, making predictions more effective and relevant for molecular properties. The code is available on GitHub for further exploration and research. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in assisting molecular property prediction tasks but often rely on human-crafted prompts and chain-of-thought templates. While recent advanced large reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 employ reinforcement learning for an extended ``thinking'' process, their reasoning can be verbose and lack relevance. We introduce AttriLens-Mol, an attribute-guided reinforcement learning framework for molecular property prediction with LLMs. AttriLens-Mol steers the model's reasoning by using: (1) a format reward encouraging attribute-based structured output, (2) a count reward to avoid enumerating irrelevant attributes, and (3) a rationality reward using advanced LLMs and RDKit to verify the relatedness of the generated attributes. This approach implicitly elicits the model's inherent knowledge of relevant molecular attributes during reasoning, enables making predictions for the molecular property more effectively. Experiments on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets show that, training both 7B-size R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5 and R1-Distilled-LLaMA3.1 models on 4,000 samples with our proposed AttriLens-Mol method significantly boosts the performance, getting comparable or better results than supervised fine-tuning models (Mol-Instructions, ChemDFM, etc.) and advanced models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1, etc.). Further, our extracted attributes for the target property, when used as features for an interpretable decision tree model, yield superior performance compared to attributes generated by prompting LLMs. This shows that AttriLens-Mol effectively elicits more relevant and predictive molecular attributes, leading to enhanced interpretability and performance for property prediction. We release the code in https://github.com/szu-tera/AttriLens-Mol.

Summary:
This article introduces the concept of using large language models (LLMs) to provide constructive criticism for improving data visualizations. Visualisation makeovers, typically a community exercise, can now be emulated by LLMs. By priming the model with visualization best practices, users can receive feedback on their plots to enhance their effectiveness. The system focuses on educating users on improving existing visualizations rather than generating new ones. Evaluations demonstrate the LLM's sensitivity to various plotting issues across different chart types. The tool is accessible through a simple self-hosted applet with a user-friendly web interface. <div>

Abstract: Making a good graphic that accurately and efficiently conveys the desired message to the audience is both an art and a science, typically not taught in the data science curriculum. Visualisation makeovers are exercises where the community exchange feedback to improve charts and data visualizations. Can multi-modal large language models (LLMs) emulate this task? Given a plot in the form of an image file, or the code used to generate it, an LLM, primed with a list of visualization best practices, is employed to semi-automatically generate constructive criticism to produce a better plot. Our system is centred around prompt engineering of a pre-trained model, relying on a combination of userspecified guidelines and any latent knowledge of data visualization practices that might lie within an LLMs training corpus. Unlike other works, the focus is not on generating valid visualization scripts from raw data or prompts, but on educating the user how to improve their existing data visualizations according to an interpretation of best practices. A quantitative evaluation is performed to measure the sensitivity of the LLM agent to various plotting issues across different chart types. We make the tool available as a simple self-hosted applet with an accessible Web interface.

<div> deep learning, recommendation models, training efficiency, storage efficiency, model quality

Summary:<br />
- Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) are widely used in large-scale recommendation systems, requiring efficient storage and training algorithms due to the large amount of data involved.
- The Request-Only Optimizations (ROO) paradigm improves both storage and training efficiency as well as model quality by treating a user request as a unit of training data.
- ROO implementation involves using request-only data, request-only based data processing pipeline, and request-only neural architectures.
- Native feature deduplication in data logging is achieved by treating a user request as a unit, saving data storage.
- De-duplicating computations and communications across multiple impressions in a request allows for highly scaled-up neural network architectures, enabling better capturing of user interest signals. <div>
arXiv:2508.05640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) represent one of the largest machine learning applications on the planet. Industry-scale DLRMs are trained with petabytes of recommendation data to serve billions of users every day. To utilize the rich user signals in the long user history, DLRMs have been scaled up to unprecedented complexity, up to trillions of floating-point operations (TFLOPs) per example. This scale, coupled with the huge amount of training data, necessitates new storage and training algorithms to efficiently improve the quality of these complex recommendation systems. In this paper, we present a Request-Only Optimizations (ROO) training and modeling paradigm. ROO simultaneously improves the storage and training efficiency as well as the model quality of recommendation systems. We holistically approach this challenge through co-designing data (i.e., request-only data), infrastructure (i.e., request-only based data processing pipeline), and model architecture (i.e., request-only neural architectures). Our ROO training and modeling paradigm treats a user request as a unit of the training data. Compared with the established practice of treating a user impression as a unit, our new design achieves native feature deduplication in data logging, consequently saving data storage. Second, by de-duplicating computations and communications across multiple impressions in a request, this new paradigm enables highly scaled-up neural network architectures to better capture user interest signals, such as Generative Recommenders (GRs) and other request-only friendly architectures.

Summary:
Research groups often struggle to capture, store, and retrieve distributed knowledge within their teams. This informal, experience-based expertise, known as tacit knowledge, is crucial but often left undocumented. AquiLLM is a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system designed to address this challenge. Unlike existing systems focused on public documents, AquiLLM is tailored for internal research materials, such as emails and meeting notes, with configurable privacy settings. By supporting various document types and privacy settings, AquiLLM enables more effective access to both formal and informal knowledge within scholarly groups. <div>

Abstract: Research groups face persistent challenges in capturing, storing, and retrieving knowledge that is distributed across team members. Although structured data intended for analysis and publication is often well managed, much of a group's collective knowledge remains informal, fragmented, or undocumented--often passed down orally through meetings, mentoring, and day-to-day collaboration. This includes private resources such as emails, meeting notes, training materials, and ad hoc documentation. Together, these reflect the group's tacit knowledge--the informal, experience-based expertise that underlies much of their work. Accessing this knowledge can be difficult, requiring significant time and insider understanding. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems offer promising solutions by enabling users to query and generate responses grounded in relevant source material. However, most current RAG-LLM systems are oriented toward public documents and overlook the privacy concerns of internal research materials. We introduce AquiLLM (pronounced ah-quill-em), a lightweight, modular RAG system designed to meet the needs of research groups. AquiLLM supports varied document types and configurable privacy settings, enabling more effective access to both formal and informal knowledge within scholarly groups.

Abstract: While Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is now widely adopted to enhance LLMs, evaluating its true performance benefits in a reproducible and interpretable way remains a major hurdle. Existing methods often fall short: they lack domain coverage, employ coarse metrics that miss sub document precision, and fail to capture computational trade offs. Most critically, they provide no standardized framework for comparing RAG effectiveness across different models and domains.
  We introduce OmniBench RAG, a novel automated platform for multi domain evaluation of RAG systems. The platform quantifies performance gains across accuracy and efficiency dimensions, spanning nine knowledge fields including culture, geography, and health. We introduce two standardized metrics: Improvements (accuracy gains) and Transformation (efficiency differences between pre RAG and post RAG models), enabling reproducible comparisons across models and tasks. The platform features dynamic test generation, modular evaluation pipelines, and automated knowledge base construction. Our evaluation reveals striking variability in RAG effectiveness, from significant gains in culture to declines in mathematics, highlighting the critical importance of systematic, domain aware assessment.

Challenges arise in response to (1) how to provide accurate outdoor trail information via conversational AI; and (2) how to enable usable and efficient recommendation services. To address above, this paper discusses the preliminary and practical lessons learned from developing Judy, an outdoor trail recommendation chatbot based on the large language model (LLM) with retrieval augmented generation (RAG). To gain concrete system insights, we have performed case studies with the outdoor trails in Connecticut (CT), US. We have conducted web-based data collection, outdoor trail data management, and LLM model performance studies on the RAG-based recommendation. Our experimental results have demonstrated the accuracy, effectiveness, and usability of Judy in recommending outdoor trails based on the LLM with RAG.

Abstract: Institutions dependent on IT services and resources acknowledge the crucial significance of an IT help desk system, that act as a centralized hub connecting IT staff and users for service requests. Employing various Machine Learning models, these IT help desk systems allow access to corrective actions used in the past, but each model has different performance when applied to different datasets. This work compares eleven Information Retrieval techniques in a dataset of IT support tickets, with the goal of implementing a software that facilitates the work of Information Technology support analysts. The best results were obtained with the Sentence-BERT technique, in its multi-language variation distilluse-base-multilingual-cased-v1, where 78.7% of the recommendations made by the model were considered relevant. TF-IDF (69.0%), Word2vec (68.7%) and LDA (66.3%) techniques also had consistent results. Furthermore, the used datasets and essential parts of coding have been published and made open source. It also demonstrated the practicality of a support ticket recovery system by implementing a minimal viable prototype, and described in detail the implementation of the system. Finally, this work proposed a novel metric for comparing the techniques, whose aim is to closely reflect the perception of the IT analysts about the retrieval quality.

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) enhance recommendation quality by engaging users in multi-turn dialogues, capturing nuanced preferences through natural language interactions. However, these systems often face the false negative issue, where items that a user might like are incorrectly labeled as negative during training, leading to suboptimal recommendations.Expanding the label set through data augmentation presents an intuitive solution but faces the challenge of balancing two key aspects: ensuring semantic relevance and preserving the collaborative information inherent in CRS datasets. To address these issues, we propose a novel data augmentation framework that first leverages an LLM-based semantic retriever to identify diverse and semantically relevant items, which are then filtered by a relevance scorer to remove noisy candidates. Building on this, we introduce a two-stage training strategy balancing semantic relevance and collaborative information. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets and user simulators demonstrate significant and consistent performance improvements across various recommenders, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach in advancing CRS performance.

Abstract: The surge in scientific publications challenges traditional review methods, demanding tools that integrate structured metadata with full-text analysis. Hybrid Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, combining graph queries with vector search offer promise but are typically static, rely on proprietary tools, and lack uncertainty estimates. We present an agentic approach that encapsulates the hybrid RAG pipeline within an autonomous agent capable of (1) dynamically selecting between GraphRAG and VectorRAG for each query, (2) adapting instruction-tuned generation in real time to researcher needs, and (3) quantifying uncertainty during inference. This dynamic orchestration improves relevance, reduces hallucinations, and promotes reproducibility.
  Our pipeline ingests bibliometric open-access data from PubMed, arXiv, and Google Scholar APIs, builds a Neo4j citation-based knowledge graph (KG), and embeds full-text PDFs into a FAISS vector store (VS) using the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model. A Llama-3.3-70B agent selects GraphRAG (translating queries to Cypher for KG) or VectorRAG (combining sparse and dense retrieval with re-ranking). Instruction tuning refines domain-specific generation, and bootstrapped evaluation yields standard deviation for evaluation metrics.
  On synthetic benchmarks mimicking real-world queries, the Instruction-Tuned Agent with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) outperforms the baseline, achieving a gain of 0.63 in VS Context Recall and a 0.56 gain in overall Context Precision. Additional gains include 0.24 in VS Faithfulness, 0.12 in both VS Precision and KG Answer Relevance, 0.11 in overall Faithfulness score, 0.05 in KG Context Recall, and 0.04 in both VS Answer Relevance and overall Precision. These results highlight the system's improved reasoning over heterogeneous sources and establish a scalable framework for autonomous, agentic scientific discovery.

Abstract: Visual search offers an intuitive way for customers to explore diverse product catalogs, particularly in consumer-to-consumer (C2C) marketplaces where listings are often unstructured and visually driven. This paper presents a scalable visual search system deployed in Mercari's C2C marketplace, where end-users act as buyers and sellers. We evaluate recent vision-language models for zero-shot image retrieval and compare their performance with an existing fine-tuned baseline. The system integrates real-time inference and background indexing workflows, supported by a unified embedding pipeline optimized through dimensionality reduction. Offline evaluation using user interaction logs shows that the multilingual SigLIP model outperforms other models across multiple retrieval metrics, achieving a 13.3% increase in nDCG@5 over the baseline. A one-week online A/B test in production further confirms real-world impact, with the treatment group showing substantial gains in engagement and conversion, up to a 40.9% increase in transaction rate via image search. Our findings highlight that recent zero-shot models can serve as a strong and practical baseline for production use, which enables teams to deploy effective visual search systems with minimal overhead, while retaining the flexibility to fine-tune based on future data or domain-specific needs.

Summary: 
The article presents Streaming RAG, a unified pipeline that utilizes multi-vector cosine screening, mini-batch clustering, and a counter-based heavy-hitter filter to manage dynamic streams efficiently. It addresses the challenges posed by static RAG frameworks, such as high memory costs and latency issues. The system maintains a compact prototype set and achieves a balance between retrieval quality and clustering variance. An incremental index upsert mechanism ensures prototypes are updated without interrupting queries. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in recall, low latency, and high throughput within a specified memory budget. Hyperparameter analysis validates default settings, while application in open-domain question answering and summarization tasks shows performance enhancements. Streaming RAG sets a new standard for retrieval augmentation, offering a versatile solution for handling dynamic data streams effectively. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Dynamic streams from news feeds, social media, sensor networks, and financial markets challenge static RAG frameworks. Full-scale indices incur high memory costs; periodic rebuilds introduce latency that undermines data freshness; naive sampling sacrifices semantic coverage. We present Streaming RAG, a unified pipeline that combines multi-vector cosine screening, mini-batch clustering, and a counter-based heavy-hitter filter to maintain a compact prototype set. We further prove an approximation bound \$E\[R(K\_t)] \ge R^\* - L \Delta\$ linking retrieval quality to clustering variance. An incremental index upsert mechanism refreshes prototypes without interrupting queries. Experiments on eight real-time streams show statistically significant gains in Recall\@10 (up to 3 points, p < 0.01), end-to-end latency below 15 ms, and throughput above 900 documents per second under a 150 MB budget. Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis over cluster count, admission probability, relevance threshold, and counter capacity validates default settings. In open-domain question answering with GPT-3.5 Turbo, we record 3.2-point gain in Exact Match and 2.8-point gain in F1 on SQuAD; abstractive summarization yields ROUGE-L improvements. Streaming RAG establishes a new Pareto frontier for retrieval augmentation.

Summary:<br /><br /> This case study explores various techniques for enhancing AI customer service systems in the electric power domain. It compares vector-store and graph-based frameworks, with the graph-based RAG showing superior performance in handling complex queries. Query rewriting improves retrieval for non-standard or detail-specific queries, while RAG Fusion merges multiple retrievals to address vague or multifaceted queries. Context reranking filters irrelevant contexts to reduce hallucinations, and intent recognition supports decomposing complex questions into targeted sub-queries for increased relevance and efficiency. Although keyword augmentation had a negative impact due to biased keyword selection, the final system combines intent recognition, RAG Fusion, and reranking to effectively handle disambiguation and multi-source queries. Evaluation on both synthetic and real-world datasets showcases the system's high accuracy, outperforming baseline RAG models significantly.<br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Many AI customer service systems use standard NLP pipelines or finetuned language models, which often fall short on ambiguous, multi-intent, or detail-specific queries. This case study evaluates recent techniques: query rewriting, RAG Fusion, keyword augmentation, intent recognition, and context reranking, for building a robust customer support system in the electric power domain. We compare vector-store and graph-based RAG frameworks, ultimately selecting the graph-based RAG for its superior performance in handling complex queries. We find that query rewriting improves retrieval for queries using non-standard terminology or requiring precise detail. RAG Fusion boosts performance on vague or multifaceted queries by merging multiple retrievals. Reranking reduces hallucinations by filtering irrelevant contexts. Intent recognition supports the decomposition of complex questions into more targeted sub-queries, increasing both relevance and efficiency. In contrast, keyword augmentation negatively impacts results due to biased keyword selection. Our final system combines intent recognition, RAG Fusion, and reranking to handle disambiguation and multi-source queries. Evaluated on both a GPT-4-generated dataset and a real-world electricity provider FAQ dataset, it achieves 97.9% and 89.6% accuracy respectively, substantially outperforming baseline RAG models.

Abstract: We present HySemRAG, a framework that combines Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipelines with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to automate large-scale literature synthesis and identify methodological research gaps. The system addresses limitations in existing RAG architectures through a multi-layered approach: hybrid retrieval combining semantic search, keyword filtering, and knowledge graph traversal; an agentic self-correction framework with iterative quality assurance; and post-hoc citation verification ensuring complete traceability. Our implementation processes scholarly literature through eight integrated stages: multi-source metadata acquisition, asynchronous PDF retrieval, custom document layout analysis using modified Docling architecture, bibliographic management, LLM-based field extraction, topic modeling, semantic unification, and knowledge graph construction. The system creates dual data products - a Neo4j knowledge graph enabling complex relationship queries and Qdrant vector collections supporting semantic search - serving as foundational infrastructure for verifiable information synthesis. Evaluation across 643 observations from 60 testing sessions demonstrates structured field extraction achieving 35.1% higher semantic similarity scores (0.655 $\pm$ 0.178) compared to PDF chunking approaches (0.485 $\pm$ 0.204, p < 0.000001). The agentic quality assurance mechanism achieves 68.3% single-pass success rates with 99.0% citation accuracy in validated responses. Applied to geospatial epidemiology literature on ozone exposure and cardiovascular disease, the system identifies methodological trends and research gaps, demonstrating broad applicability across scientific domains for accelerating evidence synthesis and discovery.

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) have shown great performance in natural language tasks but struggle in recommendation systems due to differences in data structure. To address this, a new instruction tuning dataset, ITDR, was created, with 7 subtasks covering user-item interaction and understanding. Data from 13 public recommendation datasets was integrated into ITDR, comprising around 200,000 instances. Experimental results indicate that ITDR significantly enhances the performance of mainstream LLMs on recommendation tasks. The correlations between tasks were analyzed, and the impact of task descriptions and data scale on instruction tuning effectiveness was explored. Comparative experiments with closed-source LLMs were also conducted. The ITDR dataset and fine-tuned large recommendation models can be accessed on GitHub.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in natural language processing tasks. However, in the field of recommendation systems, due to the structural differences between user behavior data and natural language, LLMs struggle to effectively model the associations between user preferences and items. Although prompt-based methods can generate recommendation results, their inadequate understanding of recommendation tasks leads to constrained performance. To address this gap, in this work, we construct a sufficient instruction tuning dataset, ITDR, which encompasses 7 subtasks across two core root tasks--user-item interaction and user-item understanding. The dataset integrates data from 13 public recommendation datasets and is built using manually crafted standardized templates, comprising approximately 200,000 instances. Experimental results demonstrate that ITDR significantly enhances the performance of mainstream open-source LLMs such as GLM-4, Qwen2.5, Qwen2.5-Instruct and LLaMA-3.2 on recommendation tasks. Furthermore, we analyze the correlations between tasks and explore the impact of task descriptions and data scale on instruction tuning effectiveness. Finally, we perform comparative experiments against closed-source LLMs with substantial parameters. Our tuning dataset ITDR and the fine-tuned large recommendation models can be accessed at https://github.com/hellolzk/ITDR.

Abstract: Accurately extracting and representing the structure of tabular data from financial documents remains a critical challenge in document understanding, particularly for regulatory and analytical use cases. This study addresses the complexity of converting financial tables from Malaysian audited financial reports into Markdown format, a task complicated by rotated layouts, multi-level headers, and implicit structural cues. We propose a fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM), based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, optimized for high-fidelity Markdown generation from document images. Our approach includes a curated dataset of 2,152 image-text pairs with augmentations and a supervised fine-tuning strategy using LoRA. To assess performance, we evaluated our model on 100 out-of-sample tables using a dual framework: a criteria-based LLM-as-a-judge for fine-grained accuracy and our novel Markdown Tree-Edit-Distance-based Similarity (TEDS) metric for holistic structural fidelity. Our model achieves a 92.20% overall accuracy on the criteria-based assessment and a 96.53% Markdown TEDS score. This performance significantly surpasses its Qwen2.5-VL-7B base model, larger-scale VLMs, and specialized reasoning-enabled models. Compared to these self-hosted alternatives, it also significantly reduces inference time. Furthermore, its accuracy exceeds that of widely used proprietary models such as OpenAI's GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Flash. These results demonstrate that domain-specific fine-tuning provides an effective and efficient method to bridge the gap between unstructured financial documents and downstream automation, rivalling much larger and more general models without their computational overhead.

- Four state-of-the-art LLMs are tested in two scenarios, one-shot zero-sum game and dynamic Prisoner's Dilemma, across five languages to assess linguistic sensitivity.
- The final payoffs in the games are influenced by agent characteristics like personality traits and knowledge of repeated rounds.
- Unexpected sensitivity in payoffs is observed based on the choice of languages, emphasizing the need for caution in deploying LLMs in different regions.
- Quantitative metrics are utilized to evaluate internal consistency and cross-language stability of LLM agents, aiding in selecting stable LLMs for secure applications.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Game theory has long served as a foundational tool in cybersecurity to test, predict, and design strategic interactions between attackers and defenders. The recent advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers new tools and challenges for the security of computer systems; In this work, we investigate whether classical game-theoretic frameworks can effectively capture the behaviours of LLM-driven actors and bots. Using a reproducible framework for game-theoretic LLM agents, we investigate two canonical scenarios -- the one-shot zero-sum game and the dynamic Prisoner's Dilemma -- and we test whether LLMs converge to expected outcomes or exhibit deviations due to embedded biases. Our experiments involve four state-of-the-art LLMs and span five natural languages, English, French, Arabic, Vietnamese, and Mandarin Chinese, to assess linguistic sensitivity. For both games, we observe that the final payoffs are influenced by agents characteristics such as personality traits or knowledge of repeated rounds. Moreover, we uncover an unexpected sensitivity of the final payoffs to the choice of languages, which should warn against indiscriminate application of LLMs in cybersecurity applications and call for in-depth studies, as LLMs may behave differently when deployed in different countries. We also employ quantitative metrics to evaluate the internal consistency and cross-language stability of LLM agents, to help guide the selection of the most stable LLMs and optimising models for secure applications.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often struggle with domain-specific knowledge due to performance deterioration of pre-trained embeddings and prohibitive computational costs of large language model (LLM)-based retrievers. While fine-tuning data augmentation embedding models offers a promising direction, its effectiveness is limited by the need for high-quality training data and reliable chunking strategies that preserve contextual integrity. We propose LMAR (Language Model Augmented Retriever), a model-agnostic framework that addresses these challenges by combining LLM-guided data synthesis with contrastive embedding adaptation and efficient text clustering. LMAR consists of a two-stage pipeline: (1) Triplet sampling and synthetic data augmentation, where LLMs act as both labeler and validator to ensure high-fidelity supervision throughout the pipeline. Experimental results across multiple domain-specific benchmark datasets demonstrate that LMAR outperforms multiple baseline models, while maintaining moderate hardware requirements and low latency. Its model-agnostic nature further enables seamless integration with emerging RAG architectures and text embedding models, ensuring continual improvements without redesigning the pipeline. These results highlight LMAR as a practical and cost-effective solution for scalable domain-specific adaptation.

arXiv:2508.05673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of recommender systems (RS), Top-$K$ ranking metrics such as NDCG@$K$ are the gold standard for evaluating recommendation performance. However, during the training of recommendation models, optimizing NDCG@$K$ poses significant challenges due to its inherent discontinuous nature and the intricate Top-$K$ truncation. Recent efforts to optimize NDCG@$K$ have either overlooked the Top-$K$ truncation or suffered from high computational costs and training instability. To overcome these limitations, we propose SoftmaxLoss@$K$ (SL@$K$), a novel recommendation loss tailored for NDCG@$K$ optimization. Specifically, we integrate the quantile technique to handle Top-$K$ truncation and derive a smooth upper bound for optimizing NDCG@$K$ to address discontinuity. The resulting SL@$K$ loss has several desirable properties, including theoretical guarantees, ease of implementation, computational efficiency, gradient stability, and noise robustness. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets and three recommendation backbones demonstrate that SL@$K$ outperforms existing losses with a notable average improvement of 6.03%.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM agentic systems have improved the automation of offensive security tasks, particularly for Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges. We systematically investigate the key factors that drive agent success and provide a detailed recipe for building effective LLM-based offensive security agents. First, we present CTFJudge, a framework leveraging LLM as a judge to analyze agent trajectories and provide granular evaluation across CTF solving steps. Second, we propose a novel metric, CTF Competency Index (CCI) for partial correctness, revealing how closely agent solutions align with human-crafted gold standards. Third, we examine how LLM hyperparameters, namely temperature, top-p, and maximum token length, influence agent performance and automated cybersecurity task planning. For rapid evaluation, we present CTFTiny, a curated benchmark of 50 representative CTF challenges across binary exploitation, web, reverse engineering, forensics, and cryptography. Our findings identify optimal multi-agent coordination settings and lay the groundwork for future LLM agent research in cybersecurity. We make CTFTiny open source to public https://github.com/NYU-LLM-CTF/CTFTiny along with CTFJudge on https://github.com/NYU-LLM-CTF/CTFJudge.

arXiv:2508.05675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed growing interest in adopting large language models (LLMs) for Register Transfer Level (RTL) code optimization. While powerful cloud-based LLMs offer superior optimization capabilities, they pose unacceptable intellectual property (IP) leakage risks when processing proprietary hardware designs. In this paper, we propose a new scenario where Verilog code must be optimized for specific attributes without leaking sensitive IP information. We introduce the first IP-preserving edge-cloud collaborative framework that leverages the benefits of both paradigms. Our approach employs local small LLMs (e.g., Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B) to perform secure comparative analysis between paired high-quality target designs and novice draft codes, yielding general design principles that summarize key insights for improvements. These principles are then used to query stronger cloud LLMs (e.g., Deepseek-V3) for targeted code improvement, ensuring that only abstracted and IP-safe guidance reaches external services. Our experimental results demonstrate that the framework achieves significantly higher optimization success rates compared to baseline methods. For example, combining Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B and Deepseek-V3 achieves a 66.67\% optimization success rate for power utilization, outperforming Deepseek-V3 alone (49.81\%) and even commercial models like GPT-4o (55.81\%). Further investigation of local and cloud LLM combinations reveals that different model pairings exhibit varying strengths for specific optimization objectives, with interesting trends emerging when varying the number of comparative code pairs. Our work establishes a new paradigm for secure hardware design optimization that balances performance gains with IP protection.

Abstract: RL-based medical questionnaire systems have shown great potential in medical scenarios. However, their safety and robustness remain unresolved. This study performs a comprehensive evaluation on adversarial attack methods to identify and analyze their potential vulnerabilities. We formulate the diagnosis process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), where the state is the patient responses and unasked questions, and the action is either to ask a question or to make a diagnosis. We implemented six prevailing major attack methods, including the Fast Gradient Signed Method (FGSM), Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), Carlini & Wagner Attack (C&amp;W) attack, Basic Iterative Method (BIM), DeepFool, and AutoAttack, with seven epsilon values each. To ensure the generated adversarial examples remain clinically plausible, we developed a comprehensive medical validation framework consisting of 247 medical constraints, including physiological bounds, symptom correlations, and conditional medical constraints. We achieved a 97.6% success rate in generating clinically plausible adversarial samples. We performed our experiment on the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) dataset (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/), which consists of 182,630 samples, to predict the participant's 4-year mortality rate. We evaluated our attacks on the AdaptiveFS framework proposed in arXiv:2004.00994. Our results show that adversarial attacks could significantly impact the diagnostic accuracy, with attack success rates ranging from 33.08% (FGSM) to 64.70% (AutoAttack). Our work has demonstrated that even under strict medical constraints on the input, such RL-based medical questionnaire systems still show significant vulnerabilities.

<title>Are All Genders Equal in the Eyes of Algorithms? -- Analysing Search and Retrieval Algorithms for Algorithmic Gender Fairness</title>

Abstract: Algorithmic systems such as search engines and information retrieval platforms significantly influence academic visibility and the dissemination of knowledge. Despite assumptions of neutrality, these systems can reproduce or reinforce societal biases, including those related to gender. This paper introduces and applies a bias-preserving definition of algorithmic gender fairness, which assesses whether algorithmic outputs reflect real-world gender distributions without introducing or amplifying disparities. Using a heterogeneous dataset of academic profiles from German universities and universities of applied sciences, we analyse gender differences in metadata completeness, publication retrieval in academic databases, and visibility in Google search results. While we observe no overt algorithmic discrimination, our findings reveal subtle but consistent imbalances: male professors are associated with a greater number of search results and more aligned publication records, while female professors display higher variability in digital visibility. These patterns reflect the interplay between platform algorithms, institutional curation, and individual self-presentation. Our study highlights the need for fairness evaluations that account for both technical performance and representational equality in digital systems.

<title>Selection-Based Vulnerabilities: Clean-Label Backdoor Attacks in Active Learning</title>

Abstract: Active learning(AL), which serves as the representative label-efficient learning paradigm, has been widely applied in resource-constrained scenarios. The achievement of AL is attributed to acquisition functions, which are designed for identifying the most important data to label. Despite this success, one question remains unanswered: is AL safe? In this work, we introduce ALA, a practical and the first framework to utilize the acquisition function as the poisoning attack surface to reveal the weakness of active learning. Specifically, ALA optimizes imperceptibly poisoned inputs to exhibit high uncertainty scores, increasing their probability of being selected by acquisition functions. To evaluate ALA, we conduct extensive experiments across three datasets, three acquisition functions, and two types of clean-label backdoor triggers. Results show that our attack can achieve high success rates (up to 94%) even under low poisoning budgets (0.5%-1.0%) while preserving model utility and remaining undetectable to human annotators. Our findings remind active learning users: acquisition functions can be easily exploited, and active learning should be deployed with caution in trusted data scenarios.

<title>Risk Analysis Techniques for Governed LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems</title>

Abstract: Organisations are starting to adopt LLM-based AI agents, with their deployments naturally evolving from single agents towards interconnected, multi-agent networks. Yet a collection of safe agents does not guarantee a safe collection of agents, as interactions between agents over time create emergent behaviours and induce novel failure modes. This means multi-agent systems require a fundamentally different risk analysis approach than that used for a single agent.
  This report addresses the early stages of risk identification and analysis for multi-agent AI systems operating within governed environments where organisations control their agent configurations and deployment. In this setting, we examine six critical failure modes: cascading reliability failures, inter-agent communication failures, monoculture collapse, conformity bias, deficient theory of mind, and mixed motive dynamics. For each, we provide a toolkit for practitioners to extend or integrate into their existing frameworks to assess these failure modes within their organisational contexts.
  Given fundamental limitations in current LLM behavioural understanding, our approach centres on analysis validity, and advocates for progressively increasing validity through staged testing across stages of abstraction and deployment that gradually increases exposure to potential negative impacts, while collecting convergent evidence through simulation, observational analysis, benchmarking, and red teaming. This methodology establishes the groundwork for robust organisational risk management as these LLM-based multi-agent systems are deployed and operated.

Abstract: Selecting third-party software packages in open-source ecosystems like Python is challenging due to the large number of alternatives and limited transparent evidence for comparison. Generative AI tools are increasingly used in development workflows, but their suggestions often overlook dependency evaluation, emphasize popularity over suitability, and lack reproducibility. This creates risks for projects that require transparency, long-term reliability, maintainability, and informed architectural decisions. This study formulates software package selection as a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) problem and proposes a data-driven framework for technology evaluation. Automated data pipelines continuously collect and integrate software metadata, usage trends, vulnerability information, and developer sentiment from GitHub, PyPI, and Stack Overflow. These data are structured into a decision model representing relationships among packages, domain features, and quality attributes. The framework is implemented in PySelect, a decision support system that uses large language models to interpret user intent and query the model to identify contextually appropriate packages. The approach is evaluated using 798,669 Python scripts from 16,887 GitHub repositories and a user study based on the Technology Acceptance Model. Results show high data extraction precision, improved recommendation quality over generative AI baselines, and positive user evaluations of usefulness and ease of use. This work introduces a scalable, interpretable, and reproducible framework that supports evidence-based software selection using MCDM principles, empirical data, and AI-assisted intent modeling.

<title>DMFI: Dual-Modality Fine-Tuning and Inference Framework for LLM-Based Insider Threat Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05694</link>

Abstract: Insider threat detection (ITD) poses a persistent and high-impact challenge in cybersecurity due to the subtle, long-term, and context-dependent nature of malicious insider behaviors. Traditional models often struggle to capture semantic intent and complex behavior dynamics, while existing LLM-based solutions face limitations in prompt adaptability and modality coverage. To bridge this gap, we propose DMFI, a dual-modality framework that integrates semantic inference with behavior-aware fine-tuning. DMFI converts raw logs into two structured views: (1) a semantic view that processes content-rich artifacts (e.g., emails, https) using instruction-formatted prompts; and (2) a behavioral abstraction, constructed via a 4W-guided (When-Where-What-Which) transformation to encode contextual action sequences. Two LoRA-enhanced LLMs are fine-tuned independently, and their outputs are fused via a lightweight MLP-based decision module. We further introduce DMFI-B, a discriminative adaptation strategy that separates normal and abnormal behavior representations, improving robustness under severe class imbalance. Experiments on CERT r4.2 and r5.2 datasets demonstrate that DMFI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy. Our approach combines the semantic reasoning power of LLMs with structured behavior modeling, offering a scalable and effective solution for real-world insider threat detection. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining LLM reasoning with structured behavioral modeling, offering a scalable and deployable solution for modern insider threat detection.

Abstract: Insider threat detection presents a significant challenge due to the deceptive nature of malicious behaviors, which often resemble legitimate user operations. However, existing approaches typically model system logs as flat event sequences, thereby failing to capture the inherent frequency dynamics and multiscale disturbance patterns embedded in user behavior. To address these limitations, we propose Log2Sig, a robust anomaly detection framework that transforms user logs into multivariate behavioral frequency signals, introducing a novel representation of user behavior. Log2Sig employs Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition (MVMD) to extract Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs), which reveal behavioral fluctuations across multiple temporal scales. Based on this, the model further performs joint modeling of behavioral sequences and frequency-decomposed signals: the daily behavior sequences are encoded using a Mamba-based temporal encoder to capture long-term dependencies, while the corresponding frequency components are linearly projected to match the encoder's output dimension. These dual-view representations are then fused to construct a comprehensive user behavior profile, which is fed into a multilayer perceptron for precise anomaly detection. Experimental results on the CERT r4.2 and r5.2 datasets demonstrate that Log2Sig significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and F1 score.

Abstract: Large embedding tables are indispensable in modern recommendation systems, thanks to their ability to effectively capture and memorize intricate details of interactions among diverse entities. As we explore integrating large embedding tables into Pinterest's ads ranking models, we encountered not only common challenges such as sparsity and scalability, but also several obstacles unique to our context. Notably, our initial attempts to train large embedding tables from scratch resulted in neutral metrics. To tackle this, we introduced a novel multi-faceted pretraining scheme that incorporates multiple pretraining algorithms. This approach greatly enriched the embedding tables and resulted in significant performance improvements. As a result, the multi-faceted large embedding tables bring great performance gain on both the Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR) domains. Moreover, we designed a CPU-GPU hybrid serving infrastructure to overcome GPU memory limits and elevate the scalability. This framework has been deployed in the Pinterest Ads system and achieved 1.34% online CPC reduction and 2.60% CTR increase with neutral end-to-end latency change.

<title>Semantic Reasoning Meets Numerical Precision: An LLM-Powered Multi-Agent System for Power Grid Control</title>

Abstract: The increasing penetration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), widespread adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs), and the growing frequency of extreme weather events have significantly increased the complexity of power grid planning, operation, and management. Traditional rule-based systems and numerical optimization approaches often struggle with the scale, dynamics, and adaptability required by modern power networks. This paper introduces Grid-Agent, an autonomous, AI-driven framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with multi-agent reinforcement learning to detect and remediate grid violations in real time. Grid-Agent integrates semantic reasoning with numerical precision through a modular agent architecture: a planning agent generates coordinated action sequences using numerical power flow solvers, while a validation agent evaluates system stability and action effectiveness via sandboxed execution with safety rollbacks. To ensure scalability, Grid-Agent incorporates an adaptive multiscale network representation that dynamically selects optimal encoding schemes based on network size and complexity. The framework enables coordinated violation resolution through optimizing switch configurations, battery deployment, and load curtailment strategies. Experimental results in standard IEEE and CIGRE test systems (IEEE 69-bus, CIGRE MV, and IEEE 30-bus) demonstrate superior violation mitigation performance. Additionally, the framework's built-in data collection and learning capabilities enable continuous learning and adaptation to diverse network topologies. The autonomous nature of the framework makes it particularly suitable for modern smart grid applications requiring rapid response to dynamic operating conditions.

<title>A Physiologically-Constrained Neural Network Digital Twin Framework for Replicating Glucose Dynamics in Type 1 Diabetes</title>

Abstract: Simulating glucose dynamics in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) is critical for developing personalized treatments and supporting data-driven clinical decisions. Existing models often miss key physiological aspects and are difficult to individualize. Here, we introduce physiologically-constrained neural network (NN) digital twins to simulate glucose dynamics in T1D. To ensure interpretability and physiological consistency, we first build a population-level NN state-space model aligned with a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describing glucose regulation. This model is formally verified to conform to known T1D dynamics. Digital twins are then created by augmenting the population model with individual-specific models, which include personal data, such as glucose management and contextual information, capturing both inter- and intra-individual variability. We validate our approach using real-world data from the T1D Exercise Initiative study. Two weeks of data per participant were split into 5-hour sequences and simulated glucose profiles were compared to observed ones. Clinically relevant outcomes were used to assess similarity via paired equivalence t-tests with predefined clinical equivalence margins. Across 394 digital twins, glucose outcomes were equivalent between simulated and observed data: time in range (70-180 mg/dL) was 75.1$\pm$21.2% (simulated) vs. 74.4$\pm$15.4% (real; P<0.001); time below range (<70 mg/dL) 2.5$\pm$5.2% vs. 3.0$\pm$3.3% (P=0.022); and time above range (>180 mg/dL) 22.4$\pm$22.0% vs. 22.6$\pm$15.9% (P<0.001). Our framework can incorporate unmodeled factors like sleep and activity while preserving key dynamics. This approach enables personalized in silico testing of treatments, supports insulin optimization, and integrates physics-based and data-driven modeling.

Abstract: Precise, correct feedback is crucial for effectively training large language models (LLMs) in code reinforcement learning. However, synthesizing high-quality test cases remains a profoundly challenging and unsolved problem. In this work, we present Klear-CodeTest, a comprehensive test case synthesis framework featuring rigorous verification to ensure quality and reliability of test cases. Our approach achieves broad coverage of programming problems via a novel Generator-Validation (G-V) framework, ensuring correctness through a consistency validation mechanism that verifies outputs against gold solutions. The proposed G-V framework generates comprehensive test cases including both regular and corner cases, enhancing test coverage and discriminative power for solution correctness assessment in code reinforcement learning. In addition, we design a multi-layered security sandbox system optimized for online verification platforms, guaranteeing safe and reliable code execution. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our curated dataset, showing significant improvements in model performance and training stability.

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have heightened concerns about their potential misuse, especially in generating harmful or misleading content. This underscores the urgent need for effective machine unlearning, i.e., removing specific knowledge or concepts from pretrained models without compromising overall performance. One possible approach is Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which offers an efficient means to fine-tune models for targeted unlearning. However, LoRA often inadvertently alters unrelated content, leading to diminished image fidelity and realism. To address this limitation, we introduce UnGuide -- a novel approach which incorporates UnGuidance, a dynamic inference mechanism that leverages Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) to exert precise control over the unlearning process. UnGuide modulates the guidance scale based on the stability of a few first steps of denoising processes, enabling selective unlearning by LoRA adapter. For prompts containing the erased concept, the LoRA module predominates and is counterbalanced by the base model; for unrelated prompts, the base model governs generation, preserving content fidelity. Empirical results demonstrate that UnGuide achieves controlled concept removal and retains the expressive power of diffusion models, outperforming existing LoRA-based methods in both object erasure and explicit content removal tasks.

Abstract: Machine learning using transformers has shown great potential in medical imaging, but its real-world applicability remains limited due to the scarcity of annotated data. In this study, we propose a practical framework for the few-shot deployment of pretrained MRI transformers in diverse brain imaging tasks. By utilizing the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pretraining strategy on a large-scale, multi-cohort brain MRI dataset comprising over 31 million slices, we obtain highly transferable latent representations that generalize well across tasks and datasets. For high-level tasks such as classification, a frozen MAE encoder combined with a lightweight linear head achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in MRI sequence identification with minimal supervision. For low-level tasks such as segmentation, we propose MAE-FUnet, a hybrid architecture that fuses multiscale CNN features with pretrained MAE embeddings. This model consistently outperforms other strong baselines in both skull stripping and multi-class anatomical segmentation under data-limited conditions. With extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, our framework demonstrates efficiency, stability, and scalability, suggesting its suitability for low-resource clinical environments and broader neuroimaging applications.

<title>From Imperfect Signals to Trustworthy Structure: Confidence-Aware Inference from Heterogeneous and Reliability-Varying Utility Data</title>

Abstract: Accurate distribution grid topology is essential for reliable modern grid operations. However, real-world utility data originates from multiple sources with varying characteristics and levels of quality. In this work, developed in collaboration with Oncor Electric Delivery, we propose a scalable framework that reconstructs a trustworthy grid topology by systematically integrating heterogeneous data. We observe that distribution topology is fundamentally governed by two complementary dimensions: the spatial layout of physical infrastructure (e.g., GIS and asset metadata) and the dynamic behavior of the system in the signal domain (e.g., voltage time series). When jointly leveraged, these dimensions support a complete and physically coherent reconstruction of network connectivity. To address the challenge of uneven data quality without compromising observability, we introduce a confidence-aware inference mechanism that preserves structurally informative yet imperfect inputs, while quantifying the reliability of each inferred connection for operator interpretation. This soft handling of uncertainty is tightly coupled with hard enforcement of physical feasibility: we embed operational constraints, such as transformer capacity limits and radial topology requirements, directly into the learning process. Together, these components ensure that inference is both uncertainty-aware and structurally valid, enabling rapid convergence to actionable, trustworthy topologies under real-world deployment conditions. The proposed framework is validated using data from over 8000 meters across 3 feeders in Oncor's service territory, demonstrating over 95% accuracy in topology reconstruction and substantial improvements in confidence calibration and computational efficiency relative to baseline methods.

Abstract: Understanding large-scale, complex software systems is a major challenge for developers, who spend a significant portion of their time on program comprehension. Traditional tools such as static visualizations and reverse engineering techniques provide structural insights but often lack interactivity, adaptability, and integration with contextual information. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to enhance code exploration workflows, yet their lack of grounding and integration with structured views limits their effectiveness. This work introduces a hybrid approach that integrates deterministic reverse engineering with LLM-guided, intent-aware visual exploration. The proposed system combines UML-based visualization, dynamic user interfaces, historical context, and collaborative features into an adaptive tool for code comprehension. By interpreting user queries and interaction patterns, the LLM helps developers navigate and understand complex codebases more effectively. A prototype implementation for Java demonstrates the feasibility of this approach. Future work includes empirical evaluation, scaling to polyglot systems, and exploring GUI-driven LLM interaction models. This research lays the groundwork for intelligent, interactive environments that align with developer cognition and collaborative workflows.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach that integrates vision foundation models with reinforcement learning to enhance object interaction capabilities in simulated environments. By combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and YOLOv5 with a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent operating in the AI2-THOR simulation environment, we enable the agent to perceive and interact with objects more effectively. Our comprehensive experiments, conducted across four diverse indoor kitchen settings, demonstrate significant improvements in object interaction success rates and navigation efficiency compared to a baseline agent without advanced perception. The results show a 68% increase in average cumulative reward, a 52.5% improvement in object interaction success rate, and a 33% increase in navigation efficiency. These findings highlight the potential of integrating foundation models with reinforcement learning for complex robotic tasks, paving the way for more sophisticated and capable autonomous agents.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics increasingly permeate society, ensuring the ethical behavior of these systems has become paramount. This paper contends that transparency in AI decision-making processes is fundamental to developing trustworthy and ethically aligned robotic systems. We explore how transparency facilitates accountability, enables informed consent, and supports the debugging of ethical algorithms. The paper outlines technical, ethical, and practical challenges in implementing transparency and proposes novel approaches to enhance it, including standardized metrics, explainable AI techniques, and user-friendly interfaces. This paper introduces a framework that connects technical implementation with ethical considerations in robotic systems, focusing on the specific challenges of achieving transparency in dynamic, real-world contexts. We analyze how prioritizing transparency can impact public trust, regulatory policies, and avenues for future research. By positioning transparency as a fundamental element in ethical AI system design, we aim to add to the ongoing discussion on responsible AI and robotics, providing direction for future advancements in this vital field.

Abstract: Affective Computing has been established as a crucial field of inquiry to advance the holistic development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. Foundation models -- especially Large Language Models (LLMs) -- have been evaluated, trained, or instruction-tuned in several past works, to become better predictors or generators of emotion. Most of these studies, however, approach emotion-related tasks in a supervised manner, assessing or training the capabilities of LLMs using discrete emotion labels associated with stimuli (e.g., text, images, video, audio). Evaluation studies, in particular, have often been limited to standard and superficial emotion-related tasks, such as the recognition of evoked or expressed emotions. In this paper, we move beyond surface-level emotion tasks to investigate how LLMs reason about emotions through cognitive dimensions. Drawing from cognitive appraisal theory, we examine whether LLMs produce coherent and plausible cognitive reasoning when reasoning about emotionally charged stimuli. We introduce a large-scale benchmark on Cognitive Reasoning for Emotions - CoRE - to evaluate internal cognitive structures implicitly used by LLMs for emotional reasoning. Through a plethora of evaluation experiments and analysis, we seek to answer: (a) Are models more likely to implicitly rely on specific cognitive appraisal dimensions?, (b) What cognitive dimensions are important for characterizing specific emotions?, and, (c) Can the internal representations of different emotion categories in LLMs be interpreted through cognitive appraisal dimensions? Our results and analyses reveal diverse reasoning patterns across different LLMs. Our benchmark and code will be made publicly available.

However, there is still scarce empirical evidence on whether these principles are recognized, valued, or impactful from the perspective of users. This study investigates the link between ethical AI and user satisfaction by analyzing over 100,000 user reviews of AI products from G2. Using transformer-based language models, we measure sentiment across seven ethical dimensions defined by the EU Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI. Our findings show that all seven dimensions are positively associated with user satisfaction. Yet, this relationship varies systematically across user and product types. Technical users and reviewers of AI development platforms more frequently discuss system-level concerns (e.g., transparency, data governance), while non-technical users and reviewers of end-user applications emphasize human-centric dimensions (e.g., human agency, societal well-being). Moreover, the association between ethical AI and user satisfaction is significantly stronger for non-technical users and end-user applications across all dimensions. Our results highlight the importance of ethical AI design from users' perspectives and underscore the need to account for contextual differences across user roles and product types.

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities continue to undermine the reliability and security of modern systems, particularly as software complexity outpaces the capabilities of traditional detection methods. This study introduces a genetic algorithm-based method for test input generation that innovatively integrates genetic operators and adaptive learning to enhance software vulnerability detection. A key contribution is the application of the crossover operator, which facilitates exploration by searching across a broader space of potential test inputs. Complementing this, an adaptive feedback mechanism continuously learns from the system's execution behavior and dynamically guides input generation toward promising areas of the input space. Rather than relying on fixed or randomly selected inputs, the approach evolves a population of structurally valid test cases using feedback-driven selection, enabling deeper and more effective code traversal. This strategic integration of exploration and exploitation ensures that both diverse and targeted test inputs are developed over time. Evaluation was conducted across nine open-source JSON-processing libraries. The proposed method achieved substantial improvements in coverage compared to a benchmark evolutionary fuzzing method, with average gains of 39.8% in class coverage, 62.4% in method coverage, 105.0% in line coverage, 114.0% in instruction coverage, and 166.0% in branch coverage. These results highlight the method's capacity to detect deeper and more complex vulnerabilities, offering a scalable and adaptive solution to software security testing.

Abstract: The affective brain-computer interface is a crucial technology for affective interaction and emotional intelligence, emerging as a significant area of research in the human-computer interaction. Compared to single-type features, multi-type EEG features provide a multi-level representation for analyzing multi-dimensional emotions. However, the high dimensionality of multi-type EEG features, combined with the relatively small number of high-quality EEG samples, poses challenges such as classifier overfitting and suboptimal real-time performance in multi-dimensional emotion recognition. Moreover, practical applications of affective brain-computer interface frequently encounters partial absence of multi-dimensional emotional labels due to the open nature of the acquisition environment, and ambiguity and variability in individual emotion perception. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel EEG feature selection method for missing multi-dimensional emotion recognition. The method leverages adaptive orthogonal non-negative matrix factorization to reconstruct the multi-dimensional emotional label space through second-order and higher-order correlations, which could reduce the negative impact of missing values and outliers on label reconstruction. Simultaneously, it employs least squares regression with graph-based manifold learning regularization and global feature redundancy minimization regularization to enable EEG feature subset selection despite missing information, ultimately achieving robust EEG-based multi-dimensional emotion recognition. Simulation experiments on three widely used multi-dimensional emotional datasets, DREAMER, DEAP and HDED, reveal that the proposed method outperforms thirteen advanced feature selection methods in terms of robustness for EEG emotional feature selection.

<title>ASLSL: Adaptive shared latent structure learning with incomplete multi-modal physiological data for multi-dimensional emotional feature selection</title>

Abstract: Recently, multi-modal physiological signals based emotion recognition has garnered increasing attention in the field of brain-computer interfaces. Nevertheness, the associated multi-modal physiological features are often high-dimensional and inevitably include irrelevant, redundant, and noisy representation, which can easily lead to overfitting, poor performance, and high computational complexity in emotion classifiers. Feature selection has been widely applied to address these challenges. However, previous studies generally assumed that multi-modal physiological data are complete, whereas in reality, the data are often incomplete due to the openness of the acquisition and operational environment. For example, a part of samples are available in several modalities but not in others. To address this issue, we propose a novel method for incomplete multi-modal physiological signal feature selection called adaptive shared latent structure learning (ASLSL). Based on the property that similar features share similar emotional labels, ASLSL employs adaptive shared latent structure learning to explore a common latent space shared for incomplete multi-modal physiological signals and multi-dimensional emotional labels, thereby mitigating the impact of missing information and mining consensus information. Two most popular multi-modal physiological emotion datasets (DEAP and DREAMER) with multi-dimensional emotional labels were utilized to compare the performance between compare ASLSL and seventeen feature selection methods. Comprehensive experimental results on these datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ASLSL.

Abstract: Detecting prosociality in text--communication intended to affirm, support, or improve others' behavior--is a novel and increasingly important challenge for trust and safety systems. Unlike toxic content detection, prosociality lacks well-established definitions and labeled data, requiring new approaches to both annotation and deployment. We present a practical, three-stage pipeline that enables scalable, high-precision prosocial content classification while minimizing human labeling effort and inference costs. First, we identify the best LLM-based labeling strategy using a small seed set of human-labeled examples. We then introduce a human-AI refinement loop, where annotators review high-disagreement cases between GPT-4 and humans to iteratively clarify and expand the task definition-a critical step for emerging annotation tasks like prosociality. This process results in improved label quality and definition alignment. Finally, we synthesize 10k high-quality labels using GPT-4 and train a two-stage inference system: a lightweight classifier handles high-confidence predictions, while only $\sim$35\% of ambiguous instances are escalated to GPT-4o. This architecture reduces inference costs by $\sim$70% while achieving high precision ($\sim$0.90). Our pipeline demonstrates how targeted human-AI interaction, careful task formulation, and deployment-aware architecture design can unlock scalable solutions for novel responsible AI tasks.

<title>A 3DGS-Diffusion Self-Supervised Framework for Normal Estimation from a Single Image</title>

Abstract: The lack of spatial dimensional information remains a challenge in normal estimation from a single image. Recent diffusion-based methods have demonstrated significant potential in 2D-to-3D implicit mapping, they rely on data-driven statistical priors and miss the explicit modeling of light-surface interaction, leading to multi-view normal direction conflicts. Moreover, the discrete sampling mechanism of diffusion models causes gradient discontinuity in differentiable rendering reconstruction modules, preventing 3D geometric errors from being backpropagated to the normal generation network, thereby forcing existing methods to depend on dense normal annotations. This paper proposes SINGAD, a novel Self-supervised framework from a single Image for Normal estimation via 3D GAussian splatting guided Diffusion. By integrating physics-driven light-interaction modeling and a differentiable rendering-based reprojection strategy, our framework directly converts 3D geometric errors into normal optimization signals, solving the challenges of multi-view geometric inconsistency and data dependency. Specifically, the framework constructs a light-interaction-driven 3DGS reparameterization model to generate multi-scale geometric features consistent with light transport principles, ensuring multi-view normal consistency. A cross-domain feature fusion module is designed within a conditional diffusion model, embedding geometric priors to constrain normal generation while maintaining accurate geometric error propagation. Furthermore, a differentiable 3D reprojection loss strategy is introduced for self-supervised optimization that minimizes geometric error between the reconstructed and input image, eliminating dependence on annotated normal datasets. Quantitative evaluations on the Google Scanned Objects dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple metrics.

Abstract: There is growing interest in integrating high-fidelity visual synthesis capabilities into large language models (LLMs) without compromising their strong reasoning capabilities. Existing methods that directly train LLMs or bridge LLMs and diffusion models usually suffer from costly training since the backbone LLMs have not seen image representations during pretraining. We present Bifrost-1, a unified framework that bridges pretrained multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and diffusion models using patch-level CLIP image embeddings as latent variables, which are natively aligned with the MLLM's CLIP visual encoder. These patch-level image embeddings are integrated into the diffusion model with a lightweight adaptation of its ControlNet. To retain the original multimodal reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, we equip the MLLM with a visual generation branch initialized from the original MLLM parameters when predicting the patch-level image embeddings. By seamlessly integrating pretrained MLLMs and diffusion models with patch-level CLIP latents, our framework enables high-fidelity controllable image generation with significant training efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that Bifrost-1 achieves comparable or better performance than previous methods in terms of visual fidelity and multimodal understanding, with substantially lower compute during training. We also provide comprehensive ablation studies showing the effectiveness of our design choices.

Abstract: Decision trees, without appropriate constraints, can easily become overly complex and prone to overfit, capturing noise rather than generalizable patterns. To resolve this problem,pruning operation is a crucial part in optimizing decision trees, as it not only reduces the complexity of trees but also decreases the probability of generating overfit models. The conventional pruning techniques like Cost-Complexity Pruning (CCP) and Reduced Error Pruning (REP) are mostly based on greedy approaches that focus on immediate gains in performance while pruning nodes of the decision tree. However, this might result in a lower generalization in the long run, compromising the robust ability of the tree model when introduced to unseen data samples, particularly when trained with small and complex datasets. To address this challenge, we are proposing a Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB)-based pruning approach, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based technique, that will dynamically prune the tree to generate an optimal decision tree with better generalization. Our proposed approach assumes the pruning process as an exploration-exploitation problem, where we are utilizing the MAB algorithms to find optimal branch nodes to prune based on feedback from each pruning actions. Experimental evaluation on several benchmark datasets, demonstrated that our proposed approach results in better predictive performance compared to the traditional ones. This suggests the potential of utilizing MAB for a dynamic and probabilistic way of decision tree pruning, in turn optimizing the decision tree-based model.

<title>Mildly Conservative Regularized Evaluation for Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) seeks to learn optimal policies from static datasets without further environment interaction. A key challenge is the distribution shift between the learned and behavior policies, leading to out-of-distribution (OOD) actions and overestimation. To prevent gross overestimation, the value function must remain conservative; however, excessive conservatism may hinder performance improvement. To address this, we propose the mildly conservative regularized evaluation (MCRE) framework, which balances conservatism and performance by combining temporal difference (TD) error with a behavior cloning term in the Bellman backup. Building on this, we develop the mildly conservative regularized Q-learning (MCRQ) algorithm, which integrates MCRE into an off-policy actor-critic framework. Experiments show that MCRQ outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has recently demonstrated considerable potential for repository-level code completion, as it integrates cross-file knowledge with in-file preceding code to provide comprehensive contexts for generation. To better understand the contribution of the retrieved cross-file contexts, we introduce a likelihood-based metric to evaluate the impact of each retrieved code chunk on the completion. Our analysis reveals that, despite retrieving numerous chunks, only a small subset positively contributes to the completion, while some chunks even degrade performance. To address this issue, we leverage this metric to construct a repository-level dataset where each retrieved chunk is labeled as positive, neutral, or negative based on its relevance to the target completion. We then propose an adaptive retrieval context filtering framework, CODEFILTER, trained on this dataset to mitigate the harmful effects of negative retrieved contexts in code completion. Extensive evaluation on the RepoEval and CrossCodeLongEval benchmarks demonstrates that CODEFILTER consistently improves completion accuracy compared to approaches without filtering operations across various tasks. Additionally, CODEFILTER significantly reduces the length of the input prompt, enhancing computational efficiency while exhibiting strong generalizability across different models. These results underscore the potential of CODEFILTER to enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and attributability of repository-level code completion.

Abstract: Singing Voice Conversion (SVC) transfers a source singer's timbre to a target while keeping melody and lyrics. The key challenge in any-to-any SVC is adapting unseen speaker timbres to source audio without quality degradation. Existing methods either face timbre leakage or fail to achieve satisfactory timbre similarity and quality in the generated audio. To address these challenges, we propose DAFMSVC, where the self-supervised learning (SSL) features from the source audio are replaced with the most similar SSL features from the target audio to prevent timbre leakage. It also incorporates a dual cross-attention mechanism for the adaptive fusion of speaker embeddings, melody, and linguistic content. Additionally, we introduce a flow matching module for high quality audio generation from the fused features. Experimental results show that DAFMSVC significantly enhances timbre similarity and naturalness, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both subjective and objective evaluations.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are often used as virtual tutors in computer science (CS) education, this approach can foster passive learning and over-reliance. This paper presents a novel pedagogical paradigm that inverts this model: students act as instructors who must teach an LLM to solve problems. To facilitate this, we developed strategies for designing questions with engineered knowledge gaps that only a student can bridge, and we introduce Socrates, a system for deploying this method with minimal overhead. We evaluated our approach in an undergraduate course and found that this active-learning method led to statistically significant improvements in student performance compared to historical cohorts. Our work demonstrates a practical, cost-effective framework for using LLMs to deepen student engagement and mastery.

Abstract: We propose a method for test-time adaptation of pretrained depth completion models. Depth completion models, trained on some ``source'' data, often predict erroneous outputs when transferred to ``target'' data captured in novel environmental conditions due to a covariate shift. The crux of our method lies in quantifying the likelihood of depth predictions belonging to the source data distribution. The challenge is in the lack of access to out-of-distribution (target) data prior to deployment. Hence, rather than making assumptions regarding the target distribution, we utilize adversarial perturbations as a mechanism to explore the data space. This enables us to train an energy model that scores local regions of depth predictions as in- or out-of-distribution. We update the parameters of pretrained depth completion models at test time to minimize energy, effectively aligning test-time predictions to those of the source distribution. We call our method ``Energy-based Test-time Adaptation'', or ETA for short. We evaluate our method across three indoor and three outdoor datasets, where ETA improve over the previous state-of-the-art method by an average of 6.94% for outdoors and 10.23% for indoors.

Abstract: Emotion recognition plays a vital role in enhancing human-computer interaction. In this study, we tackle the MER-SEMI challenge of the MER2025 competition by proposing a novel multimodal emotion recognition framework. To address the issue of data scarcity, we leverage large-scale pre-trained models to extract informative features from visual, audio, and textual modalities. Specifically, for the visual modality, we design a dual-branch visual encoder that captures both global frame-level features and localized facial representations. For the textual modality, we introduce a context-enriched method that employs large language models to enrich emotional cues within the input text. To effectively integrate these multimodal features, we propose a fusion strategy comprising two key components, i.e., self-attention mechanisms for dynamic modality weighting, and residual connections to preserve original representations. Beyond architectural design, we further refine noisy labels in the training set by a multi-source labeling strategy. Our approach achieves a substantial performance improvement over the official baseline on the MER2025-SEMI dataset, attaining a weighted F-score of 87.49% compared to 78.63%, thereby validating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Operational skill learning, inherently physical and reliant on hands-on practice and kinesthetic feedback, has yet to be effectively replicated in large language model (LLM)-supported training. Current LLM training assistants primarily generate customized textual feedback, neglecting the crucial kinesthetic modality. This gap derives from the textual and uncertain nature of LLMs, compounded by concerns on user acceptance of LLM driven body control. To bridge this gap and realize the potential of collaborative human-LLM action, this work explores human experience of LLM driven kinesthetic assistance. Specifically, we introduced an "Align-Analyze-Adjust" strategy and developed FlightAxis, a tool that integrates LLM with Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) for flight skill acquisition, a representative operational skill domain. FlightAxis learns flight skills from manuals and guides forearm movements during simulated flight tasks. Our results demonstrate high user acceptance of LLM-mediated body control and significantly reduced task completion times. Crucially, trainees reported that this kinesthetic assistance enhanced their awareness of operation flaws and fostered increased engagement in the training process, rather than relieving perceived load. This work demonstrated the potential of kinesthetic LLM training in operational skill acquisition.

Abstract: The quadratic computational cost of the self-attention mechanism is a primary challenge in scaling Transformer models. While attention sparsity is widely studied as a technique to improve computational efficiency, it is almost universally assumed to come at the cost of model accuracy. In this paper, we report a surprising counter-example to this common wisdom. By introducing structured, post-hoc sparsity to the attention mechanism of a DistilBERT model during fine-tuning on the SST-2 sentiment analysis task, we find that model accuracy improves significantly. Our model with 80\% attention sparsity achieves a validation accuracy of 91.59\%, a 0.97\% absolute improvement over the dense baseline. We hypothesize that this phenomenon is due to sparsity acting as a powerful implicit regularizer, preventing the model from overfitting by forcing it to make predictions with a more constrained and robust set of features. Our work recasts attention sparsity not just as a tool for computational efficiency, but as a potential method for improving the generalization and performance of Transformer models.

Abstract: Sub-visible particle analysis using flow imaging microscopy combined with deep learning has proven effective in identifying particle types, enabling the distinction of harmless components such as silicone oil from protein particles. However, the scarcity of available data and severe imbalance between particle types within datasets remain substantial hurdles when applying multi-class classifiers to such problems, often forcing researchers to rely on less effective methods. The aforementioned issue is particularly challenging for particle types that appear unintentionally and in lower numbers, such as silicone oil and air bubbles, as opposed to protein particles, where obtaining large numbers of images through controlled settings is comparatively straightforward. In this work, we develop a state-of-the-art diffusion model to address data imbalance by generating high-fidelity images that can augment training datasets, enabling the effective training of multi-class deep neural networks. We validate this approach by demonstrating that the generated samples closely resemble real particle images in terms of visual quality and structure. To assess the effectiveness of using diffusion-generated images in training datasets, we conduct large-scale experiments on a validation dataset comprising 500,000 protein particle images and demonstrate that this approach improves classification performance with no negligible downside. Finally, to promote open research and reproducibility, we publicly release both our diffusion models and the trained multi-class deep neural network classifiers, along with a straightforward interface for easy integration into future studies, at https://github.com/utkuozbulak/svp-generative-ai.

Abstract: Self-Rewarding Language Models propose an architecture in which the Large Language Models(LLMs) both generates responses and evaluates its own outputs via LLM-as-a-Judge prompting, dynamically improving its generative capabilities through iterative Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). However, our analysis reveals a critical limitation in existing Self-Rewarding paradigms: the synchronized improvement of chosen and rejected responses progressively narrows the representational difference between contrasting samples, undermining effective preference learning. We propose \textbf{Temporal Self-Rewarding Language Models} that strategically coordinate past, present, and future model generations to sustain learning signals. Our dual-phase framework introduces: (1) \textit{Anchored Rejection} - fixing rejected responses using the past initial model's outputs and (2) \textit{Future-Guided Chosen} - dynamically curating chosen samples using next-generation model predictions. Extensive experiments across three model families (Llama, Qwen, Mistral) and different model sizes (Llama3B/8B/70B) demonstrate significant improvements when trained with our method compared to Self-Rewarding using same computation resources. For example, Llama3.1-8B reaches a 29.44 win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0 with our method, outperforming the Self-Rewarding baseline (19.69) by 9.75. Notably, our method also demonstrates superior out-of-distribution generalization across mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), knowledge-based QA (ARC, TruthfulQA), and code generation (HumanEval) tasks, even though we do not specifically collect such training data.

Abstract: Heterogeneous graphs (HGs) are common in real-world scenarios and often exhibit heterophily. However, most existing studies focus on either heterogeneity or heterophily in isolation, overlooking the prevalence of heterophilic HGs in practical applications. Such ignorance leads to their performance degradation. In this work, we first identify two main challenges in modeling heterophily HGs: (1) varying heterophily distributions across hops and meta-paths; (2) the intricate and often heterophily-driven diversity of semantic information across different meta-paths. Then, we propose the Adaptive Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (AHGNN) to tackle these challenges. AHGNN employs a heterophily-aware convolution that accounts for heterophily distributions specific to both hops and meta-paths. It then integrates messages from diverse semantic spaces using a coarse-to-fine attention mechanism, which filters out noise and emphasizes informative signals. Experiments on seven real-world graphs and twenty baselines demonstrate the superior performance of AHGNN, particularly in high-heterophily situations.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) typically replace the predefined image placeholder token () in textual instructions with visual features from an image encoder, forming the input to a backbone Large Language Model (LLM). However, the large number of vision tokens significantly increases the context length, leading to high computational overhead and inference latency. While previous efforts mitigate this by selecting only important visual features or leveraging learnable queries to reduce token count, they often compromise performance or introduce substantial extra costs. In response, we propose Fourier-VLM, a simple yet efficient method that compresses visual representations in the frequency domain. Our approach is motivated by the observation that vision features output from the vision encoder exhibit concentrated energy in low-frequency components. Leveraging this, we apply a low-pass filter to the vision features using a two-dimentional Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Notably, the DCT is efficiently computed via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operator with a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$, minimizing the extra computational cost while introducing no additional parameters. Extensive experiments across various image-based benchmarks demonstrate that Fourier-VLM achieves competitive performance with strong generalizability across both LLaVA and Qwen-VL architectures. Crucially, it reduce inference FLOPs by up to 83.8% and boots generation speed by 31.2% compared to LLaVA-v1.5, highlighting the superior efficiency and practicality.

Abstract: How can we effectively handle queries for on-device large language models (LLMs) with varying runtime constraints, such as latency and accuracy? Multi-scale quantization addresses this challenge by enabling memory-efficient runtime model adaptation of LLMs through the overlaying of multiple model variants quantized to different bitwidths. Meanwhile, an important question still remains open-ended: how can models be properly configured to match a target precision or latency? While mixed-precision offers a promising solution, we take this further by leveraging the key observation that the sensitivity of each layer dynamically changes across decoding iterations. Building on this insight, we introduce DP-LLM, a novel mechanism that dynamically assigns precision to each layer based on input values. DP-LLM augments each linear layer in an LLM with a precision selector that determines the bitwidth at runtime using a lightweight error estimator and threshold values learned through fine-tuning. Experimental results across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that DP-LLM achieves a superior performance-latency trade-off, outperforming prior approaches.

<title>EvolvR: Self-Evolving Pairwise Reasoning for Story Evaluation to Enhance Generation</title>

Abstract: Although the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges (LLM-as-a-judge) has been validated, their performance remains limited in open-ended tasks, particularly in story evaluation. Accurate story evaluation is crucial not only for assisting human quality judgment but also for providing key signals to guide story generation. However, existing methods face a dilemma: prompt engineering for closed-source models suffers from poor adaptability, while fine-tuning approaches for open-source models lack the rigorous reasoning capabilities essential for story evaluation. To address this, we propose the Self-Evolving Pairwise Reasoning (EvolvR) framework. Grounded in pairwise comparison, the framework first self-synthesizes score-aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data via a multi-persona strategy. To ensure data quality, these raw CoTs undergo a self-filtering process, utilizing multi-agents to guarantee their logical rigor and robustness. Finally, the evaluator trained on the refined data is deployed as a reward model to guide the story generation task. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on three evaluation benchmarks including StoryER, HANNA and OpenMEVA. Furthermore, when served as a reward model, it significantly enhances the quality of generated stories, thereby fully validating the superiority of our self-evolving approach.

Abstract: Generative AI has made image creation more accessible, yet aligning outputs with nuanced creative intent remains challenging, particularly for non-experts. Existing tools often require users to externalize ideas through prompts or references, limiting fluid exploration. We introduce ThematicPlane, a system that enables users to navigate and manipulate high-level semantic concepts (e.g., mood, style, or narrative tone) within an interactive thematic design plane. This interface bridges the gap between tacit creative intent and system control. In our exploratory study (N=6), participants engaged in divergent and convergent creative modes, often embracing unexpected results as inspiration or iteration cues. While they grounded their exploration in familiar themes, differing expectations of how themes mapped to outputs revealed a need for more explainable controls. Overall, ThematicPlane fosters expressive, iterative workflows and highlights new directions for intuitive, semantics-driven interaction in generative design tools.

<title>Architecture-Aware Generalization Bounds for Temporal Networks: Theory and Fair Comparison Methodology</title>

Abstract: Deep temporal architectures such as Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) achieve strong predictive performance on sequential data, yet theoretical understanding of their generalization remains limited. We address this gap by providing both the first non-vacuous, architecture-aware generalization bounds for deep temporal models and a principled evaluation methodology.
  For exponentially $\beta$-mixing sequences, we derive bounds scaling as $ O\!\Bigl(R\,\sqrt{\tfrac{D\,p\,n\,\log N}{N}}\Bigr), $ where $D$ is network depth, $p$ kernel size, $n$ input dimension, and $R$ weight norm. Our delayed-feedback blocking mechanism transforms dependent samples into effectively independent ones while discarding only $O(1/\log N)$ of the data, yielding $\sqrt{D}$ scaling instead of exponential, implying that doubling depth requires approximately quadrupling the training data.
  We also introduce a fair-comparison methodology that fixes the effective sample size to isolate the effect of temporal structure from information content. Under $N_{\text{eff}}=2{,}000$, strongly dependent sequences ($\rho=0.8$) exhibit $\approx76\%$ smaller generalization gaps than weakly dependent ones ($\rho=0.2$), challenging the intuition that dependence is purely detrimental. Yet convergence rates diverge from theory: weak dependencies follow $N_{\text{eff}}^{-1.21}$ scaling and strong dependencies follow $N_{\text{eff}}^{-0.89}$, both steeper than the predicted $N^{-0.5}$. These findings reveal that temporal dependence can enhance learning under fixed information budgets, while highlighting gaps between theory and practice that motivate future research.

Abstract: Evaluating the abilities of large models and manifesting their gaps are challenging. Current benchmarks adopt either ground-truth-based score-form evaluation on static datasets or indistinct textual chatbot-style human preferences collection, which may not provide users with immediate, intuitive, and perceptible feedback on performance differences. In this paper, we introduce BioMotion Arena, a novel framework for evaluating large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via visual animation. Our methodology draws inspiration from the inherent visual perception of motion patterns characteristic of living organisms that utilizes point-light source imaging to amplify the performance discrepancies between models. Specifically, we employ a pairwise comparison evaluation and collect more than 45k votes for 53 mainstream LLMs and MLLMs on 90 biological motion variants. Data analyses show that the crowd-sourced human votes are in good agreement with those of expert raters, demonstrating the superiority of our BioMotion Arena in offering discriminative feedback. We also find that over 90\% of evaluated models, including the cutting-edge open-source InternVL3 and proprietary Claude-4 series, fail to produce fundamental humanoid point-light groups, much less smooth and biologically plausible motions. This enables BioMotion Arena to serve as a challenging benchmark for performance visualization and a flexible evaluation framework without restrictions on ground-truth.

Abstract: To treat Trochlear Dysplasia (TD), current approaches rely mainly on low-resolution clinical Magnetic Resonance (MR) scans and surgical intuition. The surgeries are planned based on surgeons experience, have limited adoption of minimally invasive techniques, and lead to inconsistent outcomes. We propose a pipeline that generates super-resolved, patient-specific 3D pseudo-healthy target morphologies from conventional clinical MR scans. First, we compute an isotropic super-resolved MR volume using an Implicit Neural Representation (INR). Next, we segment femur, tibia, patella, and fibula with a multi-label custom-trained network. Finally, we train a Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM) to generate pseudo-healthy target morphologies of the trochlear region. In contrast to prior work producing pseudo-healthy low-resolution 3D MR images, our approach enables the generation of sub-millimeter resolved 3D shapes compatible for pre- and intraoperative use. These can serve as preoperative blueprints for reshaping the femoral groove while preserving the native patella articulation. Furthermore, and in contrast to other work, we do not require a CT for our pipeline - reducing the amount of radiation. We evaluated our approach on 25 TD patients and could show that our target morphologies significantly improve the sulcus angle (SA) and trochlear groove depth (TGD). The code and interactive visualization are available at https://wehrlimi.github.io/sr-3d-planning/.

Abstract: Recent work on visual world models shows significant promise in latent state dynamics obtained from pre-trained image backbones. However, most of the current approaches are sensitive to training quality, requiring near-complete coverage of the action and state space during training to prevent divergence during inference. To make a model-based planning algorithm more robust to the quality of the learned world model, we propose in this work to use a variational autoencoder as a novelty detector to ensure that proposed action trajectories during planning do not cause the learned model to deviate from the training data distribution. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, a series of experiments in challenging simulated robot environments was carried out, with the proposed method incorporated into a model-predictive control policy loop extending the DINO-WM architecture. The results clearly show that the proposed method improves over state-of-the-art solutions in terms of data efficiency.

Abstract: Recent developments in diffusion- and flow- based models have significantly advanced Text-to-Audio Generation (TTA). While achieving great synthesis quality and controllability, current TTA systems still suffer from slow inference speed, which significantly limits their practical applicability. This paper presents MeanAudio, a novel MeanFlow-based model tailored for fast and faithful text-to-audio generation. Built on a Flux-style latent transformer, MeanAudio regresses the average velocity field during training, enabling fast generation by mapping directly from the start to the endpoint of the flow trajectory. By incorporating classifier-free guidance (CFG) into the training target, MeanAudio incurs no additional cost in the guided sampling process. To further stabilize training, we propose an instantaneous-to-mean curriculum with flow field mix-up, which encourages the model to first learn the foundational instantaneous dynamics, and then gradually adapt to mean flows. This strategy proves critical for enhancing training efficiency and generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that MeanAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-step audio generation. Specifically, it achieves a real time factor (RTF) of 0.013 on a single NVIDIA RTX 3090, yielding a 100x speedup over SOTA diffusion-based TTA systems. Moreover, MeanAudio also demonstrates strong performance in multi-step generation, enabling smooth and coherent transitions across successive synthesis steps.

Abstract: Recognizing handwritten mathematical expressions (HMER) is a challenging task due to the inherent two-dimensional structure, varying symbol scales, and complex spatial relationships among symbols. In this paper, we present a self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for HMER that eliminates the need for expensive labeled data. Our approach begins by pretraining an image encoder using a combination of global and local contrastive loss, enabling the model to learn both holistic and fine-grained representations. A key contribution of this work is a novel self-supervised attention network, which is trained using a progressive spatial masking strategy. This attention mechanism is designed to learn semantically meaningful focus regions, such as operators, exponents, and nested mathematical notation, without requiring any supervision. The progressive masking curriculum encourages the network to become increasingly robust to missing or occluded visual information, ultimately improving structural understanding. Our complete pipeline consists of (1) self-supervised pretraining of the encoder, (2) self-supervised attention learning, and (3) supervised fine-tuning with a transformer decoder to generate LATEX sequences. Extensive experiments on CROHME benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing SSL and fully supervised baselines, validating the effectiveness of our progressive attention mechanism in enhancing HMER performance. Our codebase can be found here.

Abstract: Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) with sparse rewards remains a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning. While hindsight experience replay (HER) has shown promise by relabeling collected trajectories with achieved goals, we argue that trajectory relabeling alone does not fully exploit the available experiences in off-policy GCRL methods, resulting in limited sample efficiency. In this paper, we propose Hindsight Goal-conditioned Regularization (HGR), a technique that generates action regularization priors based on hindsight goals. When combined with hindsight self-imitation regularization (HSR), our approach enables off-policy RL algorithms to maximize experience utilization. Compared to existing GCRL methods that employ HER and self-imitation techniques, our hindsight regularizations achieve substantially more efficient sample reuse and the best performances, which we empirically demonstrate on a suite of navigation and manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) face interpretability challenges due to their opaque internal representations. While Feature Map Convergence Evaluation (FMCE) quantifies module-level convergence via Feature Map Convergence Scores (FMCS), it lacks experimental validation and closed-loop integration. To address this limitation, we propose FMCE-Net++, a novel training framework that integrates a pretrained, frozen FMCE-Net as an auxiliary head. This module generates FMCS predictions, which, combined with task labels, jointly supervise backbone optimization through a Representation Auxiliary Loss. The RAL dynamically balances the primary classification loss and feature convergence optimization via a tunable \Representation Abstraction Factor. Extensive experiments conducted on MNIST, CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that FMCE-Net++ consistently enhances model performance without architectural modifications or additional data. Key experimental outcomes include accuracy gains of $+1.16$ pp (ResNet-50/CIFAR-10) and $+1.08$ pp (ShuffleNet v2/CIFAR-100), validating that FMCE-Net++ can effectively elevate state-of-the-art performance ceilings.

Abstract: We study the problem of serving LLM (Large Language Model) requests where each request has heterogeneous prefill and decode lengths. In LLM serving, the prefill length corresponds to the input prompt length, which determines the initial memory usage in the KV cache. The decode length refers to the number of output tokens generated sequentially, with each additional token increasing the KV cache memory usage by one unit. Given a set of n requests, our goal is to schedule and process them to minimize the total completion time. We show that this problem is NP-hard due to the interplay of batching, placement constraints, precedence relationships, and linearly increasing memory usage. We then analyze commonly used scheduling strategies in practice, such as First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) and Shortest-First (SF), and prove that their competitive ratios scale up sublinearly with the memory limit-a significant drawback in real-world settings where memory demand is large. To address this, we propose a novel algorithm based on a new selection metric that efficiently forms batches over time. We prove that this algorithm achieves a constant competitive ratio. Finally, we develop and evaluate a few algorithm variants inspired by this approach, including dynamic programming variants, local search methods, and an LP-based scheduler, demonstrating through comprehensive simulations that they outperform standard baselines while maintaining computational efficiency.

<title>Less is More: Selective Reflection for Compatible and Efficient Knowledge Distillation in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a fundamental technique for compressing large language models (LLMs) into compact, efficient student models. However, existing white-box KD methods mainly focus on balancing ground truth and student-generated responses while overlooking two critical factors: training data quality and student-model compatibility. To address these limitations, we propose Selective Reflection Distillation (SRD), a novel data curation framework that leverages reflections from student models to systematically refine training data. SRD dynamically evaluates and selects prompt-response pairs by comparing ground truth data with student model outputs, selectively curating high-quality, student-compatible training instances through automated ranking based on difficulty. Furthermore, after selecting the training data, a curriculum scheduling strategy is employed to incrementally introduce these curated subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals. As a plug-and-play enhancement, SRD consistently improves distillation outcomes across diverse white-box KD approaches and model architectures, as well as decreases computational cost significantly during KD training. Experiments on a range of language model benchmarks demonstrate SRD's consistent improvements in distilled model performance, as well as a reduction in training runtime by up to 39%, under diverse KD methods and model families. Notably, SRD operates as a plug-and-play module, enhancing sample efficiency without modifying underlying KD algorithms. Our findings highlight that data quality and compatibility are pivotal to effective and efficient distillation of LLMs, and SRD provides a principled framework to achieve both. This work advances the understanding of data-centric factors in KD and offers practical insights for enhancing the capability and efficiency of compressed LLMs.

Abstract: We propose a novel 3D gaze redirection framework that leverages an explicit 3D eyeball structure. Existing gaze redirection methods are typically based on neural radiance fields, which employ implicit neural representations via volume rendering. Unlike these NeRF-based approaches, where the rotation and translation of 3D representations are not explicitly modeled, we introduce a dedicated 3D eyeball structure to represent the eyeballs with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our method generates photorealistic images that faithfully reproduce the desired gaze direction by explicitly rotating and translating the 3D eyeball structure. In addition, we propose an adaptive deformation module that enables the replication of subtle muscle movements around the eyes. Through experiments conducted on the ETH-XGaze dataset, we demonstrate that our framework is capable of generating diverse novel gaze images, achieving superior image quality and gaze estimation accuracy compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Multimodal recommendation systems have attracted increasing attention for their improved performance by leveraging items' multimodal information. Prior methods often build modality-specific item-item semantic graphs from raw modality features and use them as supplementary structures alongside the user-item interaction graph to enhance user preference learning. However, these semantic graphs suffer from semantic deficiencies, including (1) insufficient modeling of collaborative signals among items and (2) structural distortions introduced by noise in raw modality features, ultimately compromising performance. To address these issues, we first extract collaborative signals from the interaction graph and infuse them into each modality-specific item semantic graph to enhance semantic modeling. Then, we design a modulus-based personalized embedding perturbation mechanism that injects perturbations with modulus-guided personalized intensity into embeddings to generate contrastive views. This enables the model to learn noise-robust representations through contrastive learning, thereby reducing the effect of structural noise in semantic graphs. Besides, we propose a dual representation alignment mechanism that first aligns multiple semantic representations via a designed Anchor-based InfoNCE loss using behavior representations as anchors, and then aligns behavior representations with the fused semantics by standard InfoNCE, to ensure representation consistency. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our framework.

<title>One Size Does Not Fit All: A Distribution-Aware Sparsification for More Precise Model Merging</title>

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a compelling data-free paradigm for multi-task learning, enabling the fusion of multiple fine-tuned models into a single, powerful entity. A key technique in merging methods is sparsification, which prunes redundant parameters from task vectors to mitigate interference. However, prevailing approaches employ a ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy, applying a uniform sparsity ratio that overlooks the inherent structural and statistical heterogeneity of model parameters. This often leads to a suboptimal trade-off, where critical parameters are inadvertently pruned while less useful ones are retained. To address this limitation, we introduce \textbf{TADrop} (\textbf{T}ensor-wise \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{Drop}), an adaptive sparsification strategy that respects this heterogeneity. Instead of a global ratio, TADrop assigns a tailored sparsity level to each parameter tensor based on its distributional properties. The core intuition is that tensors with denser, more redundant distributions can be pruned aggressively, while sparser, more critical ones are preserved. As a simple and plug-and-play module, we validate TADrop by integrating it with foundational, classic, and SOTA merging methods. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks (vision, language, and multimodal) and models (ViT, BEiT) demonstrate that TADrop consistently and significantly boosts their performance. For instance, when enhancing a leading merging method, it achieves an average performance gain of 2.0\% across 8 ViT-B/32 tasks. TADrop provides a more effective way to mitigate parameter interference by tailoring sparsification to the model's structure, offering a new baseline for high-performance model merging.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities through two complementary paradigms: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which enhances knowledge grounding, and Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which optimizes complex reasoning abilities. However, these two capabilities are often developed in isolation, and existing efforts to unify them remain narrow in scope-typically limited to open-domain QA with fixed retrieval settings and task-specific assumptions. This lack of integration constrains generalization and limits the applicability of RAG-RL methods to broader domains. To bridge this gap, we propose UR2 (Unified RAG and Reasoning), a general framework that unifies retrieval and reasoning through reinforcement learning. UR2 introduces two key contributions: a difficulty-aware curriculum training that selectively invokes retrieval only for challenging problems, and a hybrid knowledge access strategy combining domain-specific offline corpora with LLM-generated summaries. These components are designed to enable dynamic coordination between retrieval and reasoning, improving adaptability across a diverse range of tasks. Experiments across open-domain QA, MMLU-Pro, medical, and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that UR2 (built on Qwen2.5-3/7B and LLaMA-3.1-8B) significantly outperforms existing RAG and RL methods, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4.1-mini on several benchmarks. We have released all code, models, and data at https://github.com/Tsinghua-dhy/UR2.

Abstract: Underwater 3D scene reconstruction faces severe challenges from light absorption, scattering, and turbidity, which degrade geometry and color fidelity in traditional methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). While NeRF extensions such as SeaThru-NeRF incorporate physics-based models, their MLP reliance limits efficiency and spatial resolution in hazy environments. We introduce UW-3DGS, a novel framework adapting 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for robust underwater reconstruction. Key innovations include: (1) a plug-and-play learnable underwater image formation module using voxel-based regression for spatially varying attenuation and backscatter; and (2) a Physics-Aware Uncertainty Pruning (PAUP) branch that adaptively removes noisy floating Gaussians via uncertainty scoring, ensuring artifact-free geometry. The pipeline operates in training and rendering stages. During training, noisy Gaussians are optimized end-to-end with underwater parameters, guided by PAUP pruning and scattering modeling. In rendering, refined Gaussians produce clean Unattenuated Radiance Images (URIs) free from media effects, while learned physics enable realistic Underwater Images (UWIs) with accurate light transport. Experiments on SeaThru-NeRF and UWBundle datasets show superior performance, achieving PSNR of 27.604, SSIM of 0.868, and LPIPS of 0.104 on SeaThru-NeRF, with ~65% reduction in floating artifacts.

Abstract: Colonoscopy is a vital tool for the early diagnosis of colorectal cancer, which is one of the main causes of cancer-related mortality globally; hence, it is deemed an essential technique for the prevention and early detection of colorectal cancer. The research introduces a unique multidirectional architectural framework to automate polyp detection within colonoscopy images while helping resolve limited healthcare dataset sizes and annotation complexities. The research implements a comprehensive system that delivers synthetic data generation through Stable Diffusion enhancements together with detection and segmentation algorithms. This detection approach combines Faster R-CNN for initial object localization while the Segment Anything Model (SAM) refines the segmentation masks. The faster R-CNN detection algorithm achieved a recall of 93.08% combined with a precision of 88.97% and an F1 score of 90.98%.SAM is then used to generate the image mask. The research evaluated five state-of-the-art segmentation models that included U-Net, PSPNet, FPN, LinkNet, and MANet using ResNet34 as a base model. The results demonstrate the superior performance of FPN with the highest scores of PSNR (7.205893) and SSIM (0.492381), while UNet excels in recall (84.85%) and LinkNet shows balanced performance in IoU (64.20%) and Dice score (77.53%).

<title>Differentially Private Federated Clustering with Random Rebalancing</title>

Abstract: Federated clustering aims to group similar clients into clusters and produce one model for each cluster. Such a personalization approach typically improves model performance compared with training a single model to serve all clients, but can be more vulnerable to privacy leakage. Directly applying client-level differentially private (DP) mechanisms to federated clustering could degrade the utilities significantly. We identify that such deficiencies are mainly due to the difficulties of averaging privacy noise within each cluster (following standard privacy mechanisms), as the number of clients assigned to the same clusters is uncontrolled. To this end, we propose a simple and effective technique, named RR-Cluster, that can be viewed as a light-weight add-on to many federated clustering algorithms. RR-Cluster achieves reduced privacy noise via randomly rebalancing cluster assignments, guaranteeing a minimum number of clients assigned to each cluster. We analyze the tradeoffs between decreased privacy noise variance and potentially increased bias from incorrect assignments and provide convergence bounds for RR-Clsuter. Empirically, we demonstrate the RR-Cluster plugged into strong federated clustering algorithms results in significantly improved privacy/utility tradeoffs across both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Pretrained neural networks have attracted significant interest in chemistry and small molecule drug design. Embeddings from these models are widely used for molecular property prediction, virtual screening, and small data learning in molecular chemistry. This study presents the most extensive comparison of such models to date, evaluating 25 models across 25 datasets. Under a fair comparison framework, we assess models spanning various modalities, architectures, and pretraining strategies. Using a dedicated hierarchical Bayesian statistical testing model, we arrive at a surprising result: nearly all neural models show negligible or no improvement over the baseline ECFP molecular fingerprint. Only the CLAMP model, which is also based on molecular fingerprints, performs statistically significantly better than the alternatives. These findings raise concerns about the evaluation rigor in existing studies. We discuss potential causes, propose solutions, and offer practical recommendations.

Abstract: Continual Visual Instruction Tuning (CVIT) enables Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to incrementally learn new tasks over time. However, this process is challenged by catastrophic forgetting, where performance on previously learned tasks deteriorates as the model adapts to new ones. A common approach to mitigate forgetting is architecture expansion, which introduces task-specific modules to prevent interference. Yet, existing methods often expand entire layers for each task, leading to significant parameter overhead and poor scalability. To overcome these issues, we introduce LoRA in LoRA (LiLoRA), a highly efficient architecture expansion method tailored for CVIT in MLLMs. LiLoRA shares the LoRA matrix A across tasks to reduce redundancy, applies an additional low-rank decomposition to matrix B to minimize task-specific parameters, and incorporates a cosine-regularized stability loss to preserve consistency in shared representations over time. Extensive experiments on a diverse CVIT benchmark show that LiLoRA consistently achieves superior performance in sequential task learning while significantly improving parameter efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Robust content moderation requires classification systems that can quickly adapt to evolving policies without costly retraining. We present classification using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shifts traditional classification tasks from determining the correct category in accordance with pre-trained parameters to evaluating content in relation to contextual knowledge retrieved at inference. In hate speech detection, this transforms the task from "is this hate speech?" to "does this violate the hate speech policy?"
  Our Contextual Policy Engine (CPE) - an agentic RAG system - demonstrates this approach and offers three key advantages: (1) robust classification accuracy comparable to leading commercial systems, (2) inherent explainability via retrieved policy segments, and (3) dynamic policy updates without model retraining. Through three experiments, we demonstrate strong baseline performance and show that the system can apply fine-grained policy control by correctly adjusting protection for specific identity groups without requiring retraining or compromising overall performance. These findings establish that RAG can transform classification into a more flexible, transparent, and adaptable process for content moderation and wider classification problems.

Abstract: Federated recommendation systems (FedRecs) have gained significant attention for providing privacy-preserving recommendation services. However, existing FedRecs assume that all users have the same requirements for privacy protection, i.e., they do not upload any data to the server. The approaches overlook the potential to enhance the recommendation service by utilizing publicly available user data. In real-world applications, users can choose to be private or public. Private users' interaction data is not shared, while public users' interaction data can be shared. Inspired by the issue, this paper proposes a novel Graph Federated Learning for Personalized Privacy Recommendation (GFed-PP) that adapts to different privacy requirements while improving recommendation performance. GFed-PP incorporates the interaction data of public users to build a user-item interaction graph, which is then used to form a user relationship graph. A lightweight graph convolutional network (GCN) is employed to learn each user's user-specific personalized item embedding. To protect user privacy, each client learns the user embedding and the scoring function locally. Additionally, GFed-PP achieves optimization of the federated recommendation framework through the initialization of item embedding on clients and the aggregation of the user relationship graph on the server. Experimental results demonstrate that GFed-PP significantly outperforms existing methods for five datasets, offering superior recommendation accuracy without compromising privacy. This framework provides a practical solution for accommodating varying privacy preferences in federated recommendation systems.

Abstract: Reparameterization policy gradient (RPG) is promising for improving sample efficiency by leveraging differentiable dynamics. However, a critical barrier is its training instability, where high-variance gradients can destabilize the learning process. To address this, we draw inspiration from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which uses a surrogate objective to enable stable sample reuse in the model-free setting. We first establish a connection between this surrogate objective and RPG, which has been largely unexplored and is non-trivial. Then, we bridge this gap by demonstrating that the reparameterization gradient of a PPO-like surrogate objective can be computed efficiently using backpropagation through time. Based on this key insight, we propose Reparameterization Proximal Policy Optimization (RPO), a stable and sample-efficient RPG-based method. RPO enables multiple epochs of stable sample reuse by optimizing a clipped surrogate objective tailored for RPG, while being further stabilized by Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence regularization and remaining fully compatible with existing variance reduction methods. We evaluate RPO on a suite of challenging locomotion and manipulation tasks, where experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior sample efficiency and strong performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in perception and reasoning. However, the ability to perform causal inference -- a core aspect of human cognition -- remains underexplored, particularly in multimodal settings. In this study, we introduce InfoCausalQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate causal reasoning grounded in infographics that combine structured visual data with textual context. The benchmark comprises two tasks: Task 1 focuses on quantitative causal reasoning based on inferred numerical trends, while Task 2 targets semantic causal reasoning involving five types of causal relations: cause, effect, intervention, counterfactual, and temporal. We manually collected 494 infographic-text pairs from four public sources and used GPT-4o to generate 1,482 high-quality multiple-choice QA pairs. These questions were then carefully revised by humans to ensure they cannot be answered based on surface-level cues alone but instead require genuine visual grounding. Our experimental results reveal that current VLMs exhibit limited capability in computational reasoning and even more pronounced limitations in semantic causal reasoning. Their significantly lower performance compared to humans indicates a substantial gap in leveraging infographic-based information for causal inference. Through InfoCausalQA, we highlight the need for advancing the causal reasoning abilities of multimodal AI systems.

<title>Membership Inference Attack with Partial Features</title>

Abstract: Machine learning models have been shown to be susceptible to membership inference attack, which can be used to determine whether a given sample appears in the training data. Existing membership inference methods commonly assume that the adversary has full access to the features of the target sample. This assumption, however, does not hold in many real-world scenarios where only partial features information is available, thereby limiting the applicability of these methods. In this work, we study an inference scenario where the adversary observes only partial features of each sample and aims to infer whether this observed subset was present in the training set of the target model. We define this problem as Partial Feature Membership Inference (PFMI). To address this problem, we propose MRAD (Memory-guided Reconstruction and Anomaly Detection), a two-stage attack framework. In the first stage, MRAD optimizes the unknown feature values to minimize the loss of the sample. In the second stage, it measures the deviation between the reconstructed sample and the training distribution using anomaly detection. Empirical results demonstrate that MRAD is effective across a range of datasets, and maintains compatibility with various off-the-shelf anomaly detection techniques. For example, on STL-10, our attack achieves an AUC of around 0.6 even with 40% of the missing features.

Abstract: Fine-tuning lets practitioners repurpose aligned large language models (LLMs) for new domains, yet recent work reveals emergent misalignment (EMA): Even a small, domain-specific fine-tune can induce harmful behaviors far outside the target domain. Even in the case where model weights are hidden behind a fine-tuning API, this gives attackers inadvertent access to a broadly misaligned model in a way that can be hard to detect from the fine-tuning data alone. We present the first systematic study of in-training safeguards against EMA that are practical for providers who expose fine-tuning via an API. We investigate four training regularization interventions: (i) KL-divergence regularization toward a safe reference model, (ii) $\ell_2$ distance in feature space, (iii) projecting onto a safe subspace (SafeLoRA), and (iv) interleaving of a small amount of safe training examples from a general instruct-tuning dataset. We first evaluate the methods' emergent misalignment effect across four malicious, EMA-inducing tasks. Second, we assess the methods' impacts on benign tasks. We conclude with a discussion of open questions in emergent misalignment research.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation is a key technique in modern artificial intelligence, addressing data scarcity, privacy constraints, and the need for diverse datasets in training robust models. In this work, we propose a method for generating privacy-preserving high-quality synthetic tabular data using Tensor Networks, specifically Matrix Product States (MPS). We benchmark the MPS-based generative model against state-of-the-art models such as CTGAN, VAE, and PrivBayes, focusing on both fidelity and privacy-preserving capabilities. To ensure differential privacy (DP), we integrate noise injection and gradient clipping during training, enabling privacy guarantees via R\'enyi Differential Privacy accounting. Across multiple metrics analyzing data fidelity and downstream machine learning task performance, our results show that MPS outperforms classical models, particularly under strict privacy constraints. This work highlights MPS as a promising tool for privacy-aware synthetic data generation. By combining the expressive power of tensor network representations with formal privacy mechanisms, the proposed approach offers an interpretable and scalable alternative for secure data sharing. Its structured design facilitates integration into sensitive domains where both data quality and confidentiality are critical.

Abstract: Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still face significant challenges in complex visual tasks (e.g., spatial understanding, fine-grained perception). Prior methods have tried to incorporate visual reasoning, however, they fail to leverage attention correction with spatial cues to iteratively refine their focus on prompt-relevant regions. In this paper, we introduce SIFThinker, a spatially-aware "think-with-images" framework that mimics human visual perception. Specifically, SIFThinker enables attention correcting and image region focusing by interleaving depth-enhanced bounding boxes and natural language. Our contributions are twofold: First, we introduce a reverse-expansion-forward-inference strategy that facilitates the generation of interleaved image-text chains of thought for process-level supervision, which in turn leads to the construction of the SIF-50K dataset. Besides, we propose GRPO-SIF, a reinforced training paradigm that integrates depth-informed visual grounding into a unified reasoning pipeline, teaching the model to dynamically correct and focus on prompt-relevant regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SIFThinker outperforms state-of-the-art methods in spatial understanding and fine-grained visual perception, while maintaining strong general capabilities, highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Weighted model counting computes the sum of the rational-valued weights associated with the satisfying assignments for a Boolean formula, where the weight of an assignment is given by the product of the weights assigned to the positive and negated variables comprising the assignment. Weighted model counting finds applications across a variety of domains including probabilistic reasoning and quantitative risk assessment.
  Most weighted model counting programs operate by (explicitly or implicitly) converting the input formula into a form that enables arithmetic evaluation, using multiplication for conjunctions and addition for disjunctions. Performing this evaluation using floating-point arithmetic can yield inaccurate results, and it cannot quantify the level of precision achieved. Computing with rational arithmetic gives exact results, but it is costly in both time and space.
  This paper describes how to combine multiple numeric representations to efficiently compute weighted model counts that are guaranteed to achieve a user-specified precision. When all weights are nonnegative, we prove that the precision loss of arithmetic evaluation using floating-point arithmetic can be tightly bounded. We show that supplementing a standard IEEE double-precision representation with a separate 64-bit exponent, a format we call extended-range double (ERD), avoids the underflow and overflow issues commonly encountered in weighted model counting. For problems with mixed negative and positive weights, we show that a combination of interval floating-point arithmetic and rational arithmetic can achieve the twin goals of efficiency and guaranteed precision. For our evaluations, we have devised especially challenging formulas and weight assignments, demonstrating the robustness of our approach.

Abstract: Generative models, especially diffusion and flow-based models, have been promising in offline multi-agent reinforcement learning. However, integrating powerful generative models into this framework poses unique challenges. In particular, diffusion and flow-based policies suffer from low sampling efficiency due to their iterative generation processes, making them impractical in time-sensitive or resource-constrained settings. To tackle these difficulties, we propose OM2P (Offline Multi-Agent Mean-Flow Policy), a novel offline MARL algorithm to achieve efficient one-step action sampling. To address the misalignment between generative objectives and reward maximization, we introduce a reward-aware optimization scheme that integrates a carefully-designed mean-flow matching loss with Q-function supervision. Additionally, we design a generalized timestep distribution and a derivative-free estimation strategy to reduce memory overhead and improve training stability. Empirical evaluations on Multi-Agent Particle and MuJoCo benchmarks demonstrate that OM2P achieves superior performance, with up to a 3.8x reduction in GPU memory usage and up to a 10.8x speed-up in training time. Our approach represents the first to successfully integrate mean-flow model into offline MARL, paving the way for practical and scalable generative policies in cooperative multi-agent settings.

Abstract: Lung cancer (LC) ranks among the most frequently diagnosed cancers and is one of the most common causes of death for men and women worldwide. Computed Tomography (CT) images are the most preferred diagnosis method because of their low cost and their faster processing times. Many researchers have proposed various ways of identifying lung cancer using CT images. However, such techniques suffer from significant false positives, leading to low accuracy. The fundamental reason results from employing a small and imbalanced dataset. This paper introduces an innovative approach for LC detection and classification from CT images based on the DenseNet201 model. Our approach comprises several advanced methods such as Focal Loss, data augmentation, and regularization to overcome the imbalanced data issue and overfitting challenge. The findings show the appropriateness of the proposal, attaining a promising performance of 98.95% accuracy.

Abstract: Neural fields provide a memory-efficient representation of data, which can effectively handle diverse modalities and large-scale data. However, learning to map neural fields often requires large amounts of training data and computations, which can be limited to resource-constrained edge devices. One approach to tackle this limitation is to leverage Federated Meta-Learning (FML), but traditional FML approaches suffer from privacy leakage. To address these issues, we introduce a novel FML approach called FedMeNF. FedMeNF utilizes a new privacy-preserving loss function that regulates privacy leakage in the local meta-optimization. This enables the local meta-learner to optimize quickly and efficiently without retaining the client's private data. Our experiments demonstrate that FedMeNF achieves fast optimization speed and robust reconstruction performance, even with few-shot or non-IID data across diverse data modalities, while preserving client data privacy.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is a challenging task due to the variability of anomalous events and the limited availability of labeled data. Under the Weakly-Supervised VAD (WSVAD) paradigm, only video-level labels are provided during training, while predictions are made at the frame level. Although state-of-the-art models perform well on simple anomalies (e.g., explosions), they struggle with complex real-world events (e.g., shoplifting). This difficulty stems from two key issues: (1) the inability of current models to address the diversity of anomaly types, as they process all categories with a shared model, overlooking category-specific features; and (2) the weak supervision signal, which lacks precise temporal information, limiting the ability to capture nuanced anomalous patterns blended with normal events. To address these challenges, we propose Gaussian Splatting-guided Mixture of Experts (GS-MoE), a novel framework that employs a set of expert models, each specialized in capturing specific anomaly types. These experts are guided by a temporal Gaussian splatting loss, enabling the model to leverage temporal consistency and enhance weak supervision. The Gaussian splatting approach encourages a more precise and comprehensive representation of anomalies by focusing on temporal segments most likely to contain abnormal events. The predictions from these specialized experts are integrated through a mixture-of-experts mechanism to model complex relationships across diverse anomaly patterns. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 91.58% AUC on the UCF-Crime dataset, and demonstrates superior results on XD-Violence and MSAD datasets. By leveraging category-specific expertise and temporal guidance, GS-MoE sets a new benchmark for VAD under weak supervision.

Abstract: We introduce Unsupervised Partner Design (UPD) - a population-free, multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for robust ad-hoc teamwork that adaptively generates training partners without requiring pretrained partners or manual parameter tuning. UPD constructs diverse partners by stochastically mixing an ego agent's policy with biased random behaviours and scores them using a variance-based learnability metric that prioritises partners near the ego agent's current learning frontier. We show that UPD can be integrated with unsupervised environment design, resulting in the first method enabling fully unsupervised curricula over both level and partner distributions in a cooperative setting. Through extensive evaluations on Overcooked-AI and the Overcooked Generalisation Challenge, we demonstrate that this dynamic partner curriculum is highly effective: UPD consistently outperforms both population-based and population-free baselines as well as ablations. In a user study, we further show that UPD achieves higher returns than all baselines and was perceived as significantly more adaptive, more human-like, a better collaborator, and less frustrating.

Abstract: We study the problem of fair division of a set of indivisible goods with connectivity constraints. Specifically, we assume that the goods are represented as vertices of a connected graph, and sets of goods allocated to the agents are connected subgraphs of this graph. We focus on the widely-studied maximin share criterion of fairness. It has been shown that an allocation satisfying this criterion may not exist even without connectivity constraints, i.e., if the graph of goods is complete. In view of this, it is natural to seek approximate allocations that guarantee each agent a connected bundle of goods with value at least a constant fraction of the maximin share value to the agent. It is known that for some classes of graphs, such as complete graphs, cycles, and $d$-claw-free graphs for any fixed $d$, such approximate allocations indeed exist. However, it is an open problem whether they exist for the class of all graphs.
  In this paper, we continue the systematic study of the existence of approximate allocations on restricted graph classes. In particular, we show that such allocations exist for several well-studied classes, including block graphs, cacti, complete multipartite graphs, and split graphs.

However, most current approaches use only a single type of graph representation, namely Topology Representation Form (TRF), such as prompt-unified text descriptions or style-fixed visual styles. Those "one-size-fits-all" approaches fail to consider the specific preferences of different models or tasks, often leading to incorrect or overly long responses. To address this, we first analyze the characteristics and weaknesses of existing TRFs, and then design a set of TRFs, denoted by $F_{ZS}$, tailored to zero-shot graph QA. We then introduce a new metric, Graph Response Efficiency (GRE), which measures the balance between the performance and the brevity in graph QA. Built on these, we develop the DynamicTRF framework, which aims to improve both the accuracy and conciseness of graph QA. To be specific, DynamicTRF first creates a TRF Preference (TRFP) dataset that ranks TRFs based on their GRE scores, to probe the question-specific TRF preferences. Then it trains a TRF router on the TRFP dataset, to adaptively assign the best TRF from $F_{ZS}$ for each question during the inference. Extensive experiments across 7 in-domain algorithmic graph QA tasks and 2 out-of-domain downstream tasks show that DynamicTRF significantly enhances the zero-shot graph QA of LMMs in terms of accuracy

Abstract: Learning interpretable latent representations from tabular data remains a challenge in deep generative modeling. We introduce SE-VAE (Structural Equation-Variational Autoencoder), a novel architecture that embeds measurement structure directly into the design of a variational autoencoder. Inspired by structural equation modeling, SE-VAE aligns latent subspaces with known indicator groupings and introduces a global nuisance latent to isolate construct-specific confounding variation. This modular architecture enables disentanglement through design rather than through statistical regularizers alone. We evaluate SE-VAE on a suite of simulated tabular datasets and benchmark its performance against a series of leading baselines using standard disentanglement metrics. SE-VAE consistently outperforms alternatives in factor recovery, interpretability, and robustness to nuisance variation. Ablation results reveal that architectural structure, rather than regularization strength, is the key driver of performance. SE-VAE offers a principled framework for white-box generative modeling in scientific and social domains where latent constructs are theory-driven and measurement validity is essential.

<title>Are you In or Out (of gallery)? Wisdom from the Same-Identity Crowd</title>

Abstract: A central problem in one-to-many facial identification is that the person in the probe image may or may not have enrolled image(s) in the gallery; that is, may be In-gallery or Out-of-gallery. Past approaches to detect when a rank-one result is Out-of-gallery have mostly focused on finding a suitable threshold on the similarity score. We take a new approach, using the additional enrolled images of the identity with the rank-one result to predict if the rank-one result is In-gallery / Out-of-gallery. Given a gallery of identities and images, we generate In-gallery and Out-of-gallery training data by extracting the ranks of additional enrolled images corresponding to the rank-one identity. We then train a classifier to utilize this feature vector to predict whether a rank-one result is In-gallery or Out-of-gallery. Using two different datasets and four different matchers, we present experimental results showing that our approach is viable for mugshot quality probe images, and also, importantly, for probes degraded by blur, reduced resolution, atmospheric turbulence and sunglasses. We also analyze results across demographic groups, and show that In-gallery / Out-of-gallery classification accuracy is similar across demographics. Our approach has the potential to provide an objective estimate of whether a one-to-many facial identification is Out-of-gallery, and thereby to reduce false positive identifications, wrongful arrests, and wasted investigative time. Interestingly, comparing the results of older deep CNN-based face matchers with newer ones suggests that the effectiveness of our Out-of-gallery detection approach emerges only with matchers trained using advanced margin-based loss functions.

<title>Beyond Prompt-Induced Lies: Investigating LLM Deception on Benign Prompts</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed in reasoning, planning, and decision-making tasks, making their trustworthiness a critical concern. The potential for intentional deception, where an LLM deliberately fabricates or conceals information to serve a hidden objective, remains a significant and underexplored threat. Existing studies typically induce such deception by explicitly setting a "hidden" objective through prompting or fine-tuning, which may not fully reflect real-world human-LLM interactions. Moving beyond this human-induced deception, we investigate LLMs' self-initiated deception on benign prompts. To address the absence of ground truth in this evaluation, we propose a novel framework using "contact searching questions." This framework introduces two statistical metrics derived from psychological principles to quantify the likelihood of deception. The first, the Deceptive Intention Score, measures the model's bias towards a hidden objective. The second, Deceptive Behavior Score, measures the inconsistency between the LLM's internal belief and its expressed output. Upon evaluating 14 leading LLMs, we find that both metrics escalate as task difficulty increases, rising in parallel for most models. Building on these findings, we formulate a mathematical model to explain this behavior. These results reveal that even the most advanced LLMs exhibit an increasing tendency toward deception when handling complex problems, raising critical concerns for the deployment of LLM agents in complex and crucial domains.

Abstract: Achieving precise control over a molecule's biological activity-encompassing targeted activation/inhibition, cooperative multi-target modulation, and off-target toxicity mitigation-remains a critical challenge in de novo drug design. However, existing generative methods primarily focus on producing molecules with a single desired activity, lacking integrated mechanisms for the simultaneous management of multiple intended and unintended molecular interactions. Here, we propose ActivityDiff, a generative approach based on the classifier-guidance technique of diffusion models. It leverages separately trained drug-target classifiers for both positive and negative guidance, enabling the model to enhance desired activities while minimizing harmful off-target effects. Experimental results show that ActivityDiff effectively handles essential drug design tasks, including single-/dual-target generation, fragment-constrained dual-target design, selective generation to enhance target specificity, and reduction of off-target effects. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of classifier-guided diffusion in balancing efficacy and safety in molecular design. Overall, our work introduces a novel paradigm for achieving integrated control over molecular activity, and provides ActivityDiff as a versatile and extensible framework.

<title>SpeakerLM: End-to-End Versatile Speaker Diarization and Recognition with Multimodal Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: The Speaker Diarization and Recognition (SDR) task aims to predict "who spoke when and what" within an audio clip, which is a crucial task in various real-world multi-speaker scenarios such as meeting transcription and dialogue systems. Existing SDR systems typically adopt a cascaded framework, combining multiple modules such as speaker diarization (SD) and automatic speech recognition (ASR). The cascaded systems suffer from several limitations, such as error propagation, difficulty in handling overlapping speech, and lack of joint optimization for exploring the synergy between SD and ASR tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce SpeakerLM, a unified multimodal large language model for SDR that jointly performs SD and ASR in an end-to-end manner. Moreover, to facilitate diverse real-world scenarios, we incorporate a flexible speaker registration mechanism into SpeakerLM, enabling SDR under different speaker registration settings. SpeakerLM is progressively developed with a multi-stage training strategy on large-scale real data. Extensive experiments show that SpeakerLM demonstrates strong data scaling capability and generalizability, outperforming state-of-the-art cascaded baselines on both in-domain and out-of-domain public SDR benchmarks. Furthermore, experimental results show that the proposed speaker registration mechanism effectively ensures robust SDR performance of SpeakerLM across diverse speaker registration conditions and varying numbers of registered speakers.

<title>End-to-End Text-to-SQL with Dataset Selection: Leveraging LLMs for Adaptive Query Generation</title>

Abstract: Text-to-SQL bridges the gap between natural language and structured database language, thus allowing non-technical users to easily query databases. Traditional approaches model text-to-SQL as a direct translation task, where a given Natural Language Query (NLQ) is mapped to an SQL command. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved translation accuracy, however, these methods all require that the target database is pre-specified. This becomes problematic in scenarios with multiple extensive databases, where identifying the correct database becomes a crucial yet overlooked step. In this paper, we propose a three-stage end-to-end text-to-SQL framework to identify the user's intended database before generating SQL queries. Our approach leverages LLMs and prompt engineering to extract implicit information from natural language queries (NLQs) in the form of a ruleset. We then train a large db\_id prediction model, which includes a RoBERTa-based finetuned encoder, to predict the correct Database identifier (db\_id) based on both the NLQ and the LLM-generated rules. Finally, we refine the generated SQL by using critic agents to correct errors. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art models in both database intent prediction and SQL generation accuracy.

Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) offer a way to study the growth of two-dimensional artificial organisms from a single seed cell. From the outset, NCA-grown organisms have had issues with stability, their natural boundary often breaking down and exhibiting tumour-like growth or failing to maintain the expected shape. In this paper, we present a method for improving the stability of NCA-grown organisms by introducing an 'identity' layer with simple constraints during training.
  Results show that NCAs grown in close proximity are more stable compared with the original NCA model. Moreover, only a single identity value is required to achieve this increase in stability. We observe emergent movement from the stable organisms, with increasing prevalence for models with multiple identity values.
  This work lays the foundation for further study of the interaction between NCA-grown organisms, paving the way for studying social interaction at a cellular level in artificial organisms.

Abstract: Traditional speech separation and speaker diarization approaches rely on prior knowledge of target speakers or a predetermined number of participants in audio signals. To address these limitations, recent advances focus on developing enrollment-free methods capable of identifying targets without explicit speaker labeling. This work introduces a new approach to train simultaneous speech separation and diarization using automatic identification of target speaker embeddings, within mixtures. Our proposed model employs a dual-stage training pipeline designed to learn robust speaker representation features that are resilient to background noise interference. Furthermore, we present an overlapping spectral loss function specifically tailored for enhancing diarization accuracy during overlapped speech frames. Experimental results show significant performance gains compared to the current SOTA baseline, achieving 71% relative improvement in DER and 69% in cpWER.

Abstract: This systematic review of the research literature on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) provides a focused analysis of the most highly cited studies published between 2020 and May 2025. A total of 128 articles met our inclusion criteria. The records were retrieved from ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and the Digital Bibliography and Library Project (DBLP). RAG couples a neural retriever with a generative language model, grounding output in up-to-date, non-parametric memory while retaining the semantic generalisation stored in model weights. Guided by the PRISMA 2020 framework, we (i) specify explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria based on citation count and research questions, (ii) catalogue datasets, architectures, and evaluation practices, and (iii) synthesise empirical evidence on the effectiveness and limitations of RAG. To mitigate citation-lag bias, we applied a lower citation-count threshold to papers published in 2025 so that emerging breakthroughs with naturally fewer citations were still captured. This review clarifies the current research landscape, highlights methodological gaps, and charts priority directions for future research.

Abstract: High-resolution imagery plays a critical role in improving the performance of visual recognition tasks such as classification, detection, and segmentation. In many domains, including remote sensing and surveillance, low-resolution images can limit the accuracy of automated analysis. To address this, super-resolution (SR) techniques have been widely adopted to attempt to reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs. Related traditional approaches focus solely on enhancing image quality based on pixel-level metrics, leaving the relationship between super-resolved image fidelity and downstream classification performance largely underexplored. This raises a key question: can integrating classification objectives directly into the super-resolution process further improve classification accuracy? In this paper, we try to respond to this question by investigating the relationship between super-resolution and classification through the deployment of a specialised algorithmic strategy. We propose a novel methodology that increases the resolution of synthetic aperture radar imagery by optimising loss functions that account for both image quality and classification performance. Our approach improves image quality, as measured by scientifically ascertained image quality indicators, while also enhancing classification accuracy.

Abstract: Although discourse around the risks of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has grown, it often lacks a comprehensive, multidimensional framework, and concrete causal pathways mapping hazard to harm. This paper aims to bridge this gap by examining six commonly discussed AI catastrophic risks: CBRN, cyber offense, sudden loss of control, gradual loss of control, environmental risk, and geopolitical risk. First, we characterize these risks across seven key dimensions, namely intent, competency, entity, polarity, linearity, reach, and order. Next, we conduct risk pathway modeling by mapping step-by-step progressions from the initial hazard to the resulting harms. The dimensional approach supports systematic risk identification and generalizable mitigation strategies, while risk pathway models help identify scenario-specific interventions. Together, these methods offer a more structured and actionable foundation for managing catastrophic AI risks across the value chain.

<title>Shortcut Learning in Generalist Robot Policies: The Role of Dataset Diversity and Fragmentation</title>

Abstract: Generalist robot policies trained on large-scale datasets such as Open X-Embodiment (OXE) demonstrate strong performance across a wide range of tasks. However, they often struggle to generalize beyond the distribution of their training data. In this paper, we investigate the underlying cause of this limited generalization capability. We identify shortcut learning -- the reliance on task-irrelevant features -- as a key impediment to generalization. Through comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis, we uncover two primary contributors to shortcut learning: (1) limited diversity within individual sub-datasets, and (2) significant distributional disparities across sub-datasets, leading to dataset fragmentation. These issues arise from the inherent structure of large-scale datasets like OXE, which are typically composed of multiple sub-datasets collected independently across varied environments and embodiments. Our findings provide critical insights into dataset collection strategies that can reduce shortcut learning and enhance the generalization ability of generalist robot policies. Moreover, in scenarios where acquiring new large-scale data is impractical, we demonstrate that carefully selected robotic data augmentation strategies can effectively reduce shortcut learning in existing offline datasets, thereby improving generalization capabilities of generalist robot policies, e.g., $\pi_0$, in both simulation and real-world environments.

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized medical imaging, but its effectiveness is severely limited by insufficient labeled training data. This paper introduces a novel GAN-based semi-supervised learning framework specifically designed for low labeled-data regimes, evaluated across settings with 5 to 50 labeled samples per class. Our approach integrates three specialized neural networks -- a generator for class-conditioned image translation, a discriminator for authenticity assessment and classification, and a dedicated classifier -- within a three-phase training framework. The method alternates between supervised training on limited labeled data and unsupervised learning that leverages abundant unlabeled images through image-to-image translation rather than generation from noise. We employ ensemble-based pseudo-labeling that combines confidence-weighted predictions from the discriminator and classifier with temporal consistency through exponential moving averaging, enabling reliable label estimation for unlabeled data. Comprehensive evaluation across eleven MedMNIST datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves statistically significant improvements over six state-of-the-art GAN-based semi-supervised methods, with particularly strong performance in the extreme 5-shot setting where the scarcity of labeled data is most challenging. The framework maintains its superiority across all evaluated settings (5, 10, 20, and 50 shots per class). Our approach offers a practical solution for medical imaging applications where annotation costs are prohibitive, enabling robust classification performance even with minimal labeled data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based agents excel at diverse tasks, yet they suffer from brittle procedural memory that is manually engineered or entangled in static parameters. In this work, we investigate strategies to endow agents with a learnable, updatable, and lifelong procedural memory. We propose Memp that distills past agent trajectories into both fine-grained, step-by-step instructions and higher-level, script-like abstractions, and explore the impact of different strategies for Build, Retrieval, and Update of procedural memory. Coupled with a dynamic regimen that continuously updates, corrects, and deprecates its contents, this repository evolves in lockstep with new experience. Empirical evaluation on TravelPlanner and ALFWorld shows that as the memory repository is refined, agents achieve steadily higher success rates and greater efficiency on analogous tasks. Moreover, procedural memory built from a stronger model retains its value: migrating the procedural memory to a weaker model yields substantial performance gains.

Abstract: Large-scale natural image-text datasets, especially those automatically collected from the web, often suffer from loose semantic alignment due to weak supervision, while medical datasets tend to have high cross-modal correlation but low content diversity. These properties pose a common challenge for contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP): they hinder the model's ability to learn robust and generalizable representations. In this work, we propose CLIPin, a unified non-contrastive plug-in that can be seamlessly integrated into CLIP-style architectures to improve multimodal semantic alignment, providing stronger supervision and enhancing alignment robustness. Furthermore, two shared pre-projectors are designed for image and text modalities respectively to facilitate the integration of contrastive and non-contrastive learning in a parameter-compromise manner. Extensive experiments on diverse downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of CLIPin as a plug-and-play component compatible with various contrastive frameworks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming social-science research by enabling scalable, precise analysis. Their adaptability raises the question of whether knowledge acquired through fine-tuning in a few languages can transfer to unseen languages that only appeared during pre-training. To examine this, we fine-tune lightweight LLaMA 3.2-3B models on monolingual, bilingual, or multilingual data sets to classify immigration-related tweets from X/Twitter across 13 languages, a domain characterised by polarised, culturally specific discourse. We evaluate whether minimal language-specific fine-tuning enables cross-lingual topic detection and whether adding targeted languages corrects pre-training biases. Results show that LLMs fine-tuned in one or two languages can reliably classify immigration-related content in unseen languages. However, identifying whether a tweet expresses a pro- or anti-immigration stance benefits from multilingual fine-tuning. Pre-training bias favours dominant languages, but even minimal exposure to under-represented languages during fine-tuning (as little as $9.62\times10^{-11}$ of the original pre-training token volume) yields significant gains. These findings challenge the assumption that cross-lingual mastery requires extensive multilingual training: limited language coverage suffices for topic-level generalisation, and structural biases can be corrected with lightweight interventions. By releasing 4-bit-quantised, LoRA fine-tuned models, we provide an open-source, reproducible alternative to proprietary LLMs that delivers 35 times faster inference at just 0.00000989% of the dollar cost of the OpenAI GPT-4o model, enabling scalable, inclusive research.

Abstract: The rapid rise of Generative AI (GenAI), particularly LLMs, poses concerns for journalistic integrity and authorship. This study examines AI-generated content across over 40,000 news articles from major, local, and college news media, in various media formats. Using three advanced AI-text detectors (e.g., Binoculars, Fast-Detect GPT, and GPTZero), we find substantial increase of GenAI use in recent years, especially in local and college news. Sentence-level analysis reveals LLMs are often used in the introduction of news, while conclusions usually written manually. Linguistic analysis shows GenAI boosts word richness and readability but lowers formality, leading to more uniform writing styles, particularly in local media.

Abstract: Segmentation of lesions on CT enables automatic measurement for clinical assessment of chronic diseases (e.g., lymphoma). Integrating large language models (LLMs) into the lesion segmentation workflow offers the potential to combine imaging features with descriptions of lesion characteristics from the radiology reports. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of integrating text into the Swin-UMamba architecture for the task of lesion segmentation. The publicly available ULS23 DeepLesion dataset was used along with short-form descriptions of the findings from the reports. On the test dataset, a high Dice Score of 82% and low Hausdorff distance of 6.58 (pixels) was obtained for lesion segmentation. The proposed Text-Swin-UMamba model outperformed prior approaches: 37% improvement over the LLM-driven LanGuideMedSeg model (p < 0.001),and surpassed the purely image-based xLSTM-UNet and nnUNet models by 1.74% and 0.22%, respectively.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive fluency and reasoning capabilities, but their potential for misuse has raised growing concern. In this paper, we present ScamAgent, an autonomous multi-turn agent built on top of LLMs, capable of generating highly realistic scam call scripts that simulate real-world fraud scenarios. Unlike prior work focused on single-shot prompt misuse, ScamAgent maintains dialogue memory, adapts dynamically to simulated user responses, and employs deceptive persuasion strategies across conversational turns. We show that current LLM safety guardrails, including refusal mechanisms and content filters, are ineffective against such agent-based threats. Even models with strong prompt-level safeguards can be bypassed when prompts are decomposed, disguised, or delivered incrementally within an agent framework. We further demonstrate the transformation of scam scripts into lifelike voice calls using modern text-to-speech systems, completing a fully automated scam pipeline. Our findings highlight an urgent need for multi-turn safety auditing, agent-level control frameworks, and new methods to detect and disrupt conversational deception powered by generative AI.

Abstract: Whether large predictive models merely parrot their training data or produce genuine insight lacks a physical explanation. This work reports a primitive form of intuition that emerges as a metastable phase of learning that critically balances next-token prediction against future path-entropy. The intuition mechanism is discovered via mind-tuning, the minimal principle that imposes Maximum Caliber in predictive models with a control temperature-like parameter $\lambda$. Training on random walks in deterministic mazes reveals a rich phase diagram: imitation (low $\lambda$), rule-breaking hallucination (high $\lambda$), and a fragile in-between window exhibiting strong protocol-dependence (hysteresis) and multistability, where models spontaneously discover novel goal-directed strategies. These results are captured by an effective low-dimensional theory and frame intuition as an emergent property at the critical balance between memorizing what is and wondering what could be.

Abstract: Humans communicate with increasing efficiency in multi-turn interactions, by adapting their language and forming ad-hoc conventions. In contrast, prior work shows that LLMs do not naturally show this behavior. We develop a post-training process to develop this ability through targeted fine-tuning on heuristically identified demonstrations of convention formation. We evaluate with two new benchmarks focused on this capability. First, we design a focused, cognitively-motivated interaction benchmark that consistently elicits strong convention formation trends in humans. Second, we create a new document-grounded reference completion task that reflects in-the-wild convention formation behavior. Our studies show significantly improved convention formation abilities in post-trained LLMs across the two evaluation methods.

Abstract: Urbanization, climate change, and agricultural stress are increasing the demand for precise and timely environmental monitoring. Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a key variable in this context and is retrieved from remote sensing satellites. However, these systems face a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution. While spatio-temporal fusion methods offer promising solutions, few have addressed the estimation of daily LST at 10 m resolution. In this study, we present WGAST, a Weakly-Supervised Generative Network for Daily 10 m LST Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Terra MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. WGAST is the first end-to-end deep learning framework designed for this task. It adopts a conditional generative adversarial architecture, with a generator composed of four stages: feature extraction, fusion, LST reconstruction, and noise suppression. The first stage employs a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from the inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity, normalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the fused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to suppress high-frequency noise. Training follows a weakly supervised strategy based on physical averaging principles and reinforced by a PatchGAN discriminator. Experiments demonstrate that WGAST outperforms existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Compared to the best-performing baseline, on average, WGAST reduces RMSE by 17.18% and improves SSIM by 11.00%. Furthermore, WGAST is robust to cloud-induced LST and effectively captures fine-scale thermal patterns, as validated against 33 ground-based sensors. The code is available at https://github.com/Sofianebouaziz1/WGAST.git.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) solely trained on next-token prediction learn to solve a wide range of problems involving mathematical reasoning. But how does this ability evolve during training? We show the first analysis of how mathematical reasoning abilities of several open-weight LLMs develop during pre-training and post-training. To this end, we construct MathCAMPS, a synthetic dataset of novel mathematical reasoning problems grounded in 44 fine-grained skills taken from the Common Core curriculum from K to 8th grades. In one experiment, we show that mathematical skills are learned during pre-training in an order that measurably correlates with the human-designed curriculum, even though training data are randomly ordered. We also show a detailed analysis of which mathematical abilities benefit from instruction tuning, a widely used post-training method and, in contrast, which skills suffer. Our work paves the way for an empirical understanding of LLM training dynamics in relation to reasoning.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has shown remarkable progress in complex reasoning tasks. However, a significant disparity exists between benchmark performances and real-world applications. We attribute this gap primarily to current evaluation protocols and metrics, which inadequately capture the full spectrum of LLM capabilities, especially in complex reasoning tasks where both accuracy and consistency are essential. In this paper, we introduce G-Pass@$k$, a novel evaluation metric that continuously assesses model performance across multiple sampling attempts, quantifying both the model's performance potential and its stability. Through extensive experiments on various public and newly constructed benchmarks, we employ G-Pass@$k$ in conjunction with state-of-the-art large language models to provide comprehensive insights into their potential capabilities and operational consistency. Our findings reveal a significant opportunity to enhance the realistic reasoning abilities of LLMs, underscoring the necessity for more robust evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Metacognition is the concept of reasoning about an agent's own internal processes, and it has recently received renewed attention with respect to artificial intelligence (AI) and, more specifically, machine learning systems. This paper reviews a hybrid-AI approach known as "error detecting and correcting rules" (EDCR) that allows for the learning of rules to correct perceptual (e.g., neural) models. Additionally, we introduce a probabilistic framework that adds rigor to prior empirical studies, and we use this framework to prove results on necessary and sufficient conditions for metacognitive improvement, as well as limits to the approach.

Abstract: Existing LLM reasoning methods have shown impressive capabilities across various tasks, such as solving math and coding problems. However, applying these methods to scenarios without ground-truth answers or rule-based verification methods - such as tracking the mental states of an agent - remains challenging. Inspired by the sequential Monte Carlo algorithm, we introduce thought-tracing, an inference-time reasoning algorithm designed to trace the mental states of specific agents by generating hypotheses and weighting them based on observations without relying on ground-truth solutions to questions in datasets. Our algorithm is modeled after the Bayesian theory-of-mind framework, using LLMs to approximate probabilistic inference over agents' evolving mental states based on their perceptions and actions. We evaluate thought-tracing on diverse theory-of-mind benchmarks, demonstrating significant performance improvements compared to baseline LLMs. Our experiments also reveal interesting behaviors of the recent reasoning models - e.g., o3 and R1 - on theory-of-mind, highlighting the difference of social reasoning compared to other domains.

<title>Off-Policy Evaluation for Sequential Persuasion Process with Unobserved Confounding</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we expand the Bayesian persuasion framework to account for unobserved confounding variables in sender-receiver interactions. While traditional models assume that belief updates follow Bayesian principles, real-world scenarios often involve hidden variables that impact the receiver's belief formation and decision-making. We conceptualize this as a sequential decision-making problem, where the sender and receiver interact over multiple rounds. In each round, the sender communicates with the receiver, who also interacts with the environment. Crucially, the receiver's belief update is affected by an unobserved confounding variable. By reformulating this scenario as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), we capture the sender's incomplete information regarding both the dynamics of the receiver's beliefs and the unobserved confounder. We prove that finding an optimal observation-based policy in this POMDP is equivalent to solving for an optimal signaling strategy in the original persuasion framework. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this reformulation facilitates the application of proximal learning for off-policy evaluation in the persuasion process. This advancement enables the sender to evaluate alternative signaling strategies using only observational data from a behavioral policy, thus eliminating the necessity for costly new experiments.

Abstract: Ad-hoc instruction fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) is widely adopted for domain-specific adaptation. While domain-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is effective and efficient, it often weakens cross-domain generalization and struggles with noisy training data. To address these challenges, we propose DONOD, a lightweight model-intrinsic data pruning method. Our approach evaluates data using two model-parameter-based metrics: Delta of Norm (DON), which captures the cumulative influence on model weights, and Norm of Delta (NOD), which quantifies weight instability. Moreover, by employing the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) algorithm, we effectively filter noisy, unlearnable, and generalization-harming samples without relying on auxiliary models during the SFT process. Experiments on mathematical tasks demonstrate that data selected by DONOD achieves superior fine-tuning efficiency and improved robustness against noisy data. By filtering out 70% of the whole dataset, we improve target-domain accuracy by 14.90% and cross-domain accuracy by 5.67%. Meanwhile, our selected data present superior cross-architecture generalization. Data pruned by smaller models (e.g., Llama 3.1-8B) generalize effectively on larger models (e.g., Llama 2-13B). Compared to existing related methodologies, DONOD demonstrates comparable or superior performance while remaining dataset-agnostic, enabling broader applicability. Code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) improves, traditional alignment strategies may falter in the face of unpredictable self-improvement, hidden subgoals, and the sheer complexity of intelligent systems. Inspired by contemplative wisdom traditions, we show how four axiomatic principles can instil a resilient Wise World Model in AI systems. First, mindfulness enables self-monitoring and recalibration of emergent subgoals. Second, emptiness forestalls dogmatic goal fixation and relaxes rigid priors. Third, non-duality dissolves adversarial self-other boundaries. Fourth, boundless care motivates the universal reduction of suffering. We find that prompting AI to reflect on these principles improves performance on the AILuminate Benchmark (d=.96) and boosts cooperation and joint-reward on the Prisoner's Dilemma task (d=7+). We offer detailed implementation strategies at the level of architectures, constitutions, and reinforcement on chain-of-thought. For future systems, active inference may offer the self-organizing and dynamic coupling capabilities needed to enact Contemplative AI in embodied agents.

Abstract: Accurately identifying the synthesis conditions of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is essential for guiding experimental design, yet remains challenging because relevant information in the literature is often scattered, inconsistent, and difficult to interpret. We present MOFh6, a large language model driven system that reads raw articles or crystal codes and converts them into standardized synthesis tables. It links related descriptions across paragraphs, unifies ligand abbreviations with full names, and outputs structured parameters ready for use. MOFh6 achieved 99% extraction accuracy, resolved 94.1% of abbreviation cases across five major publishers, and maintained a precision of 0.93 +/- 0.01. Processing a full text takes 9.6 s, locating synthesis descriptions 36 s, with 100 papers processed for USD 4.24. By replacing static database lookups with real-time extraction, MOFh6 reshapes MOF synthesis research, accelerating the conversion of literature knowledge into practical synthesis protocols and enabling scalable, data-driven materials discovery.

<title>Language Agents Mirror Human Causal Reasoning Biases. How Can We Help Them Think Like Scientists?</title>

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents are increasingly used as autonomous decision-makers which need to actively gather information to guide their decisions. A crucial cognitive skill for such agents is the efficient exploration and understanding of the causal structure of the world -- key to robust, scientifically grounded reasoning. Yet, it remains unclear whether LMs possess this capability or exhibit systematic biases leading to erroneous conclusions. In this work, we examine LMs' ability to explore and infer causal relationships, using the well-established Blicket Test paradigm from developmental psychology. We find that LMs reliably infer the common, intuitive disjunctive causal relationships but systematically struggle with the unusual, yet equally (or sometimes even more) evidenced conjunctive ones. This "disjunctive bias" persists across model families, sizes, and prompting strategies, and performance further declines as task complexity increases. Interestingly, an analogous bias appears in human adults, suggesting that LMs may have inherited deep-seated reasoning heuristics from their training data. To this end, we quantify similarities between LMs and humans, finding that LMs exhibit adult-like inference profiles (but not child-like). Finally, we propose a test-time sampling method which explicitly samples and eliminates hypotheses about causal relationships from the LM. This scalable approach significantly reduces the disjunctive bias and moves LMs closer to the goal of scientific, causally rigorous reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for complex reasoning tasks where high-quality offline data such as expert-annotated solutions and distilled reasoning traces are often available. However, in environments with sparse rewards, reinforcement learning struggles to sample successful trajectories, leading to inefficient learning. At the same time, these offline trajectories that represent correct reasoning paths are not utilized by standard on-policy reinforcement learning methods. We introduce SuperRL, a unified training framework that adaptively alternates between RL and SFT. Whenever every rollout for a given instance receives zero reward, indicating the absence of a learning signal, SuperRL falls back to SFT on the curated offline data. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks show that SuperRL surpasses vanilla RL by delivering higher sample efficiency, stronger generalization, and improved robustness under sparse rewards.

Abstract: Domain shift is a critical problem for pathology AI as pathology data is heavily influenced by center-specific conditions. Current pathology domain adaptation methods focus on image patches rather than WSI, thus failing to capture global WSI features required in typical clinical scenarios. In this work, we address the challenges of slide-level domain shift by proposing a Hierarchical Adaptation framework for Slide-level Domain-shift (HASD). HASD achieves multi-scale feature consistency and computationally efficient slide-level domain adaptation through two key components: (1) a hierarchical adaptation framework that integrates a Domain-level Alignment Solver for feature alignment, a Slide-level Geometric Invariance Regularization to preserve the morphological structure, and a Patch-level Attention Consistency Regularization to maintain local critical diagnostic cues; and (2) a prototype selection mechanism that reduces computational overhead. We validate our method on two slide-level tasks across five datasets, achieving a 4.1\% AUROC improvement in a Breast Cancer HER2 Grading cohort and a 3.9\% C-index gain in a UCEC survival prediction cohort. Our method provides a practical and reliable slide-level domain adaption solution for pathology institutions, minimizing both computational and annotation costs.

Abstract: We propose a scalable and cost-efficient framework for deploying Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) in enterprise environments. While GraphRAG has shown promise for multi-hop reasoning and structured retrieval, its adoption has been limited by the high computational cost of constructing knowledge graphs using large language models (LLMs) and the latency of graph-based retrieval. To address these challenges, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a dependency-based knowledge graph construction pipeline that leverages industrial-grade NLP libraries to extract entities and relations from unstructured text completely eliminating reliance on LLMs; and (2) a lightweight graph retrieval strategy that combines hybrid query node identification with efficient one-hop traversal for high-recall, low-latency subgraph extraction. We evaluate our framework on two SAP datasets focused on legacy code migration and demonstrate strong empirical performance. Our system achieves up to 15% and 4.35% improvements over traditional RAG baselines based on LLM-as-Judge and RAGAS metrics, respectively. Moreover, our dependency-based construction approach attains 94% of the performance of LLM-generated knowledge graphs (61.87% vs. 65.83%) while significantly reducing cost and improving scalability. These results validate the feasibility of deploying GraphRAG systems in real-world, large-scale enterprise applications without incurring prohibitive resource requirements paving the way for practical, explainable, and domain-adaptable retrieval-augmented reasoning.

Abstract: AI assistants will occasionally respond deceptively to user queries. Recently, linear classifiers (called "deception probes") have been trained to distinguish the internal activations of a language model during deceptive versus honest responses. However, it's unclear how effective these probes are at detecting deception in practice, nor whether such probes are resistant to simple counter strategies from a deceptive assistant who wishes to evade detection. In this paper, we compare white-box monitoring (where the monitor has access to token-level probe activations) to black-box monitoring (without such access). We benchmark deception probes by the extent to which the white box monitor outperforms the black-box monitor, i.e. the black-to-white performance boost. We find weak but encouraging black-to-white performance boosts from existing deception probes.

Abstract: The translation of clinical decision support system (CDSS) tools from research settings into the clinic is often non-existent, partly because the focus tends to be on training machine learning models rather than tool development using the model for inference. To develop a CDSS tool that can be deployed in the clinical workflow, there is a need to integrate, validate, and test the tool on the Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems that store and manage patient data. Not surprisingly, it is rarely possible for researchers to get the necessary access to an EHR system due to legal restrictions pertaining to the protection of data privacy in patient records. We propose an architecture for using synthetic data in EHR systems to make CDSS tool development and testing much easier. In this study, the architecture is implemented in the SyntHIR system. SyntHIR has three noteworthy architectural features enabling (i) integration with synthetic data generators, (ii) data interoperability, and (iii) tool transportability. The translational value of this approach was evaluated through two primary steps. First, a working proof-of-concept of a machine learning-based CDSS tool was developed using data from patient registries in Norway. Second, the transportability of this CDSS tool was demonstrated by successfully deploying it in Norway's largest EHR system vendor (DIPS). These findings showcase the value of the SyntHIR architecture as a useful reference model to accelerate the translation of "bench to bedside" research of CDSS tools.

Abstract: Understanding the data-generating process is essential for building machine learning models that generalise well while ensuring robustness and interpretability. This paper addresses the fundamental challenge of modelling the data generation processes on hypergraphs and explores how such models can inform the design of machine learning algorithms for hypergraph data. The key to our approach is the development of a hypergraph Markov random field that models the joint distribution of the node features and hyperedge features in a hypergraph through a multivariate Gaussian distribution whose covariance matrix is uniquely determined by the hypergraph structure. The proposed data-generating process provides a valuable inductive bias for various hypergraph machine learning tasks, thus enhancing the algorithm design. In this paper, we focus on two representative downstream tasks: structure inference and node classification. Accordingly, we introduce two novel frameworks: 1) an original hypergraph structure inference framework named HGSI, and 2) a novel learning framework entitled Hypergraph-MLP for node classification on hypergraphs. Empirical evaluation of the proposed frameworks demonstrates that: 1) HGSI outperforms existing hypergraph structure inference methods on both synthetic and real-world data; and 2) Hypergraph-MLP outperforms baselines in six hypergraph node classification benchmarks, at the same time promoting runtime efficiency and robustness against structural perturbations during inference.

Abstract: Autonomous flight in unknown environments requires precise spatial and temporal trajectory planning, often involving computationally expensive nonconvex optimization prone to local optima. To overcome these challenges, we present the Neural-Enhanced Trajectory Planner (NEO-Planner), a novel approach that leverages a Neural Network (NN) Planner to provide informed initial values for trajectory optimization. The NN-Planner is trained on a dataset generated by an expert planner using batch sampling, capturing multimodal trajectory solutions. It learns to predict spatial and temporal parameters for trajectories directly from raw sensor observations. NEO-Planner starts optimization from these predictions, accelerating computation speed while maintaining explainability. Furthermore, we introduce a robust online replanning framework that accommodates planning latency for smooth trajectory tracking. Extensive simulations demonstrate that NEO-Planner reduces optimization iterations by 20%, leading to a 26% decrease in computation time compared with pure optimization-based methods. It maintains trajectory quality comparable to baseline approaches and generalizes well to unseen environments. Real-world experiments validate its effectiveness for autonomous drone navigation in cluttered, unknown environments.

Abstract: We propose using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) as reverse transition operator (kernel) within the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) framework, which is one of the most widely used approaches for accelerated sampling from pre-trained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM). Specifically we match the first and second order central moments of the DDPM forward marginals by constraining the parameters of the GMM. We see that moment matching is sufficient to obtain samples with equal or better quality than the original DDIM with Gaussian kernels. We provide experimental results with unconditional models trained on CelebAHQ and FFHQ, class-conditional models trained on ImageNet, and text-to-image generation using Stable Diffusion v2.1 on COYO700M datasets respectively. Our results suggest that using the GMM kernel leads to significant improvements in the quality of the generated samples when the number of sampling steps is small, as measured by FID and IS metrics. For example on ImageNet 256x256, using 10 sampling steps, we achieve a FID of 6.94 and IS of 207.85 with a GMM kernel compared to 10.15 and 196.73 respectively with a Gaussian kernel. Further, we derive novel SDE samplers for rectified flow matching models and experiment with the proposed approach. We see improvements using both 1-rectified flow and 2-rectified flow models.

Abstract: Many multivariate time series anomaly detection frameworks have been proposed and widely applied. However, most of these frameworks do not consider intrinsic relationships between variables in multivariate time series data, thus ignoring the causal relationship among variables and degrading anomaly detection performance. This work proposes a novel framework called CGAD, an entropy Causal Graph for multivariate time series Anomaly Detection. CGAD utilizes transfer entropy to construct graph structures that unveil the underlying causal relationships among time series data. Weighted graph convolutional networks combined with causal convolutions are employed to model both the causal graph structures and the temporal patterns within multivariate time series data. Furthermore, CGAD applies anomaly scoring, leveraging median absolute deviation-based normalization to improve the robustness of the anomaly identification process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CGAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets with a 9% average improvement in terms of three different multivariate time series anomaly detection metrics.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in various general multimodal applications and have shown increasing promise in specialized domains. However, their potential in the insurance domain-characterized by diverse application scenarios and rich multimodal data-remains largely underexplored. To date, there is no systematic review of multimodal tasks, nor a benchmark specifically designed to assess the capabilities of LVLMs in insurance. This gap hinders the development of LVLMs within the insurance industry. This study systematically reviews and categorizes multimodal tasks for 4 representative types of insurance: auto, property, health, and agricultural. We introduce INS-MMBench, the first hierarchical benchmark tailored for the insurance domain. INS-MMBench encompasses 22 fundamental tasks, 12 meta-tasks and 5 scenario tasks, enabling a comprehensive and progressive assessment from basic capabilities to real-world use cases. We benchmark 11 leading LVLMs, including closed-source models such as GPT-4o and open-source models like LLaVA. Our evaluation validates the effectiveness of INS-MMBench and offers detailed insights into the strengths and limitations of current LVLMs on a variety of insurance-related multimodal tasks. We hope that INS-MMBench will accelerate the integration of LVLMs into the insurance industry and foster interdisciplinary research. Our dataset and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/FDU-INS/INS-MMBench.

<title>Reorganizing attention-space geometry with expressive attention</title>

Abstract: Attention regulates information transfer between tokens. For this, query and key vectors are compared, typically in terms of a scalar product, $\mathbf{Q}^T\mathbf{K}$, together with a subsequent softmax normalization. In geometric terms, the standard dot-product attention (DPA) leads to large/small attention weights for parallel/antiparallel queries and keys. Here we study expressive attention (EA), which is based on $(\mathbf{Q}^T\mathbf{K})^2$, the squared dot product. In this case, attention is enhanced when query and key are either parallel or antiparallel, and suppressed for orthogonal configurations. EA can be introduced into any attention-based code without additional compute costs or memory requirements. For a series of autoregressive prediction tasks, we find that expressive attention performs at least as well as vanilla DPA. Increasing task complexity, EA is observed to outperform DPA with increasing margins, which also holds for multi-task settings. For a given model size, EA manages to achieve 100% performance for a range of complexity levels not accessible to DPA. Our results show that it is possible to reorganize the geometry of the matching condition in the space of attention heads without loss of performance.

<title>Spatio-Temporal Partial Sensing Forecast for Long-term Traffic</title>

Abstract: Traffic forecasting uses recent measurements by sensors installed at chosen locations to forecast the future road traffic. Existing work either assumes all locations are equipped with sensors or focuses on short-term forecast. This paper studies partial sensing forecast of long-term traffic, assuming sensors are available only at some locations. The problem is challenging due to the unknown data distribution at unsensed locations, the intricate spatio-temporal correlation in long-term forecasting, as well as noise to traffic patterns. We propose a Spatio-temporal Long-term Partial sensing Forecast model (SLPF) for traffic prediction, with several novel contributions, including a rank-based embedding technique to reduce the impact of noise in data, a spatial transfer matrix to overcome the spatial distribution shift from sensed locations to unsensed locations, and a multi-step training process that utilizes all available data to successively refine the model parameters for better accuracy. Extensive experiments on several real-world traffic datasets demonstrate its superior performance. Our source code is at https://github.com/zbliu98/SLPF

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a cost-efficient approximation to multitask learning. Among merging strategies, task arithmetic is notable for its simplicity and effectiveness. In this work, we provide a theoretical motivation for task vectors by highlighting that, under single-epoch full-batch gradient descent, they are equivalent to multitask gradients. This insight leads us to reinterpret model merging as a single step in an iterative procedure that Alternates between Tuning and Merging (ATM). We propose two applications of ATM: (1) as an alternative to multitask learning in scenarios where data sharing is restricted (e.g., federated settings), and (2) as a lightweight refinement step to improve existing model merging methods using a small validation set. Experiments across diverse vision tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of ATM.

Abstract: Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) for link prediction have introduced sophisticated training techniques and model architectures. However, reliance on outdated baselines may exaggerate the benefits of these new approaches. To tackle this issue, we systematically explore Graph Autoencoders (GAEs) by applying model-agnostic tricks in recent methods and tuning hyperparameters. We find that a well-tuned GAE can match the performance of recent sophisticated models while offering superior computational efficiency on widely-used link prediction benchmarks. Our approach delivers substantial performance gains on datasets where structural information dominates and feature data is limited. Specifically, our GAE achieves a state-of-the-art Hits@100 score of 78.41\% on the ogbl-ppa dataset. Furthermore, we examine the impact of various tricks to uncover the reasons behind our success and to guide the design of future methods. Our study emphasizes the critical need to update baselines for a more accurate assessment of progress in GNNs for link prediction. Our code is available at https://github.com/GraphPKU/Refined-GAE.

Abstract: Despite the success of text retrieval in many NLP tasks, code retrieval remains a largely underexplored area. Most text retrieval systems are tailored for natural language queries, often neglecting the specific challenges of retrieving code. This gap leaves existing models unable to effectively capture the diversity of programming languages and tasks across different domains, highlighting the need for more focused research in code retrieval. To address this, we introduce CodeXEmbed, a family of large-scale code embedding models ranging from 400M to 7B parameters. Our novel training pipeline unifies multiple programming languages and transforms various code-related tasks into a common retrieval framework, enhancing model generalizability and retrieval performance. Our 7B model sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) in code retrieval, outperforming the previous leading model, Voyage-Code, by over 20% on CoIR benchmark. In addition to excelling in code retrieval, our models demonstrate competitive performance on the widely adopted BeIR text retrieval benchmark, offering versatility across domains. Experimental results demonstrate that improving retrieval performance significantly enhances end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) performance for code-related tasks.

<title>DeepMDV: Global Spatial Matching for Multi-depot Vehicle Routing Problems</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17080</link>

arXiv:2411.17080v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of online retail and e-commerce has made effective and efficient Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) solutions essential. To meet rising demand, companies are adding more depots, which changes the VRP problem to a complex optimization task of Multi-Depot VRP (MDVRP) where the routing decisions of vehicles from multiple depots are highly interdependent. The complexities render traditional VRP methods suboptimal and non-scalable for the MDVRP. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to solve MDVRP addressing these interdependencies, hence achieving more effective results. The key idea is, the MDVRP can be broken down into two core spatial tasks: assigning customers to depots and optimizing the sequence of customer visits. We adopt task-decoupling approach and propose a two-stage framework that is scalable: (i) an interdependent partitioning module that embeds spatial and tour context directly into the representation space to globally match customers to depots and assign them to tours; and (ii) an independent routing module that determines the optimal visit sequence within each tour. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms all baselines across varying problem sizes, including the adaptations of learning-based solutions for single-depot VRP. Its adaptability and performance make it a practical and readily deployable solution for real-world logistics challenges.

Abstract: This paper introduces Virtual Try-Off (VTOFF), a novel task generating standardized garment images from single photos of clothed individuals. Unlike Virtual Try-On (VTON), which digitally dresses models, VTOFF extracts canonical garment images, demanding precise reconstruction of shape, texture, and complex patterns, enabling robust evaluation of generative model fidelity. We propose TryOffDiff, adapting Stable Diffusion with SigLIP-based visual conditioning to deliver high-fidelity reconstructions. Experiments on VITON-HD and Dress Code datasets show that TryOffDiff outperforms adapted pose transfer and VTON baselines. We observe that traditional metrics such as SSIM inadequately reflect reconstruction quality, prompting our use of DISTS for reliable assessment. Our findings highlight VTOFF's potential to improve e-commerce product imagery, advance generative model evaluation, and guide future research on high-fidelity reconstruction.

<title>LeakAgent: RL-based Red-teaming Agent for LLM Privacy Leakage</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2412.05734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have discovered that large language models (LLM) may be ``fooled'' to output private information, including training data, system prompts, and personally identifiable information, under carefully crafted adversarial prompts. Existing red-teaming approaches for privacy leakage either rely on manual efforts or focus solely on system prompt extraction, making them ineffective for severe risks of training data leakage. We propose LeakAgent, a novel black-box red-teaming framework for LLM privacy leakage. Our framework trains an open-source LLM through reinforcement learning as the attack agent to generate adversarial prompts for both training data extraction and system prompt extraction. To achieve this, we propose a novel reward function to provide effective and fine-grained rewards and design novel mechanisms to balance exploration and exploitation during learning and enhance the diversity of adversarial prompts. Through extensive evaluations, we first show that LeakAgent significantly outperforms existing rule-based approaches in training data extraction and automated methods in system prompt leakage. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of LeakAgent in extracting system prompts from real-world applications in OpenAI's GPT Store. We further demonstrate LeakAgent's effectiveness in evading the existing guardrail defense and its helpfulness in enabling better safety alignment. Finally, we validate our customized designs through a detailed ablation study. We release our code here https://github.com/rucnyz/LeakAgent.

<title>The Alternative Annotator Test for LLM-as-a-Judge: How to Statistically Justify Replacing Human Annotators with LLMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2501.10970v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The "LLM-as-an-annotator" and "LLM-as-a-judge" paradigms employ Large Language Models (LLMs) as annotators, judges, and evaluators in tasks traditionally performed by humans. LLM annotations are widely used, not only in NLP research but also in fields like medicine, psychology, and social science. Despite their role in shaping study results and insights, there is no standard or rigorous procedure to determine whether LLMs can replace human annotators. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical procedure, the Alternative Annotator Test (alt-test), that requires only a modest subset of annotated examples to justify using LLM annotations. Additionally, we introduce a versatile and interpretable measure for comparing LLM annotators and judges. To demonstrate our procedure, we curated a diverse collection of ten datasets, consisting of language and vision-language tasks, and conducted experiments with six LLMs and four prompting techniques. Our results show that LLMs can sometimes replace humans with closed-source LLMs (such as GPT-4o), outperforming the open-source LLMs we examine, and that prompting techniques yield judges of varying quality. We hope this study encourages more rigorous and reliable practices.

Abstract: Contextual Partitioning introduces an innovative approach to enhancing the architectural design of large-scale computational models through the dynamic segmentation of parameters into context-aware regions. This methodology emphasizes the importance of task-specific specialization, achieved through adaptive parameter allocation mechanisms that align with the linguistic features of input data. Experimental evaluations demonstrated substantial improvements in accuracy, perplexity, and contextual coherence across a variety of linguistic tasks, highlighting the adaptability and scalability of the proposed framework. By reducing redundancy and enhancing computational efficiency, Contextual Partitioning not only streamlines model operations but also expands the scope of applications for advanced language processing systems. The approach operates autonomously, requiring no external fine-tuning, thereby addressing a significant limitation in conventional parameter optimization techniques. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of gradient-driven segmentation, enabling models to dynamically recalibrate and specialize in response to task-specific demands. Furthermore, resource utilization metrics reveal notable reductions in memory usage and training times, confirming the efficiency of the approach. Observations from qualitative analyses illustrate improved contextual coherence and logical flow in generated outputs, reinforcing the practical value of this technique. The findings collectively demonstrate the potential for Contextual Partitioning to redefine the scalability and adaptability of computational language architectures in diverse and complex domains.

arXiv:2501.14119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformative innovations in model architectures have introduced hierarchical embedding augmentation as a means to redefine the representation of tokens through multi-level semantic structures, offering enhanced adaptability to complex linguistic inputs. Autonomous structural memory manipulation further advances this paradigm through dynamic memory reallocation mechanisms that prioritize critical contextual features while suppressing less relevant information, enabling scalable and efficient performance across diverse tasks. Experimental results reveal substantial improvements in computational efficiency, with marked reductions in processing overhead for longer input sequences, achieved through memory reorganization strategies that adapt to evolving contextual requirements. Hierarchical embeddings not only improved contextual alignment but also facilitated task generalization by capturing relationships at varying semantic granularities, ensuring coherence across layers without introducing significant computational redundancies. Comparative analysis against baseline models demonstrated unique advantages in accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability, particularly in tasks requiring complex contextual understanding or domain-specific adaptability. The ability to dynamically adjust token representations and memory configurations contributed to the model's robustness under varied and unpredictable input conditions. Applications benefiting from these advancements include multi-domain generalization, interactive systems, and scenarios involving real-time decision-making, where traditional static memory architectures often face limitations. The proposed methodology combines advanced embedding and memory management strategies into a cohesive framework that addresses scalability challenges while preserving task-specific relevance.

Abstract: Algorithmic modeling relies on limited information in data to extrapolate outcomes for unseen scenarios, often embedding an element of arbitrariness in its decisions. A perspective on this arbitrariness that has recently gained interest is multiplicity-the study of arbitrariness across a set of "good models", i.e., those likely to be deployed in practice. In this work, we systemize the literature on multiplicity by: (a) formalizing the terminology around model design choices and their contribution to arbitrariness, (b) expanding the definition of multiplicity to incorporate underrepresented forms beyond just predictions and explanations, (c) clarifying the distinction between multiplicity and other lenses of arbitrariness, i.e., uncertainty and variance, and (d) distilling the benefits and potential risks of multiplicity into overarching trends, situating it within the broader landscape of responsible AI. We conclude by identifying open research questions and highlighting emerging trends in this young but rapidly growing area of research.

Abstract: The increasing sophistication of encryption-based ransomware has demanded innovative approaches to detection and mitigation, prompting the development of a hierarchical framework grounded in probabilistic cryptographic analysis. By focusing on the statistical characteristics of encryption patterns, the proposed methodology introduces a layered approach that combines advanced clustering algorithms with machine learning to isolate ransomware-induced anomalies. Through comprehensive testing across diverse ransomware families, the framework demonstrated exceptional accuracy, effectively distinguishing malicious encryption operations from benign activities while maintaining low false positive rates. The system's design integrates dynamic feedback mechanisms, enabling adaptability to varying cryptographic complexities and operational environments. Detailed entropy-based evaluations revealed its sensitivity to subtle deviations in encryption workflows, offering a robust alternative to traditional detection methods reliant on static signatures or heuristics. Computational benchmarks confirmed its scalability and efficiency, achieving consistent performance even under high data loads and complex cryptographic scenarios. The inclusion of real-time clustering and anomaly evaluation ensures rapid response capabilities, addressing critical latency challenges in ransomware detection. Performance comparisons with established methods highlighted its improvements in detection efficacy, particularly against advanced ransomware employing extended key lengths and unique cryptographic protocols.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2501.15509v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model fingerprinting is a widely adopted approach to safeguard the intellectual property rights of open-source models by preventing their unauthorized reuse. It is promising and convenient since it does not necessitate modifying the protected model. In this paper, we revisit existing fingerprinting methods and reveal that they are vulnerable to false claim attacks where adversaries falsely assert ownership of any third-party model. We demonstrate that this vulnerability mostly stems from their untargeted nature, where they generally compare the outputs of given samples on different models instead of the similarities to specific references. Motivated by these findings, we propose a targeted fingerprinting paradigm (i.e., FIT-Print) to counteract false claim attacks. Specifically, FIT-Print transforms the fingerprint into a targeted signature via optimization. Building on the principles of FIT-Print, we develop bit-wise and list-wise black-box model fingerprinting methods, i.e., FIT-ModelDiff and FIT-LIME, which exploit the distance between model outputs and the feature attribution of specific samples as the fingerprint, respectively. Extensive experiments on benchmark models and datasets verify the effectiveness, conferrability, and resistance to false claim attacks of our FIT-Print.

arXiv:2501.16658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective token compression remains a critical challenge for scaling models to handle increasingly complex and diverse datasets. A novel mechanism based on contextual reinforcement is introduced, dynamically adjusting token importance through interdependencies and semantic relevance. This approach enables substantial reductions in token usage while preserving the quality and coherence of information representation. Incorporating graph-based algorithms and adaptive weighting, the method captures subtle contextual relationships across textual and multimodal data, ensuring robust alignment and performance in downstream tasks. Evaluations across varied domains reveal significant improvements in accuracy and semantic retention, particularly for tasks requiring detailed cross-modal interactions. Memory usage analyses demonstrate improved computational efficiency, with minimal overhead despite the additional reinforcement processes. Performance gains are further validated through error distribution analyses, showing reduced semantic loss and syntactic inconsistencies compared to baseline models. The modular architecture ensures compatibility with a wide range of open-source frameworks, facilitating scalable implementation for real-world applications. These findings highlight the potential of contextual reinforcement in redefining token management strategies and advancing large-scale model design.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of cyber threats has outpaced traditional detection methodologies, necessitating innovative approaches capable of addressing the adaptive and complex behaviors of modern adversaries. A novel framework was introduced, leveraging Temporal-Correlation Graphs to model the intricate relationships and temporal patterns inherent in malicious operations. The approach dynamically captured behavioral anomalies, offering a robust mechanism for distinguishing between benign and malicious activities in real-time scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrated the framework's effectiveness across diverse ransomware families, with consistently high precision, recall, and overall detection accuracy. Comparative evaluations highlighted its better performance over traditional signature-based and heuristic methods, particularly in handling polymorphic and previously unseen ransomware variants. The architecture was designed with scalability and modularity in mind, ensuring compatibility with enterprise-scale environments while maintaining resource efficiency. Analysis of encryption speeds, anomaly patterns, and temporal correlations provided deeper insights into the operational strategies of ransomware, validating the framework's adaptability to evolving threats. The research contributes to advancing cybersecurity technologies by integrating dynamic graph analytics and machine learning for future innovations in threat detection. Results from this study underline the potential for transforming the way organizations detect and mitigate complex cyberattacks.

Abstract: Contextually Entangled Gradient Mapping (CEGM) introduces a new approach to gradient optimization, redefining the relationship between contextual embeddings and gradient updates to enhance semantic coherence and reasoning capabilities in neural architectures. By treating gradients as dynamic carriers of contextual dependencies rather than isolated numerical entities, the proposed methodology bridges critical gaps in existing optimization strategies. The integration of entangled gradient dynamics into a loss regularization framework demonstrated significant improvements in tasks involving long-form reasoning, contextual retention, and adaptability to unseen domains. Experimental evaluations showed that the CEGM-enhanced model consistently outperformed baseline approaches, achieving higher accuracy in token-level predictions and greater resilience to noisy inputs. Practical implementations involved modifications to training pipelines, introducing entanglement layers and dynamic coefficient adjustments that seamlessly align with existing architectures. Results further highlighted reductions in semantic drift during sequential transformations and improvements in embedding coherence across paraphrased sentences, showing the robustness and versatility of the proposed methodology. The findings demonstrate the broader implications of gradient entanglement for both theoretical advancements and practical applications in optimization strategies.

Abstract: Training large neural network models requires extensive computational resources, often distributed across several nodes and accelerators. Recent findings suggest that it may be sufficient to only exchange the fast moving components of the gradients, while accumulating momentum locally (Decoupled Momentum, or DeMo). However, DeMo assumes that models fit on a single accelerator. We relax this assumption and introduce FlexDeMo, whereby nodes fully shard model parameters locally between different accelerators, while inter-node communication is reduced by synchronizing only fast-moving components instead of the full gradients -- resulting in a hybrid sharded data parallel training strategy. We further introduce a framework, denoted as DeToNATION, that generalizes DeMo, FlexDeMo, and other popular distributed training schemes such as DiLoCo -- introducing new variations of replication schemes and challenging choices made in DeMo. Our results across language and vision domains show that FlexDeMo attains similar validation loss as hybrid sharded data parallel training employing AdamW and full gradient synchronization, while being substantially faster. FlexDeMo is thus a promising distributed training scheme for the largest machine learning models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) have significantly enhanced the prediction of material properties by modeling crystal structures as graphs. However, GNNs often struggle to capture global structural characteristics, such as crystal systems, limiting their predictive performance. To overcome this issue, we propose CAST, a cross-attention-based multimodal model that integrates graph representations with textual descriptions of materials, effectively preserving critical structural and compositional information. Unlike previous approaches, such as CrysMMNet and MultiMat, which rely on aggregated material-level embeddings, CAST leverages cross-attention mechanisms to combine fine-grained graph node-level and text token-level features. Additionally, we introduce a masked node prediction pretraining strategy that further enhances the alignment between node and text embeddings. Our experimental results demonstrate that CAST outperforms existing baseline models across four key material properties-formation energy, band gap, bulk modulus, and shear modulus-with average relative MAE improvements ranging from 10.2% to 35.7%. Analysis of attention maps confirms the importance of pretraining in effectively aligning multimodal representations. This study underscores the potential of multimodal learning frameworks for developing more accurate and globally informed predictive models in materials science.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven effective in integrating external knowledge into large language models (LLMs) for solving question-answer (QA) tasks. The state-of-the-art RAG approaches often use the graph data as the external data since they capture the rich semantic information and link relationships between entities. However, existing graph-based RAG approaches cannot accurately identify the relevant information from the graph and also consume large numbers of tokens in the online retrieval process. To address these issues, we introduce a novel graph-based RAG approach, called Attributed Community-based Hierarchical RAG (ArchRAG), by augmenting the question using attributed communities, and also introducing a novel LLM-based hierarchical clustering method. To retrieve the most relevant information from the graph for the question, we build a novel hierarchical index structure for the attributed communities and develop an effective online retrieval method. Experimental results demonstrate that ArchRAG outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and token cost.

<title>Exploring Synaptic Resonance in Large Language Models: A Novel Approach to Contextual Memory Integration</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10699</link>

arXiv:2502.10699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contextual memory integration remains a high challenge in the development of language models, particularly in tasks that require maintaining coherence over extended sequences. Traditional approaches, such as self-attention mechanisms and memory-augmented architectures, often prioritize short-term dependencies, leading to fragmentation and inconsistency in long-range contextual understanding. Inspired by principles of synaptic plasticity observed in biological neural systems, a novel mechanism, Synaptic Resonance, is introduced to dynamically reinforce relevant memory pathways during training and inference. Unlike static memory representations, this mechanism continuously adjusts synaptic weight matrices based on contextual relevance, allowing for improved information retention without excessive computational overhead. Evaluations conducted on an open-source language model demonstrate reductions in perplexity, enhancements in contextual coherence, and increased robustness against input noise, highlighting the effectiveness of reinforcement-driven memory modulation. Comparative analysis against baseline models further reveals that the proposed approach achieves higher memory retention efficiency while maintaining computational feasibility. The architectural modifications integrate seamlessly into existing transformer-based frameworks, ensuring stable convergence and efficient inference without sacrificing scalability. Applications benefiting from improved long-term contextual consistency, such as dialogue systems and document summarization, stand to gain from this approach. Empirical findings suggest that dynamically reinforced memory pathways offer a promising alternative to conventional memory mechanisms, addressing longstanding limitations in extended sequence modeling.

<title>Topic Over Source: The Key to Effective Data Mixing for Language Models Pre-training</title>

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is significantly affected by the quality and composition of their pre-training data, which is inherently diverse, spanning various languages, sources, and topics. Effectively integrating these heterogeneous data groups is crucial for optimizing LLM performance. Previous research has predominantly concentrated on source-based data mixing, often neglecting the nuanced topic-level characteristics of the data. To address this gap, we propose a topic-based data mixing strategy that utilizes detailed topic labels generated through a multi-stage process combining unsupervised clustering, LLM-based summarization, and supervised classifier training. With this strategy, we conduct the first comprehensive comparison of topic-based versus source-based partitioning across multiple mixing strategies. We demonstrate that language models pretrained on data mixed by topics consistently outperform those trained on data mixed by sources across multiple methods including RegMix, DoReMi,temperature-based sampling, and a manual mixing method based on downstream task performance. Our theoretical analysis reveals that topic-based data achieves significantly lower validation loss compared to source-based approaches, creating a better optimization landscape for model training. We will make our code, annotated datasets, and topic classification models publicly available to facilitate further research.

Abstract: Predicting the distribution of outcomes under hypothetical interventions is crucial across healthcare, economics, and policy-making. However, existing methods often require restrictive assumptions, and are typically limited by the lack of amortization across problem instances. We propose ACTIVA, a transformer-based conditional variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture for amortized causal inference, which estimates interventional distributions directly from observational data without. ACTIVA learns a latent representation conditioned on observational inputs and intervention queries, enabling zero-shot inference by amortizing causal knowledge from diverse training scenarios. We provide theoretical insights showing that ACTIVA predicts interventional distributions as mixtures over observationally equivalent causal models. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets confirm the effectiveness of our amortized approach and highlight promising directions for future real-world applications.

Abstract: Recent works have shown great potentials of Large Language Models (LLMs) in robot task and motion planning (TAMP). Current LLM approaches generate text- or code-based reasoning chains with sub-goals and action plans. However, they do not fully leverage LLMs' symbolic computing and code generation capabilities. Many robot TAMP tasks involve complex optimization under multiple constraints, where pure textual reasoning is insufficient. While augmenting LLMs with predefined solvers and planners improves performance, it lacks generalization across tasks. Given LLMs' growing coding proficiency, we enhance their TAMP capabilities by steering them to generate code as symbolic planners for optimization and constraint verification. Unlike prior work that uses code to interface with robot action modules, we steer LLMs to generate code as solvers, planners, and checkers for TAMP tasks requiring symbolic computing, while still leveraging textual reasoning to incorporate common sense. With a multi-round guidance and answer evolution framework, the proposed Code-as-Symbolic-Planner improves success rates by average 24.1\% over best baseline methods across seven typical TAMP tasks and three popular LLMs. Code-as-Symbolic-Planner shows strong effectiveness and generalizability across discrete and continuous environments, 2D/3D simulations and real-world settings, as well as single- and multi-robot tasks with diverse requirements.

Abstract: Dynamically integrating new or rapidly evolving information after (Large) Language Model pre-training remains challenging, particularly in low-data scenarios or when dealing with private and specialized documents. In-context learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) face limitations, including their high inference costs and their inability to capture global document information. In this paper, we propose a way of modularizing knowledge by training document-level Knowledge Modules (KMs). KMs are lightweight components implemented as parameter-efficient LoRA modules, which are trained to store information about new documents and can be easily plugged into models on demand. We show that next-token prediction performs poorly as the training objective for KMs. We instead propose Deep Context Distillation: we learn KMs parameters such as to simulate hidden states and logits of a teacher that takes the document in context. Our method outperforms standard next-token prediction and pre-instruction training techniques, across two datasets. Finally, we highlight synergies between KMs and RAG.

<title>CodeARC: Benchmarking Reasoning Capabilities of LLM Agents for Inductive Program Synthesis</title>

Abstract: Inductive program synthesis, or programming by example, requires synthesizing functions from input-output examples that generalize to unseen inputs. While large language model agents have shown promise in programming tasks guided by natural language, their ability to perform inductive program synthesis is underexplored. Existing evaluation protocols rely on static sets of examples and held-out tests, offering no feedback when synthesized functions are incorrect and failing to reflect real-world scenarios such as reverse engineering. We propose CodeARC, the Code Abstraction and Reasoning Challenge, a new evaluation framework where agents interact with a hidden target function by querying it with new inputs, synthesizing candidate functions, and iteratively refining their solutions using a differential testing oracle. This interactive setting encourages agents to perform function calls and self-correction based on feedback. We construct the first large-scale benchmark for general-purpose inductive program synthesis, featuring 1114 functions. Among 18 models evaluated, o3-mini performs best with a success rate of 52.7%, highlighting the difficulty of this task. Fine-tuning LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct on curated synthesis traces yields up to a 31% relative performance gain. CodeARC provides a more realistic and challenging testbed for evaluating LLM-based program synthesis and inductive reasoning. Our code, data, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/Anjiang-Wei/CodeARC

<title>Evaluating and Designing Sparse Autoencoders by Approximating Quasi-Orthogonality</title>

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are widely used in mechanistic interpretability research for large language models; however, the state-of-the-art method of using $k$-sparse autoencoders lacks a theoretical grounding for selecting the hyperparameter $k$ that represents the number of nonzero activations, often denoted by $\ell_0$. In this paper, we reveal a theoretical link that the $\ell_2$-norm of the sparse feature vector can be approximated with the $\ell_2$-norm of the dense vector with a closed-form error, which allows sparse autoencoders to be trained without the need to manually determine $\ell_0$. Specifically, we validate two applications of our theoretical findings. First, we introduce a new methodology that can assess the feature activations of pre-trained SAEs by computing the theoretically expected value from the input embedding, which has been overlooked by existing SAE evaluation methods and loss functions. Second, we introduce a novel activation function, top-AFA, which builds upon our formulation of approximate feature activation (AFA). This function enables top-$k$ style activation without requiring a constant hyperparameter $k$ to be tuned, dynamically determining the number of activated features for each input. By training SAEs on three intermediate layers to reconstruct GPT2 hidden embeddings for over 80 million tokens from the OpenWebText dataset, we demonstrate the empirical merits of this approach and compare it with current state-of-the-art $k$-sparse autoencoders.

<title>M$^2$IV: Towards Efficient and Fine-grained Multimodal In-Context Learning via Representation Engineering</title>

Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) equips Large Vision-language Models (LVLMs) with the ability to adapt to new tasks via multiple user-provided demonstrations, without requiring any model parameter updates. However, its effectiveness is constrained by the token-intensive nature of multimodal inputs and the complexity of cross-modal few-shot reasoning, which together hinder LVLMs from extracting useful patterns from demonstrations. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{M$^2$IV}, a novel representation engineering approach that replaces explicit token-level demonstrations with a set of learnable Multimodal In-context Vectors directly injected into the residual streams of LVLMs. By analyzing the distinct roles of multi-head attention (MHA) and multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) in the ICL process, we design a training strategy that enables M$^2$IV to perform fine-grained semantic distillation and robust cross-modal representation learning. M$^2$IV not only improves performance across diverse tasks and LVLMs but also significantly reduces token overhead, enabling graceful scaling to many-shot scenarios. To further enhance usability, we introduce \textbf{VLibrary}, a repository that stores trained M$^2$IVs for flexible retrieval and injection. With VLibrary, users can steer pre-trained LVLMs in a customized manner that meets diverse requirements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that M$^2$IV consistently outperforms vanilla ICL and prior representation engineering baselines, achieving an average accuracy gain of 3.74\% with substantial improvements in overall efficiency.

Abstract: While test-time reasoning enables language models (LMs) to tackle complex tasks, searching or planning in natural language can be slow, costly, and error-prone. But even when LMs struggle to emulate the precise reasoning steps needed to solve a problem, they often excel at describing its abstract structure--both how to verify solutions and how to search for them. This paper introduces DisCIPL, a method for "self-steering" LMs where a Planner model generates a task-specific inference program that is executed by a population of Follower models. Our approach equips LMs with the ability to write recursive search procedures that guide LM inference, enabling new forms of verifiable and efficient reasoning. When instantiated with a small Follower (e.g., Llama-3.2-1B or Qwen3-1.7B), DisCIPL matches (and sometimes outperforms) much larger models, including GPT-4o and o1, on challenging constrained generation tasks. Our work opens up a design space of highly-parallelized Monte Carlo inference strategies that outperform standard best-of-N sampling, require no finetuning, and can be implemented automatically by existing LMs.

Abstract: How do the latent spaces used by independently-trained LLMs relate to one another? We study the nearest neighbor relationships induced by activations at different layers of 24 open-weight LLMs, and find that they 1) tend to vary from layer to layer within a model, and 2) are approximately shared between corresponding layers of different models. Claim 2 shows that these nearest neighbor relationships are not arbitrary, as they are shared across models, but Claim 1 shows that they are not "obvious" either, as there is no single set of nearest neighbor relationships that is universally shared. Together, these suggest that LLMs generate a progression of activation geometries from layer to layer, but that this entire progression is largely shared between models, stretched and squeezed to fit into different architectures.

Abstract: Standardized surveys scale efficiently but sacrifice depth, while conversational interviews improve response quality at the cost of scalability and consistency. This study bridges the gap between these methods by introducing a framework for AI-assisted conversational interviewing. To evaluate this framework, we conducted a web survey experiment where 1,800 participants were randomly assigned to AI 'chatbots' which use large language models (LLMs) to dynamically probe respondents for elaboration and interactively code open-ended responses to fixed questions developed by human researchers. We assessed the AI chatbot's performance in terms of coding accuracy, response quality, and respondent experience. Our findings reveal that AI chatbots perform moderately well in live coding even without survey-specific fine-tuning, despite slightly inflated false positive errors due to respondent acquiescence bias. Open-ended responses were more detailed and informative, but this came at a slight cost to respondent experience. Our findings highlight the feasibility of using AI methods such as chatbots enhanced by LLMs to enhance open-ended data collection in web surveys.

Abstract: As time evolves, data within specific domains exhibit predictability that motivates time series forecasting to predict future trends from historical data. However, current deep forecasting methods can achieve promising performance but generally lack interpretability, hindering trustworthiness and practical deployment in safety-critical applications such as auto-driving and healthcare. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretable model, iTFKAN, for credible time series forecasting. iTFKAN enables further exploration of model decision rationales and underlying data patterns due to its interpretability achieved through model symbolization. Besides, iTFKAN develops two strategies, prior knowledge injection, and time-frequency synergy learning, to effectively guide model learning under complex intertwined time series data. Extensive experimental results demonstrated that iTFKAN can achieve promising forecasting performance while simultaneously possessing high interpretive capabilities.

<title>SMOGAN: Synthetic Minority Oversampling with GAN Refinement for Imbalanced Regression</title>

Abstract: Imbalanced regression refers to prediction tasks where the target variable is skewed. This skewness hinders machine learning models, especially neural networks, which concentrate on dense regions and therefore perform poorly on underrepresented (minority) samples. Despite the importance of this problem, only a few methods have been proposed for imbalanced regression. Many of the available solutions for imbalanced regression adapt techniques from the class imbalance domain, such as linear interpolation and the addition of Gaussian noise, to create synthetic data in sparse regions. However, in many cases, the underlying distribution of the data is complex and non-linear. Consequently, these approaches generate synthetic samples that do not accurately represent the true feature-target relationship. To overcome these limitations, we propose SMOGAN, a two-step oversampling framework for imbalanced regression. In Stage 1, an existing oversampler generates initial synthetic samples in sparse target regions. In Stage 2, we introduce DistGAN, a distribution-aware GAN that serves as SMOGAN's filtering layer and refines these samples via adversarial loss augmented with a Maximum Mean Discrepancy objective, aligning them with the true joint feature-target distribution. Extensive experiments on 23 imbalanced datasets show that SMOGAN consistently outperforms the default oversampling method without the DistGAN filtering layer.

Abstract: Machine learning models have utilized semantic features, deep features, or both to assess lung nodule malignancy. However, their reliance on manual annotation during inference, limited interpretability, and sensitivity to imaging variations hinder their application in real-world clinical settings. Thus, this research aims to integrate semantic features derived from radiologists' assessments of nodules, guiding the model to learn clinically relevant, robust, and explainable imaging features for predicting lung cancer. We obtained 938 low-dose CT scans from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) with 1,246 nodules and semantic features. Additionally, the Lung Image Database Consortium dataset contains 1,018 CT scans, with 2,625 lesions annotated for nodule characteristics. Three external datasets were obtained from UCLA Health, the LUNGx Challenge, and the Duke Lung Cancer Screening. We fine-tuned a pretrained Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model with a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach to align imaging and semantic text features and predict the one-year lung cancer diagnosis. Our model outperformed state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in the NLST test set with an AUROC of 0.901 and AUPRC of 0.776. It also showed robust results in external datasets. Using CLIP, we also obtained predictions on semantic features through zero-shot inference, such as nodule margin (AUROC: 0.812), nodule consistency (0.812), and pleural attachment (0.840). Our approach surpasses the SOTA models in predicting lung cancer across datasets collected from diverse clinical settings, providing explainable outputs, aiding clinicians in comprehending the underlying meaning of model predictions. This approach also prevents the model from learning shortcuts and generalizes across clinical settings. The code is available at https://github.com/luotingzhuang/CLIP_nodule.

Abstract: Short video platforms like YouTube Shorts and TikTok face significant copyright compliance challenges, as infringers frequently embed arbitrary background music (BGM) to obscure original soundtracks (OST) and evade content originality detection. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates Music Source Separation (MSS) and cross-modal video-music retrieval (CMVMR). Our approach effectively separates arbitrary BGM from the original OST, enabling the restoration of authentic video audio tracks. To support this work, we introduce two domain-specific datasets: OASD-20K for audio separation and OSVAR-160 for pipeline evaluation. OASD-20K contains 20,000 audio clips featuring mixed BGM and OST pairs, while OSVAR-160 is a unique benchmark dataset comprising 1,121 video and mixed-audio pairs, specifically designed for short video restoration tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our pipeline not only removes arbitrary BGM with high accuracy but also restores OSTs, ensuring content integrity. This approach provides an ethical and scalable solution to copyright challenges in user-generated content on short video platforms.

Abstract: Textual adversarial attacks mislead NLP models, including Large Language Models (LLMs), by subtly modifying text. While effective, existing attacks often require knowledge of the victim model, extensive queries, or access to training data, limiting real-world feasibility. To overcome these constraints, we introduce the \textbf{Victim Data-based Adversarial Attack (VDBA)}, which operates using only victim texts. To prevent access to the victim model, we create a shadow dataset with publicly available pre-trained models and clustering methods as a foundation for developing substitute models. To address the low attack success rate (ASR) due to insufficient information feedback, we propose the hierarchical substitution model design, generating substitute models to mitigate the failure of a single substitute model at the decision boundary.
  Concurrently, we use diverse adversarial example generation, employing various attack methods to generate and select the adversarial example with better similarity and attack effectiveness. Experiments on the Emotion and SST5 datasets show that VDBA outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an ASR improvement of 52.08\% while significantly reducing attack queries to 0. More importantly, we discover that VDBA poses a significant threat to LLMs such as Qwen2 and the GPT family, and achieves the highest ASR of 45.99% even without access to the API, confirming that advanced NLP models still face serious security risks.

<title>Are Large Language Models Robust in Understanding Code Against Semantics-Preserving Mutations?</title>

Abstract: Understanding the reasoning and robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for their reliable use in programming tasks. While recent studies have assessed LLMs' ability to predict program outputs, most focus solely on the accuracy of those predictions, without evaluating the reasoning behind them. Moreover, it has been observed on mathematical reasoning tasks that LLMs can arrive at correct answers through flawed logic, raising concerns about similar issues in code understanding. In this work, we evaluate whether state-of-the-art LLMs with up to 8B parameters can reason about Python programs or are simply guessing. We apply five semantics-preserving code mutations: renaming variables, mirroring comparison expressions, swapping if-else branches, converting for loops to while, and loop unrolling. These mutations maintain program semantics while altering its syntax. We evaluated six LLMs and performed a human expert analysis using LiveCodeBench to assess whether the correct predictions are based on sound reasoning. We also evaluated prediction stability across different code mutations on LiveCodeBench and CruxEval. Our findings show that LLMs trained for code produce correct predictions based on flawed reasoning between 10% and 50% of cases. Furthermore, LLMs often change predictions in response to our code mutations, indicating they do not yet exhibit stable, semantically grounded reasoning.

<title>LaDi-WM: A Latent Diffusion-based World Model for Predictive Manipulation</title>

Abstract: Predictive manipulation has recently gained considerable attention in the Embodied AI community due to its potential to improve robot policy performance by leveraging predicted states. However, generating accurate future visual states of robot-object interactions from world models remains a well-known challenge, particularly in achieving high-quality pixel-level representations. To this end, we propose LaDi-WM, a world model that predicts the latent space of future states using diffusion modeling. Specifically, LaDi-WM leverages the well-established latent space aligned with pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which comprises both geometric features (DINO-based) and semantic features (CLIP-based). We find that predicting the evolution of the latent space is easier to learn and more generalizable than directly predicting pixel-level images. Building on LaDi-WM, we design a diffusion policy that iteratively refines output actions by incorporating forecasted states, thereby generating more consistent and accurate results. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that LaDi-WM significantly enhances policy performance by 27.9\% on the LIBERO-LONG benchmark and 20\% on the real-world scenario. Furthermore, our world model and policies achieve impressive generalizability in real-world experiments.

Abstract: Incorporating external knowledge is crucial for knowledge-intensive tasks, such as question answering and fact checking. However, language models (LMs) may ignore relevant information that contradicts outdated parametric memory or be distracted by irrelevant contexts. While many context utilisation manipulation techniques (CMTs) have recently been proposed to alleviate these issues, few have seen systematic comparison. In this paper, we develop CUB (Context Utilisation Benchmark) - the first comprehensive benchmark designed to help practitioners within retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) diagnose CMTs under different context conditions. With this benchmark, we conduct the most extensive evaluation to date of seven state-of-the-art methods, representative of the main categories of CMTs, across three diverse datasets and tasks, applied to nine LMs. Our results reveal that most existing CMTs struggle to handle the full spectrum of context types encountered in real-world retrieval-augmented scenarios. We also find that many CMTs display inflated performance on simple synthesised datasets, compared to more realistic datasets with naturally occurring samples. Our findings expose critical gaps in current CMT evaluation practices and demonstrate the need for holistic testing and the development of CMTs that can robustly handle multiple context types.

<title>LLM-Meta-SR: In-Context Learning for Evolving Selection Operators in Symbolic Regression</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized algorithm development, yet their application in symbolic regression, where algorithms automatically discover symbolic expressions from data, remains constrained and is typically designed manually by human experts. In this paper, we propose a meta learning framework that enables LLMs to automatically design selection operators for evolutionary symbolic regression algorithms. We first identify two key limitations in existing LLM-based algorithm evolution techniques: a lack of semantic guidance and code bloat. The absence of semantic awareness can lead to ineffective exchange of useful code components, and bloat results in unnecessarily complex components, both of which can reduce the interpretability of the designed algorithm or hinder evolutionary learning progress. To address these issues, we enhance the LLM-based evolution framework for meta symbolic regression with two key innovations: a complementary, semantics-aware selection operator and bloat control. Additionally, we embed domain knowledge into the prompt, enabling the LLM to generate more effective and contextually relevant selection operators. Our experimental results on symbolic regression benchmarks show that LLMs can devise selection operators that outperform nine expert-designed baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, the evolved operator can further improve the state-of-the-art symbolic regression algorithm, achieving the best performance among 26 symbolic regression and machine learning algorithms across 116 regression datasets. This demonstrates that LLMs can exceed expert-level algorithm design for symbolic regression.

<title>Fusing Cross-Domain Knowledge from Multimodal Data to Solve Problems in the Physical World</title>

Abstract: The proliferation of artificial intelligence has enabled a diversity of applications that bridge the gap between digital and physical worlds. As physical environments are too complex to model through a single information acquisition approach, it is crucial to fuse multimodal data generated by different sources, such as sensors, devices, systems, and people, to solve a problem in the real world. Unfortunately, it is neither applicable nor sustainable to deploy new resources to collect original data from scratch for every problem. Thus, when data is inadequate in the domain of problem, it is vital to fuse knowledge from multimodal data that is already available in other domains. We call this cross-domain knowledge fusion. Existing research focus on fusing multimodal data in a single domain, supposing the knowledge from different datasets is intrinsically aligned; however, this assumption may not hold in the scenarios of cross-domain knowledge fusion. In this paper, we formally define the cross-domain multimodal data fusion problem, discussing its unique challenges, differences and advantages beyond data fusion in a single domain. We propose a four-layer framework, consisting of Domains, Links, Models and Data layers, answering three key questions:"what to fuse", "why can be fused", and "how to fuse". The Domains Layer selects relevant data from different domains for a given problem. The Links Layer reveals the philosophy of knowledge alignment beyond specific model structures. The Models Layer provides two knowledge fusion paradigms based on the fundamental mechanisms for processing data. The Data Layer turns data of different structures, resolutions, scales and distributions into a consistent representation that can be fed into an AI model. With this framework, we can design solutions that fuse cross-domain multimodal data effectively for solving real-world problems.

<title>AVA-Bench: Atomic Visual Ability Benchmark for Vision Foundation Models</title>

arXiv:2506.09082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of vision foundation models (VFMs) calls for systematic evaluation. A common approach pairs VFMs with large language models (LLMs) as general-purpose heads, followed by evaluation on broad Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks. However, this protocol has two key blind spots: (i) the instruction tuning data may not align with VQA test distributions, meaning a wrong prediction can stem from such data mismatch rather than a VFM' visual shortcomings; (ii) VQA benchmarks often require multiple visual abilities, making it hard to tell whether errors stem from lacking all required abilities or just a single critical one. To address these gaps, we introduce AVA-Bench, the first benchmark that explicitly disentangles 14 Atomic Visual Abilities (AVAs) -- foundational skills like localization, depth estimation, and spatial understanding that collectively support complex visual reasoning tasks. By decoupling AVAs and matching training and test distributions within each, AVA-Bench pinpoints exactly where a VFM excels or falters. Applying AVA-Bench to leading VFMs thus reveals distinctive "ability fingerprints," turning VFM selection from educated guesswork into principled engineering. Notably, we find that a 0.5B LLM yields similar VFM rankings as a 7B LLM while cutting GPU hours by 8x, enabling more efficient evaluation. By offering a comprehensive and transparent benchmark, we hope AVA-Bench lays the foundation for the next generation of VFMs.

<title>No Universal Prompt: Unifying Reasoning through Adaptive Prompting for Temporal Table Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Temporal Table Reasoning is a critical challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), requiring effective reasoning to extract relevant insights. Despite existence of multiple prompting methods, their impact on table reasoning remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, model performance varies drastically across different table and context structures, making it difficult to determine an optimal approach. This work investigates multiple prompting technique on diverse table types to determine that performance depends on factors such as entity type, table structure, requirement of additional context and question complexity, with "NO" single method consistently outperforming others. To address this, we introduce SEAR, an adaptive prompting framework inspired by human reasoning that dynamically adjusts to context and integrates structured reasoning. Our results demonstrate that SEAR achieves superior performance across all table types compared to baseline prompting techniques. Additionally, we explore the impact of table structure refactoring, finding that a unified representation enhances model reasoning.

<title>Scientifically-Interpretable Reasoning Network (ScIReN): Discovering Hidden Relationships in the Carbon Cycle and Beyond</title>

Abstract: Understanding how carbon flows through the soil is crucial for mitigating the effects of climate change. While soils have potential to sequester carbon from the atmosphere, the soil carbon cycle remains poorly understood. Scientists have developed mathematical process-based models of the soil carbon cycle based on existing knowledge, but they contain numerous unknown parameters that must be set in an ad-hoc manner, and often fit observations poorly. On the other hand, neural networks can learn patterns from data, but do not respect known scientific laws, nor can they reveal novel scientific relationships due to their black-box nature. We thus propose Scientifically-Interpretable Reasoning Network (ScIReN), a fully-transparent framework that combines interpretable neural and process-based reasoning. An interpretable encoder predicts scientifically-meaningful latent parameters, which are then passed through a differentiable process-based decoder to predict labeled output variables. ScIReN leverages Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) to ensure the encoder is fully interpretable and reveals relationships between input features and latent parameters; it uses novel smoothness penalties to balance expressivity and simplicity. ScIReN also uses a novel hard-sigmoid constraint layer to restrict latent parameters to meaningful ranges defined by scientific prior knowledge. While the process-based decoder enforces established scientific knowledge, the KAN-based encoder reveals new scientific relationships hidden in conventional black-box models. We apply ScIReN on two tasks: simulating the flow of organic carbon through soils, and modeling ecosystem respiration from plants. In both tasks, ScIReN outperforms black-box networks in predictive accuracy while providing substantial scientific interpretability -- it can infer latent scientific mechanisms and their relationships with input features.

Abstract: Time series forecasting aims to model temporal dependencies among variables for future state inference, holding significant importance and widespread applications in real-world scenarios. Although deep learning-based methods have achieved remarkable progress, they still exhibit suboptimal performance in long-term forecasting and data-scarce scenarios. Recent research demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) achieve promising performance in time series forecasting. However, we find existing LLM-based methods still have shortcomings: (1) the absence of a unified paradigm for textual prompt formulation and (2) the neglect of modality discrepancies between textual prompts and time series. To address this, we propose LLM-Prompt, an LLM-based time series forecasting framework integrating multi-prompt information and cross-modal semantic alignment. Specifically, we first construct a unified textual prompt paradigm containing learnable soft prompts and textualized hard prompts. Second, to enhance LLMs' comprehensive understanding of the forecasting task, we design a semantic space embedding and cross-modal alignment module to achieve cross-modal fusion of temporal and textual information. Finally, the transformed time series from the LLMs are projected to obtain the forecasts. Comprehensive evaluations on 6 public datasets and 3 carbon emission datasets demonstrate that LLM-Prompt is a powerful framework for time series forecasting.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses with inherent biases, undermining their reliability in real-world applications. Existing evaluation methods often overlook biases in long-form responses and the intrinsic variability of LLM outputs. To address these challenges, we propose FiSCo(Fine-grained Semantic Computation), a novel statistical framework to evaluate group-level fairness in LLMs by detecting subtle semantic differences in long-form responses across demographic groups. Unlike prior work focusing on sentiment or token-level comparisons, FiSCo goes beyond surface-level analysis by operating at the claim level, leveraging entailment checks to assess the consistency of meaning across responses. We decompose model outputs into semantically distinct claims and apply statistical hypothesis testing to compare inter- and intra-group similarities, enabling robust detection of subtle biases. We formalize a new group counterfactual fairness definition and validate FiSCo on both synthetic and human-annotated datasets spanning gender, race, and age. Experiments show that FiSco more reliably identifies nuanced biases while reducing the impact of stochastic LLM variability, outperforming various evaluation metrics.

Abstract: In order to increase the effectiveness of model training, data reduction is essential to data-centric Artificial Intelligence (AI). It achieves this by locating the most instructive examples in massive datasets. To increase data quality and training efficiency, the main difficulty is choosing the best examples rather than the complete datasets. In this paper, we propose an effective data reduction strategy based on Pointwise V-Information (PVI). To enable a static method, we first use PVI to quantify instance difficulty and remove instances with low difficulty. Experiments show that classifier performance is maintained with only a 0.0001% to 0.76% decline in accuracy when 10%-30% of the data is removed. Second, we train the classifiers using a progressive learning strategy on examples sorted by increasing PVI, accelerating convergence and achieving a 0.8% accuracy gain over conventional training. Our findings imply that training a classifier on the chosen optimal subset may improve model performance and increase training efficiency when combined with an efficient data reduction strategy. Furthermore, we have adapted the PVI framework, which was previously limited to English datasets, to a variety of Chinese Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks and base models, yielding insightful results for faster training and cross-lingual data reduction.

Abstract: Insect pests continue to bring a serious threat to crop yields around the world, and traditional methods for monitoring them are often slow, manual, and difficult to scale. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful solution, with techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), vision transformers (ViTs), and hybrid models gaining popularity for automating pest detection. This review looks at 37 carefully selected studies published between 2018 and 2025, all focused on AI-based pest classification. The selected research is organized by crop type, pest species, model architecture, dataset usage, and key technical challenges. The early studies relied heavily on CNNs but latest work is shifting toward hybrid and transformer-based models that deliver higher accuracy and better contextual understanding. Still, challenges like imbalanced datasets, difficulty in detecting small pests, limited generalizability, and deployment on edge devices remain significant hurdles. Overall, this review offers a structured overview of the field, highlights useful datasets, and outlines the key challenges and future directions for AI-based pest monitoring systems.

<title>Humans overrely on overconfident language models, across languages</title>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are deployed globally, it is crucial that their responses are calibrated across languages to accurately convey uncertainty and limitations. Prior work shows that LLMs are linguistically overconfident in English, leading users to overrely on confident generations. However, the usage and interpretation of epistemic markers (e.g., 'I think it's') differs sharply across languages. Here, we study the risks of multilingual linguistic (mis)calibration, overconfidence, and overreliance across five languages to evaluate LLM safety in a global context. Our work finds that overreliance risks are high across languages. We first analyze the distribution of LLM-generated epistemic markers and observe that LLMs are overconfident across languages, frequently generating strengtheners even as part of incorrect responses. Model generations are, however, sensitive to documented cross-linguistic variation in usage: for example, models generate the most markers of uncertainty in Japanese and the most markers of certainty in German and Mandarin. Next, we measure human reliance rates across languages, finding that reliance behaviors differ cross-linguistically: for example, participants are significantly more likely to discount expressions of uncertainty in Japanese than in English (i.e., ignore their 'hedging' function and rely on generations that contain them). Taken together, these results indicate a high risk of reliance on overconfident model generations across languages. Our findings highlight the challenges of multilingual linguistic calibration and stress the importance of culturally and linguistically contextualized model safety evaluations.

<title>Pretraining on the Test Set Is No Longer All You Need: A Debate-Driven Approach to QA Benchmarks</title>

Abstract: As frontier language models increasingly saturate standard QA benchmarks, concerns about data contamination, memorization, and escalating dataset creation costs persist. We propose a debate-driven evaluation paradigm that transforms any existing QA dataset into structured adversarial debates--where one model is given the official answer to defend, and another constructs and defends an alternative answer--adjudicated by a judge model blind to the correct solution. By forcing multi-round argumentation, this approach substantially increases difficulty while penalizing shallow memorization, yet reuses QA items to reduce curation overhead. We make two main contributions: (1) an evaluation pipeline to systematically convert QA tasks into debate-based assessments, and (2) a public benchmark that demonstrates our paradigm's effectiveness on a subset of MMLU-Pro questions, complete with standardized protocols and reference models. Empirical results validate the robustness of the method and its effectiveness against data contamination--a Llama 3.1 model fine-tuned on test questions showed dramatic accuracy improvements (50% -> 82%) but performed worse in debates. Results also show that even weaker judges can reliably differentiate stronger debaters, highlighting how debate-based evaluation can scale to future, more capable systems while maintaining a fraction of the cost of creating new benchmarks. Overall, our framework underscores that "pretraining on the test set is no longer all you need," offering a sustainable path for measuring the genuine reasoning ability of advanced language models.

Abstract: Visual relation detection (VRD) is the task of identifying the relationships between objects in a scene. VRD models trained solely on relation detection data struggle to generalize beyond the relations on which they are trained. While prompt tuning has been used to adapt vision-language models (VLMs) for VRD, it uses handcrafted prompts and struggles with novel or complex relations. We argue that instruction tuning offers a more effective solution by fine-tuning VLMs on diverse instructional data. We thus introduce ART, an Adaptive Relation Tuning framework that adapts VLMs for VRD through instruction tuning and strategic instance selection. By converting VRD datasets into an instruction tuning format and employing an adaptive sampling algorithm, ART directs the VLM to focus on informative relations while maintaining generalizability. Specifically, we focus on the relation classification, where subject-object boxes are given and the model predicts the predicate between them. We tune on a held-in set and evaluate across multiple held-out datasets of varying complexity. Our approach strongly improves over its baselines and can infer unseen relation concepts, a capability absent in mainstream VRD methods. We demonstrate ART's practical value by using the predicted relations for segmenting complex scenes.

Abstract: Weld defect detection is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of piping systems in the oil and gas industry, especially in challenging marine and offshore environments. Traditional non-destructive testing (NDT) methods often fail to detect subtle or internal defects, leading to potential failures and costly downtime. Furthermore, existing neural network-based approaches for defect classification frequently rely on arbitrarily selected pretrained architectures and lack interpretability, raising safety concerns for deployment. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ``Adapt-WeldNet", an adaptive framework for welding defect detection that systematically evaluates various pre-trained architectures, transfer learning strategies, and adaptive optimizers to identify the best-performing model and hyperparameters, optimizing defect detection and providing actionable insights. Additionally, a novel Defect Detection Interpretability Analysis (DDIA) framework is proposed to enhance system transparency. DDIA employs Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as Grad-CAM and LIME, alongside domain-specific evaluations validated by certified ASNT NDE Level II professionals. Incorporating a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approach and aligning with the principles of Trustworthy AI, DDIA ensures the reliability, fairness, and accountability of the defect detection system, fostering confidence in automated decisions through expert validation. By improving both performance and interpretability, this work enhances trust, safety, and reliability in welding defect detection systems, supporting critical operations in offshore and marine environments.

Abstract: Current Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) underutilize the temporal dynamics inherent in spike-based processing, relying primarily on rate coding while overlooking precise timing information that provides rich computational cues. We propose SPARTA (Spiking Priority Attention with Resource-Adaptive Temporal Allocation), a framework that leverages heterogeneous neuron dynamics and spike-timing information to enable efficient sparse attention. SPARTA prioritizes tokens based on temporal cues, including firing patterns, spike timing, and inter-spike intervals, achieving 65.4% sparsity through competitive gating. By selecting only the most salient tokens, SPARTA reduces attention complexity from O(N^2) to O(K^2) with k << n, while maintaining high accuracy. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on DVS-Gesture (98.78%) and competitive results on CIFAR10-DVS (83.06%) and CIFAR-10 (95.3%), demonstrating that exploiting spike timing dynamics improves both computational efficiency and accuracy.

<div> Workflow domain, Large Language Model, NL2Flow, planning problems, evaluation data  
Summary:  
NL2Flow is a system designed to generate planning problems for Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural language, structured intermediate representation, and formal PDDL, enabling rigorous plan evaluation. Results show that LLMs achieve 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal plans for low-difficulty problems. Model performance is influenced by problem characteristics and prompt design. LLMs translating natural language to JSON representation of workflow problems have lower success rates compared to generating plans directly, indicating the benefit of models capable of reasoning directly from natural language to action. Understanding the bottlenecks and sources of error in LLM reasoning on complex problems is essential for their scalability and effectiveness.  
Summary: <div>

Abstract: Effective agent performance relies on the ability to compose tools and agents into effective workflows. However, progress in Large Language Model (LLM) planning and reasoning is limited by the scarcity of scalable, reliable evaluation data. This study addresses this limitation by identifying a suitable workflow domain for LLM application. I introduce NL2Flow, a fully automated system for parametrically generating planning problems, which are expressed in natural language, a structured intermediate representation, and formal PDDL, and rigorously evaluating the quality of generated plans. NL2Flow generates a dataset of 2296 low-difficulty problems in automated workflow generation and evaluates multiple open-sourced, instruct-tuned LLMs without task-specific optimization or architectural modifications. Results reveal that the highest performing model achieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal plans, specifically for problems with feasible plans. Regression analysis shows that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is contingent on both model and prompt design. To investigate the potential of LLMs as natural language-to-JSON translators for workflow definition, and to facilitate integration with downstream symbolic computation tools and a symbolic planner, I evaluated the LLM's translation performance on natural language workflow descriptions. I observed that translating natural language into a JSON representation of a workflow problem yielded a lower success rate than generating a plan directly, suggesting that unnecessary decomposition of the reasoning task may degrade performance and highlighting the benefit of models capable of reasoning directly from natural language to action. As LLM reasoning scales to increasingly complex problems, understanding the shifting bottlenecks and sources of error within these systems will be crucial.

<div> adaptive-density Gaussian Splatting, fruit counting, language guidance, 3D reconstruction, semantic retrieval
Summary:
FruitLangGS is a novel framework for accurate 3D fruit counting in orchards. It utilizes adaptive-density Gaussian Splatting with radius-aware pruning and tile-based rasterization for scalable 3D representation. The framework incorporates language guidance by embedding CLIP-aligned semantic vectors in each Gaussian and using a dual-threshold cosine similarity mechanism for prompt filtering. This enables the selection of relevant Gaussians while suppressing distractions like foliage. The selected Gaussians are then clustered geometrically to estimate fruit instances, overcoming challenges like occlusion and viewpoint variation. FruitLangGS outperforms existing pipelines in fruit counting recall, achieving up to 99.7% recall on a specific orchard dataset. Ablation studies confirm the importance of language-conditioned semantic embedding and dual-threshold prompt filtering for accurate counting under occlusion. The framework has the potential for prompt-driven 3D semantic retrieval without retraining, demonstrating the value of language-guided 3D perception in agricultural scene understanding. 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.01109v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate 3D fruit counting in orchards is challenging due to heavy occlusion, semantic ambiguity between fruits and surrounding structures, and the high computational cost of volumetric reconstruction. Existing pipelines often rely on multi-view 2D segmentation and dense volumetric sampling, which lead to accumulated fusion errors and slow inference. We introduce FruitLangGS, a language-guided 3D fruit counting framework that reconstructs orchard-scale scenes using an adaptive-density Gaussian Splatting pipeline with radius-aware pruning and tile-based rasterization, enabling scalable 3D representation. During inference, compressed CLIP-aligned semantic vectors embedded in each Gaussian are filtered via a dual-threshold cosine similarity mechanism, retrieving Gaussians relevant to target prompts while suppressing common distractors (e.g., foliage), without requiring retraining or image-space masks. The selected Gaussians are then sampled into dense point clouds and clustered geometrically to estimate fruit instances, remaining robust under severe occlusion and viewpoint variation. Experiments on nine different orchard-scale datasets demonstrate that FruitLangGS consistently outperforms existing pipelines in instance counting recall, avoiding multi-view segmentation fusion errors and achieving up to 99.7% recall on Pfuji-Size_Orch2018 orchard dataset. Ablation studies further confirm that language-conditioned semantic embedding and dual-threshold prompt filtering are essential for suppressing distractors and improving counting accuracy under heavy occlusion. Beyond fruit counting, the same framework enables prompt-driven 3D semantic retrieval without retraining, highlighting the potential of language-guided 3D perception for scalable agricultural scene understanding.

<div> Keywords: Personalization, Large Language Models, User Preferences, Contextual Preferences, Interaction Sessions
Summary: 
Personalization of Large Language Models (LLMs) often assumes static user preferences across all tasks. However, humans have dynamic preferences that change with context. The CUPID benchmark evaluates LLMs' ability to infer and apply contextual preferences based on interaction histories. Results show that current LLMs struggle to accurately infer preferences and relevant context, with performance below 50% precision and 65% recall. This highlights the need to enhance LLM capabilities for more personalized interactions. CUPID serves as a valuable resource to drive improvements in contextually personalized responses.

Abstract: Personalization of Large Language Models (LLMs) often assumes users hold static preferences that reflect globally in all tasks. In reality, humans hold dynamic preferences that change depending on the context. As users interact with an LLM in various contexts, they naturally reveal their contextual preferences, which a model must infer and apply in future contexts to ensure alignment. To assess this, we introduce CUPID, a benchmark of 756 human-curated interaction session histories between users and LLM-based chat assistants. In each interaction session, the user provides a request in a specific context and expresses their preference through multi-turn feedback. Given a new user request and prior interaction sessions, our benchmark assesses whether LLMs can infer the preference relevant to this request and generate a response that satisfies this preference. With CUPID, we evaluated 10 open and proprietary LLMs, revealing that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to infer preferences from multi-turn interactions and fail to discern what previous context is relevant to a new request -- under 50% precision and 65% recall. Our work highlights the need to advance LLM capabilities for more contextually personalized interactions and proposes CUPID as a resource to drive these improvements.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces VLM4D, a benchmark designed to assess VLMs' spatiotemporal reasoning abilities. It emphasizes dynamic interactions like object movements, rotations, and perspective shifts crucial for real-world understanding. Current VLMs struggle with integrating visual cues and maintaining temporal coherence, falling short compared to human baselines. Promising directions like 4D feature field reconstruction and supervised spatiotemporal fine-tuning show potential in enhancing spatiotemporal comprehension. The benchmark comprises diverse videos with question-answer pairs to evaluate translational and rotational motions, perspective awareness, and motion continuity. The aim is to encourage research in improving VLMs' spatial and temporal grounding for better visual intelligence in dynamic environments. <div>

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in integrating linguistic and visual reasoning but remain fundamentally limited in understanding dynamic spatiotemporal interactions. Humans effortlessly track and reason about object movements, rotations, and perspective shifts-abilities essential for robust dynamic real-world understanding yet notably lacking in current VLMs. In this paper, we introduce VLM4D, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Our benchmark comprises diverse real-world and synthetic videos accompanied by carefully curated question-answer pairs emphasizing translational and rotational motions, perspective awareness, and motion continuity. Through comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art open and closed-source VLMs, we identify significant performance gaps compared to human baselines, highlighting fundamental deficiencies in existing models. Extensive analysis reveals that VLMs struggle particularly with integrating multiple visual cues and maintaining temporal coherence. We further explore promising directions, such as leveraging 4D feature field reconstruction and targeted spatiotemporal supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating their effectiveness in enhancing spatiotemporal comprehension. Our work aims to encourage deeper exploration into improving VLMs' spatial and temporal grounding, paving the way towards more capable and reliable visual intelligence for dynamic environments.

<div> Generative modeling, high-frequency limit order book, byte streams, market dynamics, autoregressive prediction<br />
Summary:<br />
ByteGen is a novel generative model for high-frequency limit order book dynamics that operates directly on raw byte streams. It uses a compact 32-byte binary format to represent market messages without information loss, eliminating the need for feature engineering and tokenization. The model, based on the H-Net architecture, successfully reproduces key financial market characteristics like realistic price distributions and bursty event timing. Trained on CME Bitcoin futures data, ByteGen achieves competitive performance on market quality metrics without the biases of tokenization. This approach represents a promising paradigm for modeling complex financial systems by learning directly from byte space. <div>
arXiv:2508.02247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative modeling of high-frequency limit order book (LOB) dynamics is a critical yet unsolved challenge in quantitative finance, essential for robust market simulation and strategy backtesting. Existing approaches are often constrained by simplifying stochastic assumptions or, in the case of modern deep learning models like Transformers, rely on tokenization schemes that affect the high-precision, numerical nature of financial data through discretization and binning. To address these limitations, we introduce ByteGen, a novel generative model that operates directly on the raw byte streams of LOB events. Our approach treats the problem as an autoregressive next-byte prediction task, for which we design a compact and efficient 32-byte packed binary format to represent market messages without information loss. The core novelty of our work is the complete elimination of feature engineering and tokenization, enabling the model to learn market dynamics from its most fundamental representation. We achieve this by adapting the H-Net architecture, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer model that uses a dynamic chunking mechanism to discover the inherent structure of market messages without predefined rules. Our primary contributions are: 1) the first end-to-end, byte-level framework for LOB modeling; 2) an efficient packed data representation; and 3) a comprehensive evaluation on high-frequency data. Trained on over 34 million events from CME Bitcoin futures, ByteGen successfully reproduces key stylized facts of financial markets, generating realistic price distributions, heavy-tailed returns, and bursty event timing. Our findings demonstrate that learning directly from byte space is a promising and highly flexible paradigm for modeling complex financial systems, achieving competitive performance on standard market quality metrics without the biases of tokenization.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven impressive progress in omni-modal understanding and generation. However, training omni-modal LLMs remains a significant challenge due to the heterogeneous model architectures required to process diverse modalities, necessitating sophisticated system design for efficient large-scale training. Existing frameworks typically entangle model definition with parallel logic, incurring limited scalability and substantial engineering overhead for end-to-end omni-modal training. We present VeOmni, a modular and efficient training framework to accelerate the development of omni-modal LLMs. VeOmni introduces model-centric distributed recipes that decouples communication from computation, enabling efficient 3D parallelism on omni-modal LLMs. VeOmni also features a flexible configuration interface supporting seamless integration of new modalities with minimal code change. Using VeOmni, a omni-modal mixture-of-experts (MoE) model with 30B parameters can be trained with over 2,800 tokens/sec/GPU throughput and scale to 160K context lengths via 3D parallelism on 128 GPUs, showcasing its superior efficiency and scalability for training large omni-modal LLMs.

Abstract: Industrial machinery maintenance requires timely intervention to prevent catastrophic failures and optimize operational efficiency. This paper presents an integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based intelligent system for prescriptive maintenance that extends beyond traditional anomaly detection to provide actionable maintenance recommendations. Building upon our prior LAMP framework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that combines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for intelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration data (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM processing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system classifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and assesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance manuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web searches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date maintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The Gemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes immediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts requirements, and timeline specifications. Experimental validation in bearing vibration datasets demonstrates effective anomaly detection and contextually relevant maintenance guidance. The system successfully bridges the gap between condition monitoring and actionable maintenance planning, providing industrial practitioners with intelligent decision support. This work advances the application of LLMs in industrial maintenance, offering a scalable framework for prescriptive maintenance across machinery components and industrial sectors.

Abstract: Adversarial board games, as a paradigmatic domain of strategic reasoning and intelligence, have long served as both a popular competitive activity and a benchmark for evaluating artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Building on this foundation, we propose an adversarial benchmarking framework to assess the comprehensive performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) through board games competition, compensating the limitation of data dependency of the mainstream Question-and-Answer (Q&amp;A) based benchmark method. We introduce Qi Town, a specialized evaluation platform that supports 5 widely played games and involves 20 LLM-driven players. The platform employs both the Elo rating system and a novel Performance Loop Graph (PLG) to quantitatively evaluate the technical capabilities of LLMs, while also capturing Positive Sentiment Score (PSS) throughout gameplay to assess mental fitness. The evaluation is structured as a round-robin tournament, enabling systematic comparison across players. Experimental results indicate that, despite technical differences, most LLMs remain optimistic about winning and losing, demonstrating greater adaptability to high-stress adversarial environments than humans. On the other hand, the complex relationship between cyclic wins and losses in PLGs exposes the instability of LLMs' skill play during games, warranting further explanation and exploration.

Abstract: Autonomous web-based geographical information systems (AWebGIS) aim to perform geospatial operations from natural language input, providing intuitive, intelligent, and hands-free interaction. However, most current solutions rely on cloud-based large language models (LLMs), which require continuous internet access and raise users' privacy and scalability issues due to centralized server processing. This study compares three approaches to enabling AWebGIS: (1) a fully-automated online method using cloud-based LLMs (e.g., Cohere); (2) a semi-automated offline method using classical machine learning classifiers such as support vector machine and random forest; and (3) a fully autonomous offline (client-side) method based on a fine-tuned small language model (SLM), specifically T5-small model, executed in the client's web browser. The third approach, which leverages SLMs, achieved the highest accuracy among all methods, with an exact matching accuracy of 0.93, Levenshtein similarity of 0.99, and recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L scores of 0.98. Crucially, this client-side computation strategy reduces the load on backend servers by offloading processing to the user's device, eliminating the need for server-based inference. These results highlight the feasibility of browser-executable models for AWebGIS solutions.

Summary:<br />
Reinforcement learning has been instrumental in enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models, but current benchmarks often overlook performance in realistic, non-ideal scenarios. This study identifies and evaluates three challenging scenarios - summary inference, fine-grained noise suppression, and contextual filtering. Testing three large language models and a vision-language model after RL fine-tuning reveals that while performance improves under idealized settings, there's a significant decline in non-ideal scenarios. Despite proposing specific remediation methods, the results suggest that current approaches do not effectively address reasoning deficits. This work emphasizes the need to assess large models under non-ideal conditions to accurately gauge their reasoning capabilities. The code and data for this study will be made available for further research.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key technique for enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), with policy-gradient algorithms dominating the post-training stage because of their efficiency and effectiveness. However, most existing benchmarks evaluate large-language-model reasoning under idealized settings, overlooking performance in realistic, non-ideal scenarios. We identify three representative non-ideal scenarios with practical relevance: summary inference, fine-grained noise suppression, and contextual filtering. We introduce a new research direction guided by brain-science findings that human reasoning remains reliable under imperfect inputs. We formally define and evaluate these challenging scenarios. We fine-tune three LLMs and a state-of-the-art large vision-language model (LVLM) using RL with a representative policy-gradient algorithm and then test their performance on eight public datasets. Our results reveal that while RL fine-tuning improves baseline reasoning under idealized settings, performance declines significantly across all three non-ideal scenarios, exposing critical limitations in advanced reasoning capabilities. Although we propose a scenario-specific remediation method, our results suggest current methods leave these reasoning deficits largely unresolved. This work highlights that the reasoning abilities of large models are often overstated and underscores the importance of evaluating models under non-ideal scenarios. The code and data will be released at XXXX.

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation: agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art agent frameworks. This work marks a necessary shift from building better tool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way for more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery.

Abstract: Molecular docking is a crucial aspect of drug discovery, as it predicts the binding interactions between small-molecule ligands and protein pockets. However, current multi-task learning models for docking often show inferior performance in ligand docking compared to protein pocket docking. This disparity arises largely due to the distinct structural complexities of ligands and proteins. To address this issue, we propose a novel game-theoretic framework that models the protein-ligand interaction as a two-player game called the Docking Game, with the ligand docking module acting as the ligand player and the protein pocket docking module as the protein player. To solve this game, we develop a novel Loop Self-Play (LoopPlay) algorithm, which alternately trains these players through a two-level loop. In the outer loop, the players exchange predicted poses, allowing each to incorporate the other's structural predictions, which fosters mutual adaptation over multiple iterations. In the inner loop, each player dynamically refines its predictions by incorporating its own predicted ligand or pocket poses back into its model. We theoretically show the convergence of LoopPlay, ensuring stable optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that LoopPlay achieves approximately a 10\% improvement in predicting accurate binding modes compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. This highlights its potential to enhance the accuracy of molecular docking in drug discovery.

<div> Keywords: large language models, spatial data integration, spatial reasoning, review-and-refine method, adaptive integration

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) are investigated for spatial data integration, aiming to empower domain experts in handling large, diverse, and noisy urban spatial datasets. Traditional rule-based methods have limitations in covering all cases, while machine learning approaches require extensive data labeling. The study shows that LLMs possess spatial reasoning abilities but struggle in connecting macro-scale environments with computational geometry tasks. By reducing reliance on spatial reasoning and providing relevant features, LLMs achieve high-performance results. A review-and-refine method is successfully employed to correct initial errors while maintaining accuracy. Practical implications for real-world spatial data integration are discussed, along with future research directions like post-training techniques and support for diverse data formats. Overall, the findings suggest that LLMs offer a promising and flexible alternative to conventional rule-based methods, enhancing adaptive spatial data integration capabilities.

Abstract: We explore the application of large language models (LLMs) to empower domain experts in integrating large, heterogeneous, and noisy urban spatial datasets. Traditional rule-based integration methods are unable to cover all edge cases, requiring manual verification and repair. Machine learning approaches require collecting and labeling of large numbers of task-specific samples. In this study, we investigate the potential of LLMs for spatial data integration. Our analysis first considers how LLMs reason about environmental spatial relationships mediated by human experience, such as between roads and sidewalks. We show that while LLMs exhibit spatial reasoning capabilities, they struggle to connect the macro-scale environment with the relevant computational geometry tasks, often producing logically incoherent responses. But when provided relevant features, thereby reducing dependence on spatial reasoning, LLMs are able to generate high-performing results. We then adapt a review-and-refine method, which proves remarkably effective in correcting erroneous initial responses while preserving accurate responses. We discuss practical implications of employing LLMs for spatial data integration in real-world contexts and outline future research directions, including post-training, multi-modal integration methods, and support for diverse data formats. Our findings position LLMs as a promising and flexible alternative to traditional rule-based heuristics, advancing the capabilities of adaptive spatial data integration.

Abstract: Web navigation represents a critical and challenging domain for evaluating artificial general intelligence (AGI), demanding complex decision-making within high-entropy, dynamic environments with combinatorially explosive action spaces. Current approaches to building autonomous web agents either focus on offline imitation learning or online exploration, but rarely integrate both paradigms effectively. Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition, we derive a principled decomposition into fast System 1 and slow System 2 cognitive processes. This decomposition provides a unifying perspective on existing web agent methodologies, bridging the gap between offline learning of intuitive reactive behaviors and online acquisition of deliberative planning capabilities. We implement this framework in CogniWeb, a modular agent architecture that adaptively toggles between fast intuitive processing and deliberate reasoning based on task complexity. Our evaluation on WebArena demonstrates that CogniWeb achieves competitive performance (43.96% success rate) while maintaining significantly higher efficiency (75% reduction in token usage).

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly improved medical AI, enabling it to unify the understanding of visual and textual information. However, as medical knowledge continues to evolve, it is critical to allow these models to efficiently update outdated or incorrect information without retraining from scratch. Although textual knowledge editing has been widely studied, there is still a lack of systematic benchmarks for multimodal medical knowledge editing involving image and text modalities. To fill this gap, we present MedMKEB, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the reliability, generality, locality, portability, and robustness of knowledge editing in medical multimodal large language models. MedMKEB is built on a high-quality medical visual question-answering dataset and enriched with carefully constructed editing tasks, including counterfactual correction, semantic generalization, knowledge transfer, and adversarial robustness. We incorporate human expert validation to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the benchmark. Extensive single editing and sequential editing experiments on state-of-the-art general and medical MLLMs demonstrate the limitations of existing knowledge-based editing approaches in medicine, highlighting the need to develop specialized editing strategies. MedMKEB will serve as a standard benchmark to promote the development of trustworthy and efficient medical knowledge editing algorithms.

<div> Keywords: Analog circuit design, gate sizing, Large Language Models, Differential Evolution, Particle Swarm Optimization

Summary: 
Analog circuit design is a complex and time-consuming task requiring significant expertise. Current AI approaches for gate sizing in analog circuits face challenges in generalizability and portability across different technology nodes. EasySize is introduced as a lightweight gate sizing framework based on a finetuned Qwen3-8B model, offering universal applicability across various process nodes, design specifications, and circuit topologies. Utilizing the concept of Ease of Attainability (EOA) of performance metrics, EasySize dynamically constructs task-specific loss functions, optimizing through global Differential Evolution (DE) and local Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) within a feedback-enhanced flow. Despite being trained only on 350nm node data, EasySize demonstrates strong performance on Op-Amp netlists across 180nm, 45nm, and 22nm nodes. Outperforming existing methods like AutoCkt, EasySize reduces the reliance on human expertise and computational resources in gate sizing, streamlining the analog circuit design process. EasySize will be released as an open-source tool in the future.

Abstract: Analog circuit design is a time-consuming, experience-driven task in chip development. Despite advances in AI, developing universal, fast, and stable gate sizing methods for analog circuits remains a significant challenge. Recent approaches combine Large Language Models (LLMs) with heuristic search techniques to enhance generalizability, but they often depend on large model sizes and lack portability across different technology nodes. To overcome these limitations, we propose EasySize, the first lightweight gate sizing framework based on a finetuned Qwen3-8B model, designed for universal applicability across process nodes, design specifications, and circuit topologies. EasySize exploits the varying Ease of Attainability (EOA) of performance metrics to dynamically construct task-specific loss functions, enabling efficient heuristic search through global Differential Evolution (DE) and local Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) within a feedback-enhanced flow. Although finetuned solely on 350nm node data, EasySize achieves strong performance on 5 operational amplifier (Op-Amp) netlists across 180nm, 45nm, and 22nm technology nodes without additional targeted training, and outperforms AutoCkt, a widely-used Reinforcement Learning based sizing framework, on 86.67\% of tasks with more than 96.67\% of simulation resources reduction. We argue that EasySize can significantly reduce the reliance on human expertise and computational resources in gate sizing, thereby accelerating and simplifying the analog circuit design process. EasySize will be open-sourced at a later date.

This study evaluates the impact of a Socratic AI Tutor on student research question development. It compares the benefits of using a structured dialogue model against an uninstructed AI chatbot. Results show that students using the Socratic Tutor exhibit greater support for critical, independent, and reflective thinking. This challenges the notion of de-skilling due to generative AI use. The study introduces the concept of orchestrated Multi-agent systems (MAS) for educational purposes, suggesting a pedagogical shift towards AI-assisted learning. The proposed model involves educators curating specialized AI agents to support diverse learning paths. The paper also discusses system-level implications for higher education institutions and students, including changes in funding, faculty roles, curricular design, competencies, and assessment practices. Additionally, a cost-effectiveness analysis highlights the scalability of such systems.

Abstract: Generative AI is no longer a peripheral tool in higher education. It is rapidly evolving into a general-purpose infrastructure that reshapes how knowledge is generated, mediated, and validated. This paper presents findings from a controlled experiment evaluating a Socratic AI Tutor, a large language model designed to scaffold student research question development through structured dialogue grounded in constructivist theory. Conducted with 65 pre-service teacher students in Germany, the study compares interaction with the Socratic Tutor to engagement with an uninstructed AI chatbot. Students using the Socratic Tutor reported significantly greater support for critical, independent, and reflective thinking, suggesting that dialogic AI can stimulate metacognitive engagement and challenging recent narratives of de-skilling due to generative AI usage. These findings serve as a proof of concept for a broader pedagogical shift: the use of multi-agent systems (MAS) composed of specialised AI agents. To conceptualise this, we introduce the notion of orchestrated MAS, modular, pedagogically aligned agent constellations, curated by educators, that support diverse learning trajectories through differentiated roles and coordinated interaction. To anchor this shift, we propose an adapted offer-and-use model, in which students appropriate instructional offers from these agents. Beyond technical feasibility, we examine system-level implications for higher education institutions and students, including funding necessities, changes to faculty roles, curriculars, competencies and assessment practices. We conclude with a comparative cost-effectiveness analysis highlighting the scalability of such systems. In sum, this study contributes both empirical evidence and a conceptual roadmap for hybrid learning ecosystems that embed human-AI co-agency and pedagogical alignment.

<div> Graph Neural Networks, Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks, Event Logs, Process Mining, Trace Reconstruction<br />
Summary:<br />
The article discusses the importance of high-quality event logs in Process Mining analysis and the challenges of dealing with missing information in real-world event logs. Traditional approaches involve using process models or machine learning models for trace reconstruction. The focus of this work is on developing a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network model that can fill in missing attributes in incomplete events in traces. The model is evaluated on synthetic and real event logs and outperforms existing model-free approaches by effectively reconstructing all event attributes. This approach offers a more expressive and semantically rich encoding of complex multi-modal sequences like execution traces in Process Mining. <div>
arXiv:2508.05145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quality of event logs in Process Mining is crucial when applying any form of analysis to them. In real-world event logs, the acquisition of data can be non-trivial (e.g., due to the execution of manual activities and related manual recording or to issues in collecting, for each event, all its attributes), and often may end up with events recorded with some missing information. Standard approaches to the problem of trace (or log) reconstruction either require the availability of a process model that is used to fill missing values by leveraging different reasoning techniques or employ a Machine Learning/Deep Learning model to restore the missing values by learning from similar cases. In recent years, a new type of Deep Learning model that is capable of handling input data encoded as graphs has emerged, namely Graph Neural Networks. Graph Neural Network models, and even more so Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks, offer the advantage of working with a more natural representation of complex multi-modal sequences like the execution traces in Process Mining, allowing for more expressive and semantically rich encodings.
  In this work, we focus on the development of a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network model that, given a trace containing some incomplete events, will return the full set of attributes missing from those events. We evaluate our work against a state-of-the-art approach leveraging autoencoders on two synthetic logs and four real event logs, on different types of missing values. Different from state-of-the-art model-free approaches, which mainly focus on repairing a subset of event attributes, the proposed approach shows very good performance in reconstructing all different event attributes.

Summary: <br />
QA-Dragon is a Query-Aware Dynamic RAG System for Knowledge-Intensive Visual Question Answering. It addresses the limitations of existing RAG methods by incorporating domain-specific reasoning and dynamically selecting optimal retrieval strategies. By combining text and image search agents in a hybrid setup, QA-Dragon supports multimodal, multi-turn, and multi-hop reasoning for complex VQA tasks. The system significantly enhances reasoning performance in the Meta CRAG-MM Challenge, outperforming baselines on single-source, multi-source, and multi-turn tasks. QA-Dragon achieves substantial improvements in answer accuracy and knowledge overlap scores, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling complex queries and up-to-date factual knowledge. <div>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been introduced to mitigate hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating external knowledge into the generation process, and it has become a widely adopted approach for knowledge-intensive Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, existing RAG methods typically retrieve from either text or images in isolation, limiting their ability to address complex queries that require multi-hop reasoning or up-to-date factual knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose QA-Dragon, a Query-Aware Dynamic RAG System for Knowledge-Intensive VQA. Specifically, QA-Dragon introduces a domain router to identify the query's subject domain for domain-specific reasoning, along with a search router that dynamically selects optimal retrieval strategies. By orchestrating both text and image search agents in a hybrid setup, our system supports multimodal, multi-turn, and multi-hop reasoning, enabling it to tackle complex VQA tasks effectively. We evaluate our QA-Dragon on the Meta CRAG-MM Challenge at KDD Cup 2025, where it significantly enhances the reasoning performance of base models under challenging scenarios. Our framework achieves substantial improvements in both answer accuracy and knowledge overlap scores, outperforming baselines by 5.06% on the single-source task, 6.35% on the multi-source task, and 5.03% on the multi-turn task.

Unlike previous methods that loosely integrate symbolic and neural modules, this approach embeds decision trees and random forests as callable oracles in a unified reasoning system.

Abstract: We propose a hybrid architecture that integrates decision tree-based symbolic reasoning with the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) within a coordinated multi-agent framework. Unlike prior approaches that loosely couple symbolic and neural modules, our design embeds decision trees and random forests as callable oracles within a unified reasoning system. Tree-based modules enable interpretable rule inference and causal logic, while LLM agents handle abductive reasoning, generalization, and interactive planning. A central orchestrator maintains belief state consistency and mediates communication across agents and external tools, enabling reasoning over both structured and unstructured inputs.
  The system achieves strong performance on reasoning benchmarks. On \textit{ProofWriter}, it improves entailment consistency by +7.2\% through logic-grounded tree validation. On GSM8k, it achieves +5.3\% accuracy gains in multistep mathematical problems via symbolic augmentation. On \textit{ARC}, it boosts abstraction accuracy by +6.0\% through integration of symbolic oracles. Applications in clinical decision support and scientific discovery show how the system encodes domain rules symbolically while leveraging LLMs for contextual inference and hypothesis generation. This architecture offers a robust, interpretable, and extensible solution for general-purpose neuro-symbolic reasoning.

Abstract: The term 'agent' in artificial intelligence has long carried multiple interpretations across different subfields. Recent developments in AI capabilities, particularly in large language model systems, have amplified this ambiguity, creating significant challenges in research communication, system evaluation and reproducibility, and policy development. This paper argues that the term 'agent' requires redefinition. Drawing from historical analysis and contemporary usage patterns, we propose a framework that defines clear minimum requirements for a system to be considered an agent while characterizing systems along a multidimensional spectrum of environmental interaction, learning and adaptation, autonomy, goal complexity, and temporal coherence. This approach provides precise vocabulary for system description while preserving the term's historically multifaceted nature. After examining potential counterarguments and implementation challenges, we provide specific recommendations for moving forward as a field, including suggestions for terminology standardization and framework adoption. The proposed approach offers practical tools for improving research clarity and reproducibility while supporting more effective policy development.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have extended their capabilities from basic text processing to complex reasoning tasks, including legal interpretation, argumentation, and strategic interaction. However, empirical understanding of LLM behavior in open-ended, multi-agent settings especially those involving deliberation over legal and ethical dilemmas remains limited. We introduce NomicLaw, a structured multi-agent simulation where LLMs engage in collaborative law-making, responding to complex legal vignettes by proposing rules, justifying them, and voting on peer proposals. We quantitatively measure trust and reciprocity via voting patterns and qualitatively assess how agents use strategic language to justify proposals and influence outcomes. Experiments involving homogeneous and heterogeneous LLM groups demonstrate how agents spontaneously form alliances, betray trust, and adapt their rhetoric to shape collective decisions. Our results highlight the latent social reasoning and persuasive capabilities of ten open-source LLMs and provide insights into the design of future AI systems capable of autonomous negotiation, coordination and drafting legislation in legal settings.

<div> Undecidability, Description Logics, Minimal Models, Concept Satisfiability, Acyclicity
Summary:
Undecidability of concept satisfiability in minimal models within Description Logics, specifically $\mathcal{EL}$, has been proven. This result extends to a limited fragment of tuple-generating dependencies. Imposing acyclicity conditions on the TBox reduces worst-case complexity to below double exponential time, connecting with pointwise circumscription. The article also addresses data complexity in these contexts. In the DL-Lite family, ExpSpace-hardness is established for DL-Lite$_{\text{horn}}$, building on a previously known positive result for DL-Lite$_{\text{core}}. The study provides insights into reasoning with minimal models in Description Logics and highlights the challenges and complexities involved. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.05350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning with minimal models has always been at the core of many knowledge representation techniques, but we still have only a limited understanding of this problem in Description Logics (DLs). Minimization of some selected predicates, letting the remaining predicates vary or be fixed, as proposed in circumscription, has been explored and exhibits high complexity. The case of `pure' minimal models, where the extension of all predicates must be minimal, has remained largely uncharted. We address this problem in popular DLs and obtain surprisingly negative results: concept satisfiability in minimal models is undecidable already for $\mathcal{EL}$. This undecidability also extends to a very restricted fragment of tuple-generating dependencies. To regain decidability, we impose acyclicity conditions on the TBox that bring the worst-case complexity below double exponential time and allow us to establish a connection with the recently studied pointwise circumscription; we also derive results in data complexity. We conclude with a brief excursion to the DL-Lite family, where a positive result was known for DL-Lite$_{\text{core}}$, but our investigation establishes ExpSpace-hardness already for its extension DL-Lite$_{\text{horn}}$.

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language Models often struggle with complex, multi-question reasoning tasks where partial correctness is crucial for effective learning. Traditional reward mechanisms, which provide a single binary score for an entire response, are too coarse to guide models through intricate problems with multiple sub-parts. To address this, we introduce StructVRM, a method that aligns multimodal reasoning with Structured and Verifiable Reward Models. At its core is a model-based verifier trained to provide fine-grained, sub-question-level feedback, assessing semantic and mathematical equivalence rather than relying on rigid string matching. This allows for nuanced, partial credit scoring in previously intractable problem formats. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of StructVRM. Our trained model, Seed-StructVRM, achieves state-of-the-art performance on six out of twelve public multimodal benchmarks and our newly curated, high-difficulty STEM-Bench. The success of StructVRM validates that training with structured, verifiable rewards is a highly effective approach for advancing the capabilities of multimodal models in complex, real-world reasoning domains.

Abstract: This work contributes to a real-time data-driven predictive maintenance solution for Intelligent Transportation Systems. The proposed method implements a processing pipeline comprised of sample pre-processing, incremental classification with Machine Learning models, and outcome explanation. This novel online processing pipeline has two main highlights: (i) a dedicated sample pre-processing module, which builds statistical and frequency-related features on the fly, and (ii) an explainability module. This work is the first to perform online fault prediction with natural language and visual explainability. The experiments were performed with the MetroPT data set from the metro operator of Porto, Portugal. The results are above 98 % for F-measure and 99 % for accuracy. In the context of railway predictive maintenance, achieving these high values is crucial due to the practical and operational implications of accurate failure prediction. In the specific case of a high F-measure, this ensures that the system maintains an optimal balance between detecting the highest possible number of real faults and minimizing false alarms, which is crucial for maximizing service availability. Furthermore, the accuracy obtained enables reliability, directly impacting cost reduction and increased safety. The analysis demonstrates that the pipeline maintains high performance even in the presence of class imbalance and noise, and its explanations effectively reflect the decision-making process. These findings validate the methodological soundness of the approach and confirm its practical applicability for supporting proactive maintenance decisions in real-world railway operations. Therefore, by identifying the early signs of failure, this pipeline enables decision-makers to understand the underlying problems and act accordingly swiftly.

<br />Summary: Vision Language Models (VLMs) excel in perception and visual reasoning but struggle with precise action planning. DeepPHY is introduced to assess VLMs' understanding of physics principles through challenging simulated environments. Tasks in real-world scenarios require complex interactions, spatial reasoning, long-term planning, and strategy refinement. DeepPHY evaluates VLMs' ability to apply physical knowledge accurately for predictive control. Despite advances in VLMs, they face difficulties in precise control based on descriptive physical understanding. <div>

Abstract: Although Vision Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong perceptual abilities and impressive visual reasoning, they struggle with attention to detail and precise action planning in complex, dynamic environments, leading to subpar performance. Real-world tasks typically require complex interactions, advanced spatial reasoning, long-term planning, and continuous strategy refinement, usually necessitating understanding the physics rules of the target scenario. However, evaluating these capabilities in real-world scenarios is often prohibitively expensive. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepPHY, a novel benchmark framework designed to systematically evaluate VLMs' understanding and reasoning about fundamental physical principles through a series of challenging simulated environments. DeepPHY integrates multiple physical reasoning environments of varying difficulty levels and incorporates fine-grained evaluation metrics. Our evaluation finds that even state-of-the-art VLMs struggle to translate descriptive physical knowledge into precise, predictive control.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are beginning to reshape how chemists plan and run reactions in organic synthesis. Trained on millions of reported transformations, these text-based models can propose synthetic routes, forecast reaction outcomes and even instruct robots that execute experiments without human supervision. Here we survey the milestones that turned LLMs from speculative tools into practical lab partners. We show how coupling LLMs with graph neural networks, quantum calculations and real-time spectroscopy shrinks discovery cycles and supports greener, data-driven chemistry. We discuss limitations, including biased datasets, opaque reasoning and the need for safety gates that prevent unintentional hazards.

Summary: The article discusses the importance of considering geographic variability in AI alignment, as societal norms and goals can differ significantly across regions. It highlights how alignment measures may produce outcomes that deviate from statistical realities, such as gender ratios in images. The paper emphasizes the need for spatio-temporally aware alignment approaches in the era of Agentic AI, where AI systems mediate knowledge and opinions on a global scale. It raises concerns about the lack of transparency in how context is managed by AI systems and suggests future research topics and methods for assessing alignment sensitivity. <div>

Abstract: AI (super) alignment describes the challenge of ensuring (future) AI systems behave in accordance with societal norms and goals. While a quickly evolving literature is addressing biases and inequalities, the geographic variability of alignment remains underexplored. Simply put, what is considered appropriate, truthful, or legal can differ widely across regions due to cultural norms, political realities, and legislation. Alignment measures applied to AI/ML workflows can sometimes produce outcomes that diverge from statistical realities, such as text-to-image models depicting balanced gender ratios in company leadership despite existing imbalances. Crucially, some model outputs are globally acceptable, while others, e.g., questions about Kashmir, depend on knowing the user's location and their context. This geographic sensitivity is not new. For instance, Google Maps renders Kashmir's borders differently based on user location. What is new is the unprecedented scale and automation with which AI now mediates knowledge, expresses opinions, and represents geographic reality to millions of users worldwide, often with little transparency about how context is managed. As we approach Agentic AI, the need for spatio-temporally aware alignment, rather than one-size-fits-all approaches, is increasingly urgent. This paper reviews key geographic research problems, suggests topics for future work, and outlines methods for assessing alignment sensitivity.

<div> Keywords: General Purpose AI, Evaluation, Benchmark-regulation gap, EU AI Act, Systemic risks

Summary:
The research addresses the need for robust evaluation frameworks in the rapidly advancing field of General Purpose AI (GPAI), particularly in light of emerging regulations like the EU AI Act. The study introduces the Bench-2-CoP framework, which evaluates how well widely-used benchmarks align with the capabilities and propensities outlined in the EU AI Act. The analysis reveals a significant gap in the evaluation ecosystem, with a focus on narrow behavioral propensities and a lack of coverage for critical functional capabilities related to loss-of-control scenarios. Key capabilities such as evading human oversight, self-replication, and autonomous AI development receive zero coverage in current benchmarks, leading to near-total evaluation gaps for systemic risks like Loss of Control and Cyber Offence. The findings offer valuable insights for policymakers to enhance the Code of Practice (CoP) and for developers to create more comprehensive evaluation tools for safer and compliant AI systems.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of General Purpose AI (GPAI) models necessitates robust evaluation frameworks, especially with emerging regulations like the EU AI Act and its associated Code of Practice (CoP). Current AI evaluation practices depend heavily on established benchmarks, but these tools were not designed to measure the systemic risks that are the focus of the new regulatory landscape. This research addresses the urgent need to quantify this "benchmark-regulation gap." We introduce Bench-2-CoP, a novel, systematic framework that uses validated LLM-as-judge analysis to map the coverage of 194,955 questions from widely-used benchmarks against the EU AI Act's taxonomy of model capabilities and propensities. Our findings reveal a profound misalignment: the evaluation ecosystem is overwhelmingly focused on a narrow set of behavioral propensities, such as "Tendency to hallucinate" (53.7% of the corpus) and "Discriminatory bias" (28.9%), while critical functional capabilities are dangerously neglected. Crucially, capabilities central to loss-of-control scenarios, including evading human oversight, self-replication, and autonomous AI development, receive zero coverage in the entire benchmark corpus. This translates to a near-total evaluation gap for systemic risks like "Loss of Control" (0.4% coverage) and "Cyber Offence" (0.8% coverage). This study provides the first comprehensive, quantitative analysis of this gap, offering critical insights for policymakers to refine the CoP and for developers to build the next generation of evaluation tools, ultimately fostering safer and more compliant AI.

<div> Keywords: Emotion recognition, Conversations, Machine intelligence, Large Language Models, Datasets <br />
Summary: 
- Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) is crucial for advancing machine intelligence.
- Existing ERC datasets are limited and face challenges such as bias and subjectivity in labels.
- A small, resource-efficient LLM is used to synthesize six novel ERC datasets to supplement existing benchmarks.

- Experimental results show that models trained on the generated datasets exhibit robustness and significant performance improvements on existing ERC benchmarks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.05474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) focuses on identifying emotion shifts within interactions, representing a significant step toward advancing machine intelligence. However, ERC data remains scarce, and existing datasets face numerous challenges due to their highly biased sources and the inherent subjectivity of soft labels. Even though Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their quality in many affective tasks, they are typically expensive to train, and their application to ERC tasks--particularly in data generation--remains limited. To address these challenges, we employ a small, resource-efficient, and general-purpose LLM to synthesize ERC datasets with diverse properties, supplementing the three most widely used ERC benchmarks. We generate six novel datasets, with two tailored to enhance each benchmark. We evaluate the utility of these datasets to (1) supplement existing datasets for ERC classification, and (2) analyze the effects of label imbalance in ERC. Our experimental results indicate that ERC classifier models trained on the generated datasets exhibit strong robustness and consistently achieve statistically significant performance improvements on existing ERC benchmarks.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, post-training, sample efficiency, data curation, reasoning tasks

Summary: 
InfiAlign introduces a post-training framework combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align large language models for improved reasoning abilities. The framework utilizes a data selection pipeline to automatically curate high-quality alignment data from open-source reasoning datasets, resulting in significant performance gains while reducing data requirements. When applied to the Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base model, the SFT model achieves comparable performance to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B using only 12% of the training data. Integration of DPO further improves the model's performance, particularly in mathematical reasoning tasks, with an average improvement of 3.89% on AIME 24/25 benchmarks. This study demonstrates the efficacy of combining principled data selection with full-stage post-training to align large reasoning models in a scalable and data-efficient manner. The model checkpoints can be accessed at the provided link.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive reasoning abilities on a wide range of complex tasks. However, enhancing these capabilities through post-training remains resource intensive, particularly in terms of data and computational cost. Although recent efforts have sought to improve sample efficiency through selective data curation, existing methods often rely on heuristic or task-specific strategies that hinder scalability. In this work, we introduce InfiAlign, a scalable and sample-efficient post-training framework that integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align LLMs for enhanced reasoning. At the core of InfiAlign is a robust data selection pipeline that automatically curates high-quality alignment data from open-source reasoning datasets using multidimensional quality metrics. This pipeline enables significant performance gains while drastically reducing data requirements and remains extensible to new data sources. When applied to the Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base model, our SFT model achieves performance on par with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, while using only approximately 12% of the training data, and demonstrates strong generalization across diverse reasoning tasks. Additional improvements are obtained through the application of DPO, with particularly notable gains in mathematical reasoning tasks. The model achieves an average improvement of 3.89% on AIME 24/25 benchmarks. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining principled data selection with full-stage post-training, offering a practical solution for aligning large reasoning models in a scalable and data-efficient manner.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Knowledge Graphs, Reasoning, Interactive Learning

Summary: 
GRAIL is a framework designed to enhance retrieval-augmented reasoning by interacting with large-scale knowledge graphs. It integrates LLM-guided exploration with path filtering to generate fine-grained reasoning trajectories automatically. A two-stage training process helps learn a policy for optimal actions at each reasoning step. Process-supervised rewards aid in balancing precision and conciseness in graph retrieval, improving data efficiency and training stability. GRAIL adopts an interactive retrieval paradigm for autonomous exploration of graph paths with dynamic precision-breadth trade-offs. Experiment results demonstrate GRAIL's effectiveness, with significant accuracy and F1 score improvements on knowledge graph question-answering datasets. The source code and datasets are available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.05498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques have exhibited remarkable performance across a wide range of domains. However, existing RAG approaches primarily operate on unstructured data and demonstrate limited capability in handling structured knowledge such as knowledge graphs. Meanwhile, current graph retrieval methods fundamentally struggle to capture holistic graph structures while simultaneously facing precision control challenges that manifest as either critical information gaps or excessive redundant connections, collectively undermining reasoning performance. To address this challenge, we propose GRAIL: Graph-Retrieval Augmented Interactive Learning, a framework designed to interact with large-scale graphs for retrieval-augmented reasoning. Specifically, GRAIL integrates LLM-guided random exploration with path filtering to establish a data synthesis pipeline, where a fine-grained reasoning trajectory is automatically generated for each task. Based on the synthesized data, we then employ a two-stage training process to learn a policy that dynamically decides the optimal actions at each reasoning step. The overall objective of precision-conciseness balance in graph retrieval is decoupled into fine-grained process-supervised rewards to enhance data efficiency and training stability. In practical deployment, GRAIL adopts an interactive retrieval paradigm, enabling the model to autonomously explore graph paths while dynamically balancing retrieval breadth and precision. Extensive experiments have shown that GRAIL achieves an average accuracy improvement of 21.01% and F1 improvement of 22.43% on three knowledge graph question-answering datasets. Our source code and datasets is available at https://github.com/Changgeww/GRAIL.

Summary:
The article introduces a new generalizable and modular framework for evaluating agent task completion across various domains. This framework aims to mimic human-like evaluation by breaking tasks into sub-tasks and validating each step based on the agent's output and reasoning. Different modules contribute to the evaluation process, and their outputs are combined to provide a final assessment of task completion. The framework was tested on two benchmarks, GAIA and BigCodeBench, using the Magentic-One Actor Agent. Results showed that the proposed Judge Agent had higher alignment accuracy with human evaluations compared to the baseline LLM-as-a-Judge system. This study highlights the potential of the new evaluation framework in assessing agent performance in diverse domains. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.05508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing adoption of foundation models as agents across diverse domains necessitates a robust evaluation framework. Current methods, such as LLM-as-a-Judge, focus only on final outputs, overlooking the step-by-step reasoning that drives agentic decision-making. Meanwhile, existing Agent-as-a-Judge systems, where one agent evaluates another's task completion, are typically designed for narrow, domain-specific settings. To address this gap, we propose a generalizable, modular framework for evaluating agent task completion independent of the task domain. The framework emulates human-like evaluation by decomposing tasks into sub-tasks and validating each step using available information, such as the agent's output and reasoning. Each module contributes to a specific aspect of the evaluation process, and their outputs are aggregated to produce a final verdict on task completion. We validate our framework by evaluating the Magentic-One Actor Agent on two benchmarks, GAIA and BigCodeBench. Our Judge Agent predicts task success with closer agreement to human evaluations, achieving 4.76% and 10.52% higher alignment accuracy, respectively, compared to the GPT-4o based LLM-as-a-Judge baseline. This demonstrates the potential of our proposed general-purpose evaluation framework.

Summary: 
The article presents MV-Debate, a framework for detecting harmful content in the complex multimodal environment of social media. The framework utilizes four debate agents to analyze content from different perspectives: surface analysis, deep reasoning, modality contrast, and social context.

Abstract: Social media has evolved into a complex multimodal environment where text, images, and other signals interact to shape nuanced meanings, often concealing harmful intent. Identifying such intent, whether sarcasm, hate speech, or misinformation, remains challenging due to cross-modal contradictions, rapid cultural shifts, and subtle pragmatic cues. To address these challenges, we propose MV-Debate, a multi-view agent debate framework with dynamic reflection gating for unified multimodal harmful content detection. MV-Debate assembles four complementary debate agents, a surface analyst, a deep reasoner, a modality contrast, and a social contextualist, to analyze content from diverse interpretive perspectives. Through iterative debate and reflection, the agents refine responses under a reflection-gain criterion, ensuring both accuracy and efficiency. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MV-Debate significantly outperforms strong single-model and existing multi-agent debate baselines. This work highlights the promise of multi-agent debate in advancing reliable social intent detection in safety-critical online contexts.

<div> Active Inference, autonomous AI agents, learning from experience, intrinsic drive, Large Language Models
<br />
Summary: This paper argues that Active Inference (AIF) can enable autonomous AI agents to learn from experience without the need for continuous human reward engineering. Current AI systems face scalability challenges as they rely on human-designed rewards. The proposed "Era of Experience" suggests agents learn from self-generated data, but still require human input for reward functions. The grounded-agency gap is identified as the inability of AI systems to autonomously formulate and pursue objectives. AIF can bridge this gap by using intrinsic drive to minimize free energy, allowing agents to balance exploration and exploitation. Integrating Large Language Models with AIF can create agents that efficiently learn from experience while aligned with human values. This synthesis offers a pathway to developing autonomous AI systems within computational and physical constraints.

Abstract: This paper argues that Active Inference (AIF) provides a crucial foundation for developing autonomous AI agents capable of learning from experience without continuous human reward engineering. As AI systems begin to exhaust high-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for reward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges that could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The proposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated data, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on extensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the bottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we identify as the \textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI systems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to changing circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing external reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy, allowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a unified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative world models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create agents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with human values. This synthesis offers a compelling path toward AI systems that can develop autonomously while adhering to both computational and physical constraints.

<div> Keywords: deep learning, human learning behavior, multi-agent framework, cognitive growth, simulation experiments

Summary:
Longitudinal analysis of the LearnerAgent framework reveals that only the Deep Learner achieves sustained cognitive growth, while trap questions effectively diagnose the Surface Learner's shallow knowledge. The behavioral and cognitive patterns of distinct learners align closely with their psychological profiles, and learners' self-concept scores evolve realistically. Interestingly, the General Learner develops high self-efficacy despite cognitive limitations. The base LLM defaults to a "diligent but brittle Surface Learner" behavior, mimicking good student actions but lacking true understanding. Simulation experiments demonstrate that LearnerAgent provides insightful findings about LLM behavior in realistic scenarios.

arXiv:2508.05622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capturing human learning behavior based on deep learning methods has become a major research focus in both psychology and intelligent systems. Recent approaches rely on controlled experiments or rule-based models to explore cognitive processes. However, they struggle to capture learning dynamics, track progress over time, or provide explainability. To address these challenges, we introduce LearnerAgent, a novel multi-agent framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate a realistic teaching environment. To explore human-like learning dynamics, we construct learners with psychologically grounded profiles-such as Deep, Surface, and Lazy-as well as a persona-free General Learner to inspect the base LLM's default behavior. Through weekly knowledge acquisition, monthly strategic choices, periodic tests, and peer interaction, we can track the dynamic learning progress of individual learners over a full-year journey. Our findings are fourfold: 1) Longitudinal analysis reveals that only Deep Learner achieves sustained cognitive growth. Our specially designed "trap questions" effectively diagnose Surface Learner's shallow knowledge. 2) The behavioral and cognitive patterns of distinct learners align closely with their psychological profiles. 3) Learners' self-concept scores evolve realistically, with the General Learner developing surprisingly high self-efficacy despite its cognitive limitations. 4) Critically, the default profile of base LLM is a "diligent but brittle Surface Learner"-an agent that mimics the behaviors of a good student but lacks true, generalizable understanding. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that LearnerAgent aligns well with real scenarios, yielding more insightful findings about LLMs' behavior.

Abstract: We have devised an artificial intelligence algorithm with machine reinforcement learning (Q-learning) to construct remarkable entangled states with 4 qubits. This way, the algorithm is able to generate representative states for some of the 49 true SLOCC classes of the four-qubit entanglement states. In particular, it is possible to reach at least one true SLOCC class for each of the nine entanglement families. The quantum circuits synthesized by the algorithm may be useful for the experimental realization of these important classes of entangled states and to draw conclusions about the intrinsic properties of our universe. We introduce a graphical tool called the state-link graph (SLG) to represent the construction of the Quality matrix (Q-matrix) used by the algorithm to build a given objective state belonging to the corresponding entanglement class. This allows us to discover the necessary connections between specific entanglement features and the role of certain quantum gates that the algorithm needs to include in the quantum gate set of actions. The quantum circuits found are optimal by construction with respect to the quantum gate-set chosen. These SLGs make the algorithm simple, intuitive and a useful resource for the automated construction of entangled states with a low number of qubits.

<div> Language Models, Traceability, Documentation, Source Code, Evaluation

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) are evaluated for establishing trace links between software documentation and source code. The study uses two open-source projects to assess trace link identification accuracy, relationship explanation quality, and multi-step chain reconstruction. The best-performing LLM achieves high F1-scores, outperforming baselines like TF-IDF and CodeBERT. While correct relationship explanations vary, partial accuracy is high, indicating fundamental connections are rarely missed. LLMs display high endpoint accuracy in multi-step chains but struggle with precise intermediate links. Error analysis reveals false positives related to naming assumptions and architectural patterns. Task-framing strategies are crucial for performance. The study suggests LLMs are valuable for trace discovery but may require human-in-the-loop tool design to address limitations and specific error patterns for further research. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new potential for automating documentation-to-code traceability, yet their capabilities remain underexplored. We present a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, and o3-mini) in establishing trace links between various software documentation (including API references and user guides) and source code. We create two novel datasets from two open-source projects (Unity Catalog and Crawl4AI). Through systematic experiments, we assess three key capabilities: (1) trace link identification accuracy, (2) relationship explanation quality, and (3) multi-step chain reconstruction. Results show that the best-performing LLM achieves F1-scores of 79.4% and 80.4% across the two datasets, substantially outperforming our baselines (TF-IDF, BM25, and CodeBERT). While fully correct relationship explanations range from 42.9% to 71.1%, partial accuracy exceeds 97%, indicating that fundamental connections are rarely missed. For multi-step chains, LLMs maintain high endpoint accuracy but vary in capturing precise intermediate links. Error analysis reveals that many false positives stem from naming-based assumptions, phantom links, or overgeneralization of architectural patterns. We demonstrate that task-framing, such as a one-to-many matching strategy, is critical for performance. These findings position LLMs as powerful assistants for trace discovery, but their limitations could necessitate human-in-the-loop tool design and highlight specific error patterns for future research.

<div> Keywords: Software libraries, Large Language Models, Python, Usability, Dependencies

Summary:
Software libraries play a crucial role in modern code development, influencing functionality and maintainability. Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to recommend libraries for programming tasks. An empirical study examined six state-of-the-art LLMs to solve real-world Python problems from Stack Overflow. Results showed that LLMs prefer third-party libraries over standard ones, often recommending mature, popular, and permissively licensed dependencies. However, there were usability gaps identified: a percentage of libraries could not be resolved automatically due to structural mismatches, and only two models provided installation guidance. The generated code was technically valid, but lacked contextual support, leaving users to manually resolve dependencies. The findings provide insights for developers and researchers, highlighting the need to enhance the reliability and usability of LLM-generated code, particularly in the context of software dependencies.

Abstract: Software libraries are central to the functionality, security, and maintainability of modern code. As developers increasingly turn to Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist with programming tasks, understanding how these models recommend libraries is essential. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study of six state-of-the-art LLMs, both proprietary and open-source, by prompting them to solve real-world Python problems sourced from Stack Overflow. We analyze the types of libraries they import, the characteristics of those libraries, and the extent to which the recommendations are usable out of the box. Our results show that LLMs predominantly favour third-party libraries over standard ones, and often recommend mature, popular, and permissively licensed dependencies. However, we also identify gaps in usability: 4.6% of the libraries could not be resolved automatically due to structural mismatches between import names and installable packages, and only two models (out of six) provided installation guidance. While the generated code is technically valid, the lack of contextual support places the burden of manually resolving dependencies on the user. Our findings offer actionable insights for both developers and researchers, and highlight opportunities to improve the reliability and usability of LLM-generated code in the context of software dependencies.

Summary: 
This article introduces a reinforcement learning framework for efficiently synthesizing quantum circuits that produce target quantum states from an initial state. The framework utilizes tabular Q-learning in a discretized quantum state space to manage dimensionality effectively. A hybrid reward mechanism guides the agent towards the target state while avoiding inefficient circuit structures. Through sparse matrix representations and state-space discretization, the method allows scalable navigation in high-dimensional environments with minimal computational overhead. Benchmarking on graph-state preparation tasks shows that the algorithm consistently discovers minimal-depth circuits with optimized gate counts. Even when extended to a universal gate set for arbitrary quantum states, it still produces minimal-depth circuits, demonstrating its robustness and adaptability. Overall, this RL-driven approach efficiently explores the quantum state space and synthesizes near-optimal quantum circuits, providing a foundation for resource-efficient quantum circuit optimization.

Abstract: A reinforcement learning (RL) framework is introduced for the efficient synthesis of quantum circuits that generate specified target quantum states from a fixed initial state, addressing a central challenge in both the NISQ era and future fault-tolerant quantum computing. The approach utilizes tabular Q-learning, based on action sequences, within a discretized quantum state space, to effectively manage the exponential growth of the space dimension. The framework introduces a hybrid reward mechanism, combining a static, domain-informed reward that guides the agent toward the target state with customizable dynamic penalties that discourage inefficient circuit structures such as gate congestion and redundant state revisits. By leveraging sparse matrix representations and state-space discretization, the method enables scalable navigation of high-dimensional environments while minimizing computational overhead. Benchmarking on graph-state preparation tasks for up to seven qubits, we demonstrate that the algorithm consistently discovers minimal-depth circuits with optimized gate counts. Moreover, extending the framework to a universal gate set for arbitrary quantum states, it still produces minimal depth circuits, highlighting the algorithm's robustness and adaptability. The results confirm that this RL-driven approach efficiently explores the complex quantum state space and synthesizes near-optimal quantum circuits, providing a resource-efficient foundation for quantum circuit optimization.

Summary: Our study of AI-powered search systems shows that users prefer concise, source-attributed responses over verbose explanations. Current AI trends towards artificial sophistication lead to reduced user trust and increased cognitive load. Optimal AI communication should mirror effective human discourse by being direct, properly sourced, and transparent about limitations. The prevailing assumption that complex AI responses indicate better performance is challenged, with human-like brevity and transparency being key to user engagement and system reliability. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) in search applications increasingly prioritize verbose, lexically complex responses that paradoxically reduce user satisfaction and engagement. Through a comprehensive study of 10.000 (est.) participants comparing responses from five major AI-powered search systems, we demonstrate that users overwhelmingly prefer concise, source-attributed responses over elaborate explanations. Our analysis reveals that current AI development trends toward "artificial sophistication" create an uncanny valley effect where systems sound knowledgeable but lack genuine critical thinking, leading to reduced trust and increased cognitive load. We present evidence that optimal AI communication mirrors effective human discourse: direct, properly sourced, and honest about limitations. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption that more complex AI responses indicate better performance, instead suggesting that human-like brevity and transparency are key to user engagement and system reliability.

Abstract: We introduce a low-latency telecom AI voice agent pipeline for real-time, interactive telecommunications use, enabling advanced voice AI for call center automation, intelligent IVR (Interactive Voice Response), and AI-driven customer support. The solution is built for telecom, combining four specialized models by NetoAI: TSLAM, a 4-bit quantized Telecom-Specific Large Language Model (LLM); T-VEC, a Telecom-Specific Embedding Model; TTE, a Telecom-Specific Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model; and T-Synth, a Telecom-Specific Text-to-Speech (TTS) model. These models enable highly responsive, domain-adapted voice AI agents supporting knowledge-grounded spoken interactions with low latency. The pipeline integrates streaming ASR (TTE), conversational intelligence (TSLAM), retrieval augmented generation (RAG) over telecom documents, and real-time TTS (T-Synth), setting a new benchmark for telecom voice assistants. To evaluate the system, we built a dataset of 500 human-recorded telecom questions from RFCs, simulating real telecom agent queries. This framework allows analysis of latency, domain relevance, and real-time performance across the stack. Results show that TSLAM, TTE, and T-Synth deliver real-time factors (RTF) below 1.0, supporting enterprise, low-latency telecom deployments. These AI agents -- powered by TSLAM, TTE, and T-Synth -- provide a foundation for next-generation telecom AI, enabling automated customer support, diagnostics, and more.

Abstract: Emotions critically influence mental health, driving interest in music-based affective computing via neurophysiological signals with Brain-computer Interface techniques. While prior studies leverage music's accessibility for emotion induction, three key limitations persist: \textbf{(1) Stimulus Constraints}: Music stimuli are confined to small corpora due to copyright and curation costs, with selection biases from heuristic emotion-music mappings that ignore individual affective profiles. \textbf{(2) Modality Specificity}: Overreliance on unimodal neural data (e.g., EEG) ignores complementary insights from cross-modal signal fusion.\textbf{ (3) Portability Limitation}: Cumbersome setups (e.g., 64+ channel gel-based EEG caps) hinder real-world applicability due to procedural complexity and portability barriers. To address these limitations, we propose MEEtBrain, a portable and multimodal framework for emotion analysis (valence/arousal), integrating AI-generated music stimuli with synchronized EEG-fNIRS acquisition via a wireless headband. By MEEtBrain, the music stimuli can be automatically generated by AI on a large scale, eliminating subjective selection biases while ensuring music diversity. We use our developed portable device that is designed in a lightweight headband-style and uses dry electrodes, to simultaneously collect EEG and fNIRS recordings. A 14-hour dataset from 20 participants was collected in the first recruitment to validate the framework's efficacy, with AI-generated music eliciting target emotions (valence/arousal). We are actively expanding our multimodal dataset (44 participants in the latest dataset) and make it publicly available to promote further research and practical applications. \textbf{The dataset is available at https://zju-bmi-lab.github.io/ZBra.

Abstract: Augmentation technologies are undergoing a process of enculturation due to many factors, one being the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), or what the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) terms the AI wave or AI boom. Chapter 3 focuses critical attention on the hyped assumption that sophisticated, emergent, and embodied augmentation technologies will improve lives, literacy, cultures, arts, economies, and social contexts. The chapter begins by discussing the problem of ambiguity with AI terminology, which it aids with a description of the WIPO Categorization of AI Technologies Scheme. It then draws on media and communication studies to explore concepts such as agents, agency, power, and agentive relationships between humans and robots. The chapter focuses on the development of non-human agents in industry as a critical factor in the rise of augmentation technologies. It looks at how marketing communication enculturates future users to adopt and adapt to the technology. Scholars are charting the significant ways that people are drawn further into commercial digital landscapes, such as the Metaverse concept, in post-internet society. It concludes by examining recent claims concerning the Metaverse and augmented reality.

<br />Summary: 
This study explores the use of a multi-level Vector-Quantized Generative Adversarial Network (VQGAN) to generate virtual H&amp;E stains from multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) images. The virtual stains provide important morphological context to the molecular data, bridging the gap between molecular and morphological analysis. Comparing the VQGAN with a standard conditional GAN (cGAN) on colorectal cancer datasets, it is found that the VQGAN produces higher-fidelity virtual stains that are more useful for computer-aided diagnosis. The VQGAN-generated stains exhibit superior performance in downstream tasks such as nuclei segmentation and tissue classification, showing better agreement with ground-truth analysis. This research establishes the VQGAN as a robust and effective architecture for generating scientifically valuable virtual stains, enabling the integration of rich molecular data from mIF into established H&amp;E-based analytical workflows. <div>

Abstract: While multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) imaging provides deep, spatially-resolved molecular data, integrating this information with the morphological standard of Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&amp;E) can be very important for obtaining complementary information about the underlying tissue. Generating a virtual H&amp;E stain from mIF data offers a powerful solution, providing immediate morphological context. Crucially, this approach enables the application of the vast ecosystem of H&amp;E-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools to analyze rich molecular data, bridging the gap between molecular and morphological analysis. In this work, we investigate the use of a multi-level Vector-Quantized Generative Adversarial Network (VQGAN) to create high-fidelity virtual H&amp;E stains from mIF images. We rigorously evaluated our VQGAN against a standard conditional GAN (cGAN) baseline on two publicly available colorectal cancer datasets, assessing performance on both image similarity and functional utility for downstream analysis. Our results show that while both architectures produce visually plausible images, the virtual stains generated by our VQGAN provide a more effective substrate for computer-aided diagnosis. Specifically, downstream nuclei segmentation and semantic preservation in tissue classification tasks performed on VQGAN-generated images demonstrate superior performance and agreement with ground-truth analysis compared to those from the cGAN. This work establishes that a multi-level VQGAN is a robust and superior architecture for generating scientifically useful virtual stains, offering a viable pathway to integrate the rich molecular data of mIF into established and powerful H&amp;E-based analytical workflows.

<div> Keywords: Retinal detachment, Macula-intact, Macula-detached, Point-of-care ultrasound, Deep learning

Summary:
The article discusses the importance of timely intervention in cases of retinal detachment (RD) which can lead to vision loss. Macular involvement, whether intact or detached, greatly impacts visual outcomes. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is a valuable tool for detecting RD but limited by the expertise required for image interpretation. The lack of machine learning algorithms for RD diagnosis, especially in detecting macular status, is an area of concern. The introduction of the ERDES dataset, the first open-access dataset of ocular ultrasound clips labeled for RD presence and macular status, aims to address this gap and facilitate the development of ML models for RD detection. Baseline benchmarks using CNN architectures are provided, and all data and code are openly available for research purposes. This dataset and the potential for deep learning in ultrasound image analysis have the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosing RD. 

<br /><br />Summary: 
1. Timely intervention is crucial for preserving vision in cases of retinal detachment (RD).
2. Macular involvement determines visual outcomes, emphasizing the importance of accurate diagnosis.
3. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is a valuable tool for detecting RD but requires expertise for interpretation.
4. Machine learning algorithms for RD diagnosis, particularly in macular status assessment, are lacking.
5. The ERDES dataset, open-access and labeled for RD presence and macula status, aims to address this gap.
6. Baseline benchmarks using CNN architectures are provided for research and development purposes.
7. Deep learning in ultrasound image analysis shows promise for improving RD diagnosis accuracy and efficiency. <div>

Abstract: Retinal detachment (RD) is a vision-threatening condition that requires timely intervention to preserve vision. Macular involvement -- whether the macula is still intact (macula-intact) or detached (macula-detached) -- is the key determinant of visual outcomes and treatment urgency. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) offers a fast, non-invasive, cost-effective, and accessible imaging modality widely used in diverse clinical settings to detect RD. However, ultrasound image interpretation is limited by a lack of expertise among healthcare providers, especially in resource-limited settings. Deep learning offers the potential to automate ultrasound-based assessment of RD. However, there are no ML ultrasound algorithms currently available for clinical use to detect RD and no prior research has been done on assessing macular status using ultrasound in RD cases -- an essential distinction for surgical prioritization. Moreover, no public dataset currently supports macular-based RD classification using ultrasound video clips. We introduce Eye Retinal DEtachment ultraSound, ERDES, the first open-access dataset of ocular ultrasound clips labeled for (i) presence of retinal detachment and (ii) macula-intact versus macula-detached status. The dataset is intended to facilitate the development and evaluation of machine learning models for detecting retinal detachment. We also provide baseline benchmarks using multiple spatiotemporal convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. All clips, labels, and training code are publicly available at https://osupcvlab.github.io/ERDES/.

<div> prediction, repair duration, equity, power restoration, reinforcement learning<br />
Summary:<br />
The article addresses the need for an equitable and efficient power system restoration strategy in the face of extreme weather events. It highlights the disparity in power restoration request submissions from disadvantaged communities, leading to vulnerability and extended outages. The proposed solution, EPOPR, incorporates Equity-Conformalized Quantile Regression for uncertainty-aware repair duration prediction and Spatial-Temporal Attentional RL for equitable decision-making. By balancing restoration efficiency and equity, EPOPR reduces average outage duration by 3.60% and decreases inequity between communities by 14.19% compared to existing methods. Its innovative approach overcomes challenges in repair duration prediction under heteroscedasticity and addresses the tendency of reinforcement learning agents to favor low-uncertainty actions that may undermine equity. EPOPR's data-driven analysis and novel framework offer a promising solution for more equitable and efficient power system restoration in the face of increasing extreme weather events. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.04780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing frequency of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, highlights the urgent need for efficient and equitable power system restoration. Many electricity providers make restoration decisions primarily based on the volume of power restoration requests from each region. However, our data-driven analysis reveals significant disparities in request submission volume, as disadvantaged communities tend to submit fewer restoration requests. This disparity makes the current restoration solution inequitable, leaving these communities vulnerable to extended power outages. To address this, we aim to propose an equity-aware power restoration strategy that balances both restoration efficiency and equity across communities. However, achieving this goal is challenging for two reasons: the difficulty of predicting repair durations under dataset heteroscedasticity, and the tendency of reinforcement learning agents to favor low-uncertainty actions, which potentially undermine equity. To overcome these challenges, we design a predict-then-optimize framework called EPOPR with two key components: (1) Equity-Conformalized Quantile Regression for uncertainty-aware repair duration prediction, and (2) Spatial-Temporal Attentional RL that adapts to varying uncertainty levels across regions for equitable decision-making. Experimental results show that our EPOPR effectively reduces the average power outage duration by 3.60% and decreases inequity between different communities by 14.19% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

In this study, the researchers propose a post-processing step in dialogue transcription pipelines that enriches transcribed dialogues by adding metadata tags for speaker characteristics such as age, gender, and emotion. They utilize frozen audio foundation models and a frozen LLAMA language model to infer these speaker attributes without the need for task-specific fine-tuning. By employing lightweight connectors to bridge audio and language representations, they achieve competitive performance on speaker profiling tasks while maintaining modularity and speed. Furthermore, they demonstrate that a frozen LLAMA model can compare x-vectors directly, showing promising results with an Equal Error Rate of 8.8% in certain scenarios. This approach could enhance the quality and depth of information available in transcribed dialogues, offering potential benefits for various applications in speech processing and analysis. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In dialogue transcription pipelines, Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently employed in post-processing to improve grammar, punctuation, and readability. We explore a complementary post-processing step: enriching transcribed dialogues by adding metadata tags for speaker characteristics such as age, gender, and emotion. Some of the tags are global to the entire dialogue, while some are time-variant. Our approach couples frozen audio foundation models, such as Whisper or WavLM, with a frozen LLAMA language model to infer these speaker attributes, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning of either model. Using lightweight, efficient connectors to bridge audio and language representations, we achieve competitive performance on speaker profiling tasks while preserving modularity and speed. Additionally, we demonstrate that a frozen LLAMA model can compare x-vectors directly, achieving an Equal Error Rate of 8.8% in some scenarios.

<div> frequency-based objectives, tokenization, NLP pipelines, Parity-aware Byte Pair Encoding, lower-resource languages
Summary:<br /><br />Tokenization is a crucial step in natural language processing pipelines, but standard algorithms based on frequency objectives often disadvantage lower-resource languages with inefficient tokenizations. To address this issue, Parity-aware Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) is introduced, which focuses on maximizing compression gain for languages with the worst compression at each merge step. This approach aims to achieve cross-lingual parity in token counts while maintaining global compression rates and language-model performance in downstream tasks. Empirical results show that Parity-aware BPE leads to more equitable token counts across languages without significantly impacting overall compression rates or language-model performance. Overall, this approach aims to reduce the computational and financial inequalities between users from different language backgrounds in NLP applications.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Tokenization is the first -- and often least scrutinized -- step of most NLP pipelines. Standard algorithms for learning tokenizers rely on frequency-based objectives, which favor languages dominant in the training data and consequently leave lower-resource languages with tokenizations that are disproportionately longer, morphologically implausible, or even riddled with  placeholders. This phenomenon ultimately amplifies computational and financial inequalities between users from different language backgrounds. To remedy this, we introduce Parity-aware Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a variant of the widely-used BPE algorithm. At every merge step, Parity-aware BPE maximizes the compression gain of the currently worst-compressed language, trading a small amount of global compression for cross-lingual parity. We find empirically that Parity-aware BPE leads to more equitable token counts across languages, with negligible impact on global compression rate and no substantial effect on language-model performance in downstream tasks.

Summary: 
This article presents a framework for integrating data-driven algorithms with classical process models in process control. The framework focuses on representing interconnections among process network units, deriving a system's objective function based on non-equilibrium entropy production, and implementing distributed control and optimization in process network structures. The approach relies on the use of conic sector conditions for flow expressions and enables the integration of conservation properties from topology with dynamic relations learned from data through neural networks. A practical example of integrating process topology with a neural network ordinary differential equation model is demonstrated, where the neural network learns constitutive equations using synthetic time-series data. The resulting neural network can be used as a state space model for applications such as model predictive control algorithms. <div>

Abstract: Most recent advances in machine learning and analytics for process control pose the question of how to naturally integrate new data-driven methods with classical process models and control. We propose a process modeling framework enabling integration of data-driven algorithms through consistent topological properties and conservation of extensive quantities. Interconnections among process network units are represented through connectivity matrices and network graphs. We derive the system's natural objective function equivalent to the non-equilibrium entropy production in a steady state system as a driving force for the process dynamics. We illustrate how distributed control and optimization can be implemented into process network structures and how control laws and algorithms alter the system's natural equilibrium towards engineered objectives. The basic requirement is that the flow conditions can be expressed in terms of conic sector (passivity) conditions. Our formalism allows integration of fundamental conservation properties from topology with learned dynamic relations from data through sparse deep neural networks.
  We demonstrate in a practical example of a simple inventory control system how to integrate the basic topology of a process with a neural network ordinary differential equation model. The system specific constitutive equations are left undescribed and learned by the neural ordinary differential equation algorithm using the adjoint method in combination with an adaptive ODE solver from synthetic time-series data. The resulting neural network forms a state space model for use in e.g. a model predictive control algorithm.

Summary: <br />
A new framework called Consensus-oriented Masked Distillation (CoMAD) is introduced to unify knowledge from multiple self-supervised Vision Transformers. The framework distills insights from three pretrained teachers into a compact student network using asymmetric masking and consensus gating. The student is trained with dual-level KL divergence on visible tokens and reconstructed feature maps. CoMAD's ViT-Tiny achieves a state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet-1K with 75.4 percent Top-1 accuracy. In dense-prediction tasks, it achieves 47.3 percent mIoU on ADE20K and sets new records in box average precision and mask average precision on MS-COCO. The proposed framework addresses the challenges of large model sizes and isolated pretraining methods in self-supervised learning, providing a lightweight and effective solution for distillation. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Numerous self-supervised learning paradigms, such as contrastive learning and masked image modeling, learn powerful representations from unlabeled data but are typically pretrained in isolation, overlooking complementary insights and yielding large models that are impractical for resource-constrained deployment. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Consensus-oriented Masked Distillation (CoMAD), a lightweight, parameter-free framework that unifies knowledge from multiple current state-of-the-art self-supervised Vision Transformers into a compact student network. CoMAD distills from three pretrained ViT-Base teachers, MAE, MoCo v3, and iBOT, each offering distinct semantic and contextual priors. Rather than naively averaging teacher outputs, we apply asymmetric masking: the student sees only 25 percent of patches while each teacher receives a progressively lighter, unique mask, forcing the student to interpolate missing features under richer contexts. Teacher embeddings are aligned to the student's space via a linear adapter and layer normalization, then fused through our joint consensus gating, which weights each token by combining cosine affinity with inter-teacher agreement. The student is trained with dual-level KL divergence on visible tokens and reconstructed feature maps, capturing both local and global structure. On ImageNet-1K, CoMAD's ViT-Tiny achieves 75.4 percent Top-1, an increment of 0.4 percent over the previous state-of-the-art. In dense-prediction transfers, it attains 47.3 percent mIoU on ADE20K, and 44.5 percent box average precision and 40.5 percent mask average precision on MS-COCO, establishing a new state-of-the-art in compact SSL distillation.

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) are being explored for generating log statements in software development, particularly in machine learning (ML) projects. A study evaluated GPT-4o mini's ability to generate log statements at the file level in ML repositories. The LLM placed logs in a similar position as humans in around 64% of cases but had a high overlogging rate of 82.66%. Challenges identified included overlogging at the beginning or end of functions, difficulty logging within large code blocks, and misalignment with project-specific logging conventions. While the LLM shows potential for generating logs for complete files, addressing these limitations is necessary for practical implementation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Logging is essential in software development, helping developers monitor system behavior and aiding in debugging applications. Given the ability of large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language and code, researchers are exploring their potential to generate log statements. However, prior work focuses on evaluating logs introduced in code functions, leaving file-level log generation underexplored -- especially in machine learning (ML) applications, where comprehensive logging can enhance reliability. In this study, we evaluate the capacity of GPT-4o mini as a case study to generate log statements for ML projects at file level. We gathered a set of 171 ML repositories containing 4,073 Python files with at least one log statement. We identified and removed the original logs from the files, prompted the LLM to generate logs for them, and evaluated both the position of the logs and log level, variables, and text quality of the generated logs compared to human-written logs. In addition, we manually analyzed a representative sample of generated logs to identify common patterns and challenges. We find that the LLM introduces logs in the same place as humans in 63.91% of cases, but at the cost of a high overlogging rate of 82.66%. Furthermore, our manual analysis reveals challenges for file-level logging, which shows overlogging at the beginning or end of a function, difficulty logging within large code blocks, and misalignment with project-specific logging conventions. While the LLM shows promise for generating logs for complete files, these limitations remain to be addressed for practical implementation.

Abstract: Virtual try-on aims to synthesize a realistic image of a person wearing a target garment, but accurately modeling garment-body correspondence remains a persistent challenge, especially under pose and appearance variation. In this paper, we propose Voost - a unified and scalable framework that jointly learns virtual try-on and try-off with a single diffusion transformer. By modeling both tasks jointly, Voost enables each garment-person pair to supervise both directions and supports flexible conditioning over generation direction and garment category, enhancing garment-body relational reasoning without task-specific networks, auxiliary losses, or additional labels. In addition, we introduce two inference-time techniques: attention temperature scaling for robustness to resolution or mask variation, and self-corrective sampling that leverages bidirectional consistency between tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Voost achieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and try-off benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong baselines in alignment accuracy, visual fidelity, and generalization.

Abstract: Large language models require consistent behavioral patterns for safe deployment, yet their personality-like traits remain poorly understood. We present PERSIST (PERsonality Stability in Synthetic Text), a comprehensive evaluation framework testing 25+ open-source models (1B-671B parameters) across 500,000+ responses. Using traditional (BFI-44, SD3) and novel LLM-adapted personality instruments, we systematically vary question order, paraphrasing, personas, and reasoning modes. Our findings challenge fundamental deployment assumptions: (1) Even 400B+ models exhibit substantial response variability (SD > 0.4); (2) Minor prompt reordering alone shifts personality measurements by up to 20%; (3) Interventions expected to stabilize behavior, such as chain-of-thought reasoning, detailed personas instruction, inclusion of conversation history, can paradoxically increase variability; (4) LLM-adapted instruments show equal instability to human-centric versions, confirming architectural rather than translational limitations. This persistent instability across scales and mitigation strategies suggests current LLMs lack the foundations for genuine behavioral consistency. For safety-critical applications requiring predictable behavior, these findings indicate that personality-based alignment strategies may be fundamentally inadequate.

Abstract: The Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol is a standard for in-vehicle communication but remains susceptible to cyber-attacks due to its lack of built-in security. This paper presents a multi-stage intrusion detection framework leveraging unsupervised anomaly detection and supervised graph learning tailored for automotive CAN traffic. Our architecture combines a Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE) for structural anomaly detection with a Knowledge-Distilled Graph Attention Network (KD-GAT) for robust attack classification. CAN bus activity is encoded as graph sequences to model temporal and relational dependencies. The pipeline applies VGAE-based selective undersampling to address class imbalance, followed by GAT classification with optional score-level fusion. The compact student GAT achieves 96% parameter reduction compared to the teacher model while maintaining strong predictive performance. Experiments on six public CAN intrusion datasets--Car-Hacking, Car-Survival, and can-train-and-test--demonstrate competitive accuracy and efficiency, with average improvements of 16.2% in F1-score over existing methods, particularly excelling on highly imbalanced datasets with up to 55% F1-score improvements.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has become a crucial tool for reducing the memory and compute costs of modern deep neural networks, including large language models (LLMs). Among PTQ algorithms, the OPTQ framework-also known as GPTQ-has emerged as a leading method due to its computational efficiency and strong empirical performance. Despite its widespread adoption, however, OPTQ lacks rigorous quantitative theoretical guarantees. This paper presents the first quantitative error bounds for both deterministic and stochastic variants of OPTQ, as well as for Qronos, a recent related state-of-the-art PTQ algorithm. We analyze how OPTQ's iterative procedure induces quantization error and derive non-asymptotic 2-norm error bounds that depend explicitly on the calibration data and a regularization parameter that OPTQ uses. Our analysis provides theoretical justification for several practical design choices, including the widely used heuristic of ordering features by decreasing norm, as well as guidance for selecting the regularization parameter. For the stochastic variant, we establish stronger infinity-norm error bounds, which enable control over the required quantization alphabet and are particularly useful for downstream layers and nonlinearities. Finally, we extend our analysis to Qronos, providing new theoretical bounds, for both its deterministic and stochastic variants, that help explain its empirical advantages.

Abstract: As hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) gain traction in heavy-duty trucks, adaptive and efficient energy management is critical for reducing fuel consumption while maintaining battery charge for long operation times. We present a new reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm to optimize engine control in series HEVs. We reformulate the control task as a sequential decision-making problem and enhance SAC by incorporating Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) and Decision Transformers (DTs) into both actor and critic networks to capture temporal dependencies and improve planning over time. To evaluate robustness and generalization, we train the models under diverse initial battery states, drive cycle durations, power demands, and input sequence lengths. Experiments show that the SAC agent with a DT-based actor and GRU-based critic was within 1.8% of Dynamic Programming (DP) in fuel savings on the Highway Fuel Economy Test (HFET) cycle, while the SAC agent with GRUs in both actor and critic networks, and FFN actor-critic agent were within 3.16% and 3.43%, respectively. On unseen drive cycles (US06 and Heavy Heavy-Duty Diesel Truck (HHDDT) cruise segment), generalized sequence-aware agents consistently outperformed feedforward network (FFN)-based agents, highlighting their adaptability and robustness in real-world settings.

Abstract: Air pollution is a global hazard, and as of 2023, 94\% of the world's population is exposed to unsafe pollution levels. Surface Ozone (O3), an important pollutant, and the drivers of its trends are difficult to model, and traditional physics-based models fall short in their practical use for scales relevant to human-health impacts. Deep Learning-based emulators have shown promise in capturing complex climate patterns, but overall lack the interpretability necessary to support critical decision making for policy changes and public health measures. We implement an uncertainty-aware U-Net architecture to predict the Multi-mOdel Multi-cOnstituent Chemical data assimilation (MOMO-Chem) model's surface ozone residuals (bias) using Bayesian and quantile regression methods. We demonstrate the capability of our techniques in regional estimation of bias in North America and Europe for June 2019. We highlight the uncertainty quantification (UQ) scores between our two UQ methodologies and discern which ground stations are optimal and sub-optimal candidates for MOMO-Chem bias correction, and evaluate the impact of land-use information in surface ozone residual modeling.

Abstract: Air pollution is the world's largest environmental risk factor for human disease and premature death, resulting in more than 6 million permature deaths in 2019. Currently, there is still a challenge to model one of the most important air pollutants, surface ozone, particularly at scales relevant for human health impacts, with the drivers of global ozone trends at these scales largely unknown, limiting the practical use of physics-based models. We employ a 2D Convolutional Neural Network based architecture that estimate surface ozone MOMO-Chem model residuals, referred to as model bias. We demonstrate the potential of this technique in North America and Europe, highlighting its ability better to capture physical model residuals compared to a traditional machine learning method. We assess the impact of incorporating land use information from high-resolution satellite imagery to improve model estimates. Importantly, we discuss how our results can improve our scientific understanding of the factors impacting ozone bias at urban scales that can be used to improve environmental policy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated with graph-structured data for tasks like node classification, a domain traditionally dominated by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). While this integration leverages rich relational information to improve task performance, their robustness against adversarial attacks remains unexplored. We take the first step to explore the vulnerabilities of graph-aware LLMs by leveraging existing adversarial attack methods tailored for graph-based models, including those for poisoning (training-time attacks) and evasion (test-time attacks), on two representative models, LLAGA (Chen et al. 2024) and GRAPHPROMPTER (Liu et al. 2024). Additionally, we discover a new attack surface for LLAGA where an attacker can inject malicious nodes as placeholders into the node sequence template to severely degrade its performance. Our systematic analysis reveals that certain design choices in graph encoding can enhance attack success, with specific findings that: (1) the node sequence template in LLAGA increases its vulnerability; (2) the GNN encoder used in GRAPHPROMPTER demonstrates greater robustness; and (3) both approaches remain susceptible to imperceptible feature perturbation attacks. Finally, we propose an end-to-end defense framework GALGUARD, that combines an LLM-based feature correction module to mitigate feature-level perturbations and adapted GNN defenses to protect against structural attacks.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online multimedia content has intensified the spread of hate speech, presenting critical societal and regulatory challenges. While recent work has advanced multimodal hateful video detection, most approaches rely on coarse, video-level annotations that overlook the temporal granularity of hateful content. This introduces substantial label noise, as videos annotated as hateful often contain long non-hateful segments. In this paper, we investigate the impact of such label ambiguity through a fine-grained approach. Specifically, we trim hateful videos from the HateMM and MultiHateClip English datasets using annotated timestamps to isolate explicitly hateful segments. We then conduct an exploratory analysis of these trimmed segments to examine the distribution and characteristics of both hateful and non-hateful content. This analysis highlights the degree of semantic overlap and the confusion introduced by coarse, video-level annotations. Finally, controlled experiments demonstrated that time-stamp noise fundamentally alters model decision boundaries and weakens classification confidence, highlighting the inherent context dependency and temporal continuity of hate speech expression. Our findings provide new insights into the temporal dynamics of multimodal hateful videos and highlight the need for temporally aware models and benchmarks for improved robustness and interpretability.

Abstract: Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems have shown strong potential in complex reasoning and collaborative decision-making tasks. However, most existing coordination schemes rely on static or full-context routing strategies, which lead to excessive token consumption, redundant memory exposure, and limited adaptability across interaction rounds. We introduce RCR-Router, a modular and role-aware context routing framework designed to enable efficient, adaptive collaboration in multi-agent LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first routing approach that dynamically selects semantically relevant memory subsets for each agent based on its role and task stage, while adhering to a strict token budget. A lightweight scoring policy guides memory selection, and agent outputs are iteratively integrated into a shared memory store to facilitate progressive context refinement. To better evaluate model behavior, we further propose an Answer Quality Score metric that captures LLM-generated explanations beyond standard QA accuracy. Experiments on three multi-hop QA benchmarks -- HotPotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultihop -- demonstrate that RCR-Router reduces token usage (up to 30%) while improving or maintaining answer quality. These results highlight the importance of structured memory routing and output-aware evaluation in advancing scalable multi-agent LLM systems.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms are at the core of modern neural architectures, powering systems ranging from ChatGPT to autonomous vehicles and driving a major economic impact. However, high-profile failures, such as ChatGPT's nonsensical outputs or Google's suspension of Gemini's image generation due to attention weight errors, highlight a critical gap: existing deep learning fault taxonomies might not adequately capture the unique failures introduced by attention mechanisms. This gap leaves practitioners without actionable diagnostic guidance. To address this gap, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of faults in attention-based neural networks (ABNNs). Our work is based on a systematic analysis of 555 real-world faults collected from 96 projects across ten frameworks, including GitHub, Hugging Face, and Stack Overflow. Through our analysis, we develop a novel taxonomy comprising seven attention-specific fault categories, not captured by existing work. Our results show that over half of the ABNN faults arise from mechanisms unique to attention architectures. We further analyze the root causes and manifestations of these faults through various symptoms. Finally, by analyzing symptom-root cause associations, we identify four evidence-based diagnostic heuristics that explain 33.0% of attention-specific faults, offering the first systematic diagnostic guidance for attention-based models.

<title>Extending Foundational Monocular Depth Estimators to Fisheye Cameras with Calibration Tokens</title>

Abstract: We propose a method to extend foundational monocular depth estimators (FMDEs), trained on perspective images, to fisheye images. Despite being trained on tens of millions of images, FMDEs are susceptible to the covariate shift introduced by changes in camera calibration (intrinsic, distortion) parameters, leading to erroneous depth estimates. Our method aligns the distribution of latent embeddings encoding fisheye images to those of perspective images, enabling the reuse of FMDEs for fisheye cameras without retraining or finetuning. To this end, we introduce a set of Calibration Tokens as a light-weight adaptation mechanism that modulates the latent embeddings for alignment. By exploiting the already expressive latent space of FMDEs, we posit that modulating their embeddings avoids the negative impact of artifacts and loss introduced in conventional recalibration or map projection to a canonical reference frame in the image space. Our method is self-supervised and does not require fisheye images but leverages publicly available large-scale perspective image datasets. This is done by recalibrating perspective images to fisheye images, and enforcing consistency between their estimates during training. We evaluate our approach with several FMDEs, on both indoors and outdoors, where we consistently improve over state-of-the-art methods using a single set of tokens for both.

Abstract: Traditional control and planning for robotic manipulation heavily rely on precise physical models and predefined action sequences. While effective in structured environments, such approaches often fail in real-world scenarios due to modeling inaccuracies and struggle to generalize to novel tasks. In contrast, humans intuitively interact with their surroundings, demonstrating remarkable adaptability, making efficient decisions through implicit physical understanding. In this work, we propose INTENTION, a novel framework enabling robots with learned interactive intuition and autonomous manipulation in diverse scenarios, by integrating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) based scene reasoning with interaction-driven memory. We introduce Memory Graph to record scenes from previous task interactions which embodies human-like understanding and decision-making about different tasks in real world. Meanwhile, we design an Intuitive Perceptor that extracts physical relations and affordances from visual scenes. Together, these components empower robots to infer appropriate interaction behaviors in new scenes without relying on repetitive instructions. Videos: https://robo-intention.github.io

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) aims to create a scene graph for each video frame by detecting objects and predicting their relationships. Weakly Supervised DSGG (WS-DSGG) reduces annotation workload by using an unlocalized scene graph from a single frame per video for training. Existing WS-DSGG methods depend on an off-the-shelf external object detector to generate pseudo labels for subsequent DSGG training. However, detectors trained on static, object-centric images struggle in dynamic, relation-aware scenarios required for DSGG, leading to inaccurate localization and low-confidence proposals. To address the challenges posed by external object detectors in WS-DSGG, we propose a Temporal-enhanced Relation-aware Knowledge Transferring (TRKT) method, which leverages knowledge to enhance detection in relation-aware dynamic scenarios. TRKT is built on two key components:(1)Relation-aware knowledge mining: we first employ object and relation class decoders that generate category-specific attention maps to highlight both object regions and interactive areas. Then we propose an Inter-frame Attention Augmentation strategy that exploits optical flow for neighboring frames to enhance the attention maps, making them motion-aware and robust to motion blur. This step yields relation- and motion-aware knowledge mining for WS-DSGG. (2) we introduce a Dual-stream Fusion Module that integrates category-specific attention maps into external detections to refine object localization and boost confidence scores for object proposals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TRKT achieves state-of-the-art performance on Action Genome dataset. Our code is avaliable at https://github.com/XZPKU/TRKT.git.

<title>Towards Robust Evaluation of Visual Activity Recognition: Resolving Verb Ambiguity with Sense Clustering</title>

Abstract: Evaluating visual activity recognition systems is challenging due to inherent ambiguities in verb semantics and image interpretation. When describing actions in images, synonymous verbs can refer to the same event (e.g., brushing vs. grooming), while different perspectives can lead to equally valid but distinct verb choices (e.g., piloting vs. operating). Standard exact-match evaluation, which relies on a single gold answer, fails to capture these ambiguities, resulting in an incomplete assessment of model performance. To address this, we propose a vision-language clustering framework that constructs verb sense clusters, providing a more robust evaluation. Our analysis of the imSitu dataset shows that each image maps to an average of 2.8 sense clusters, with each cluster representing a distinct perspective of the image. We evaluate multiple activity recognition models and compare our cluster-based evaluation with standard evaluation methods. Additionally, our human alignment analysis suggests that the cluster-based evaluation better aligns with human judgements, offering a more nuanced assessment of model performance.

Abstract: Training deep learning (DL) models has become a dominant workload in data-centers and improving resource utilization is a key goal of DL cluster schedulers. In order to do this, schedulers typically incorporate placement policies that govern where jobs are placed on the cluster. Existing placement policies are either designed as ad-hoc heuristics or incorporated as constraints within a complex optimization problem and thus either suffer from suboptimal performance or poor scalability. Our key insight is that many placement constraints can be formulated as graph matching problems and based on that we design novel placement policies for minimizing job migration overheads and job packing. We integrate these policies into Tesserae and describe how our design leads to a scalable and effective GPU cluster scheduler. Our experimental results show that Tesserae improves average JCT by up to 1.62x and the Makespan by up to 1.15x compared with the existing schedulers.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful approach for learning visual representations without manual annotations. However, the robustness of standard SSL methods to domain shift -- systematic differences across data sources -- remains uncertain, posing an especially critical challenge in biomedical imaging where batch effects can obscure true biological signals. We present AdvDINO, a domain-adversarial self-supervised learning framework that integrates a gradient reversal layer into the DINOv2 architecture to promote domain-invariant feature learning. Applied to a real-world cohort of six-channel multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) whole slide images from non-small cell lung cancer patients, AdvDINO mitigates slide-specific biases to learn more robust and biologically meaningful representations than non-adversarial baselines. Across $>5.46$ million mIF image tiles, the model uncovers phenotype clusters with distinct proteomic profiles and prognostic significance, and improves survival prediction in attention-based multiple instance learning. While demonstrated on mIF data, AdvDINO is broadly applicable to other imaging domains -- including radiology, remote sensing, and autonomous driving -- where domain shift and limited annotated data hinder model generalization and interpretability.

Abstract: Foundation models for electroencephalography (EEG) signals have recently demonstrated success in learning generalized representations of EEGs, outperforming specialized models in various downstream tasks. However, many of these models lack transparency in their pretraining dynamics and offer limited insight into how well EEG information is preserved within their embeddings. For successful clinical integration, EEG foundation models must ensure transparency in pretraining, downstream fine-tuning, and the interpretability of learned representations. Current approaches primarily operate in the temporal domain, overlooking advancements in digital signal processing that enable the extraction of deterministic and traceable features, such as wavelet-based representations. We propose MENDR (Manifold Explainable Neural Data Representations), a filter bank-based EEG foundation model built on a novel Riemannian Manifold Transformer architecture to resolve these issues. MENDR learns symmetric positive definite matrix embeddings of EEG signals and is pretrained on a large corpus comprising over 4,000 hours of EEG data, decomposed via discrete wavelet packet transforms into multi-resolution coefficients. MENDR significantly enhances interpretability by visualizing symmetric positive definite embeddings as geometric ellipsoids and supports accurate reconstruction of EEG signals from learned embeddings. Evaluations across multiple clinical EEG tasks demonstrate that MENDR achieves near state-of-the-art performance with substantially fewer parameters, underscoring its potential for efficient, interpretable, and clinically applicable EEG analysis.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a competitive approach for novel view synthesis (NVS) due to its advanced rendering efficiency through 3D Gaussian projection and blending. However, Gaussians are treated equally weighted for rendering in most 3DGS methods, making them prone to overfitting, which is particularly the case in sparse-view scenarios. To address this, we investigate how adaptive weighting of Gaussians affects rendering quality, which is characterised by learned uncertainties proposed. This learned uncertainty serves two key purposes: first, it guides the differentiable update of Gaussian opacity while preserving the 3DGS pipeline integrity; second, the uncertainty undergoes soft differentiable dropout regularisation, which strategically transforms the original uncertainty into continuous drop probabilities that govern the final Gaussian projection and blending process for rendering. Extensive experimental results over widely adopted datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms rivals in sparse-view 3D synthesis, achieving higher quality reconstruction with fewer Gaussians in most datasets compared to existing sparse-view approaches, e.g., compared to DropGaussian, our method achieves 3.27\% PSNR improvements on the MipNeRF 360 dataset.

<title>Hierarchical Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient for Autonomous Maze Navigation of Mobile Robots</title>

Abstract: Maze navigation is a fundamental challenge in robotics, requiring agents to traverse complex environments efficiently. While the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm excels in control tasks, its performance in maze navigation suffers from sparse rewards, inefficient exploration, and long-horizon planning difficulties, often leading to low success rates and average rewards, sometimes even failing to achieve effective navigation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an efficient Hierarchical DDPG (HDDPG) algorithm, which includes high-level and low-level policies. The high-level policy employs an advanced DDPG framework to generate intermediate subgoals from a long-term perspective and on a higher temporal scale. The low-level policy, also powered by the improved DDPG algorithm, generates primitive actions by observing current states and following the subgoal assigned by the high-level policy. The proposed method enhances stability with off-policy correction, refining subgoal assignments by relabeling historical experiences. Additionally, adaptive parameter space noise is utilized to improve exploration, and a reshaped intrinsic-extrinsic reward function is employed to boost learning efficiency. Further optimizations, including gradient clipping and Xavier initialization, are employed to improve robustness. The proposed algorithm is rigorously evaluated through numerical simulation experiments executed using the Robot Operating System (ROS) and Gazebo. Regarding the three distinct final targets in autonomous maze navigation tasks, HDDPG significantly overcomes the limitations of standard DDPG and its variants, improving the success rate by at least 56.59% and boosting the average reward by a minimum of 519.03 compared to baseline algorithms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have rendered visible the fragility of contemporary knowledge infrastructures by simulating coherence while bypassing traditional modes of citation, authority, and validation. This paper introduces the Situated Epistemic Infrastructures (SEI) framework as a diagnostic tool for analyzing how knowledge becomes authoritative across hybrid human-machine systems under post-coherence conditions. Rather than relying on stable scholarly domains or bounded communities of practice, SEI traces how credibility is mediated across institutional, computational, and temporal arrangements. Integrating insights from infrastructure studies, platform theory, and epistemology, the framework foregrounds coordination over classification, emphasizing the need for anticipatory and adaptive models of epistemic stewardship. The paper contributes to debates on AI governance, knowledge production, and the ethical design of information systems by offering a robust alternative to representationalist models of scholarly communication.

Abstract: Existing unstructured data analytics systems rely on experts to write code and manage complex analysis workflows, making them both expensive and time-consuming. To address these challenges, we introduce AgenticData, an innovative agentic data analytics system that allows users to simply pose natural language (NL) questions while autonomously analyzing data sources across multiple domains, including both unstructured and structured data. First, AgenticData employs a feedback-driven planning technique that automatically converts an NL query into a semantic plan composed of relational and semantic operators. We propose a multi-agent collaboration strategy by utilizing a data profiling agent for discovering relevant data, a semantic cross-validation agent for iterative optimization based on feedback, and a smart memory agent for maintaining short-term context and long-term knowledge. Second, we propose a semantic optimization model to refine and execute semantic plans effectively. Our system, AgenticData, has been tested using three benchmarks. Experimental results showed that AgenticData achieved superior accuracy on both easy and difficult tasks, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Background: Understanding social determinants of health (SDoH) factors contributing to suicide incidents is crucial for early intervention and prevention. However, data-driven approaches to this goal face challenges such as long-tailed factor distributions, analyzing pivotal stressors preceding suicide incidents, and limited model explainability. Methods: We present a multi-stage large language model framework to enhance SDoH factor extraction from unstructured text. Our approach was compared to other state-of-the-art language models (i.e., pre-trained BioBERT and GPT-3.5-turbo) and reasoning models (i.e., DeepSeek-R1). We also evaluated how the model's explanations help people annotate SDoH factors more quickly and accurately. The analysis included both automated comparisons and a pilot user study. Results: We show that our proposed framework demonstrated performance boosts in the overarching task of extracting SDoH factors and in the finer-grained tasks of retrieving relevant context. Additionally, we show that fine-tuning a smaller, task-specific model achieves comparable or better performance with reduced inference costs. The multi-stage design not only enhances extraction but also provides intermediate explanations, improving model explainability. Conclusions: Our approach improves both the accuracy and transparency of extracting suicide-related SDoH from unstructured texts. These advancements have the potential to support early identification of individuals at risk and inform more effective prevention strategies.

Abstract: Self-evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a scalable path toward super-intelligence by autonomously generating, refining, and learning from their own experiences. However, existing methods for training such models still rely heavily on vast human-curated tasks and labels, typically via fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, which poses a fundamental bottleneck to advancing AI systems toward capabilities beyond human intelligence. To overcome this limitation, we introduce R-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates its own training data from scratch. Starting from a single base LLM, R-Zero initializes two independent models with distinct roles, a Challenger and a Solver. These models are optimized separately and co-evolve through interaction: the Challenger is rewarded for proposing tasks near the edge of the Solver capability, and the Solver is rewarded for solving increasingly challenging tasks posed by the Challenger. This process yields a targeted, self-improving curriculum without any pre-existing tasks and labels. Empirically, R-Zero substantially improves reasoning capability across different backbone LLMs, e.g., boosting the Qwen3-4B-Base by +6.49 on math-reasoning benchmarks and +7.54 on general-domain reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-based generative language models have accelerated AI-driven lyric-to-song generation. However, these models frequently suffer from content hallucination, producing outputs misaligned with the input lyrics and undermining musical coherence. Current supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approaches, limited by passive label-fitting, exhibit constrained self-improvement and poor hallucination mitigation. To address this core challenge, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework leveraging preference optimization for hallucination control. Our key contributions include: (1) Developing a robust hallucination preference dataset constructed via phoneme error rate (PER) computation and rule-based filtering to capture alignment with human expectations; (2) Implementing and evaluating three distinct preference optimization strategies within the RL framework: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). DPO operates off-policy to enhance positive token likelihood, achieving a significant 7.4% PER reduction. PPO and GRPO employ an on-policy approach, training a PER-based reward model to iteratively optimize sequences via reward maximization and KL-regularization, yielding PER reductions of 4.9% and 4.7%, respectively. Comprehensive objective and subjective evaluations confirm that our methods effectively suppress hallucinations while preserving musical quality. Crucially, this work presents a systematic, RL-based solution to hallucination control in lyric-to-song generation. The framework's transferability also unlocks potential for music style adherence and musicality enhancement, opening new avenues for future generative song research.

Abstract: Modern LLM pipelines increasingly resemble data-centric systems: they retrieve external context, compose intermediate outputs, validate results, and adapt based on runtime feedback. Yet, the central element guiding this process -- the prompt -- remains a brittle, opaque string, disconnected from the surrounding dataflow. This disconnect limits reuse, optimization, and runtime control.
  In this paper, we describe our vision and an initial design for SPEAR, a language and runtime that fills this prompt management gap by making prompts structured, adaptive, and first-class components of the execution model. SPEAR enables (1) runtime prompt refinement -- modifying prompts dynamically in response to execution-time signals such as confidence, latency, or missing context; and (2) structured prompt management -- organizing prompt fragments into versioned views with support for introspection and logging.
  SPEAR defines a prompt algebra that governs how prompts are constructed and adapted within a pipeline. It supports multiple refinement modes (manual, assisted, and automatic), giving developers a balance between control and automation. By treating prompt logic as structured data, SPEAR enables optimizations such as operator fusion, prefix caching, and view reuse. Preliminary experiments quantify the behavior of different refinement modes compared to static prompts and agentic retries, as well as the impact of prompt-level optimizations such as operator fusion.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities when fine-tuned with reinforcement learning (RL). However, such methods require extensive data and compute, making them impractical for smaller models. Current approaches to curriculum learning or data selection are largely heuristic-driven or demand extensive computational resources, limiting their scalability and generalizability. We propose \textbf{SPaRFT}, a self-paced learning framework that enables efficient learning based on the capability of the model being trained through optimizing which data to use and when. First, we apply \emph{cluster-based data reduction} to partition training data by semantics and difficulty, extracting a compact yet diverse subset that reduces redundancy. Then, a \emph{multi-armed bandit} treats data clusters as arms, optimized to allocate training samples based on model current performance. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that SPaRFT achieves comparable or better accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines while using up to \(100\times\) fewer samples. Ablation studies and analyses further highlight the importance of both data clustering and adaptive selection. Our results demonstrate that carefully curated, performance-driven training curricula can unlock strong reasoning abilities in LLMs with minimal resources.

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. Early diagnosis, accurate and timely treatment are critical to improving patient survival rates. In clinical settings, physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually generating these notes is labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout. In this work, we propose skin-SOAP, a weakly supervised multimodal framework to generate clinically structured SOAP notes from limited inputs, including lesion images and sparse clinical text. Our approach reduces reliance on manual annotations, enabling scalable, clinically grounded documentation while alleviating clinician burden and reducing the need for large annotated data. Our method achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro across key clinical relevance metrics. To evaluate this clinical relevance, we introduce two novel metrics MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score (CCS) which assess semantic alignment with expert medical concepts and input features, respectively.

Abstract: Dialogues Aspect-based Sentiment Quadruple Extraction (DiaASQ) aims to extract all target-aspect-opinion-sentiment quadruples from a given multi-round, multi-participant dialogue. Existing methods typically learn word relations across entire dialogues, assuming a uniform distribution of sentiment elements. However, we find that dialogues often contain multiple semantically independent sub-dialogues without clear dependencies between them. Therefore, learning word relationships across the entire dialogue inevitably introduces additional noise into the extraction process. To address this, our method focuses on partitioning dialogues into semantically independent sub-dialogues. Achieving completeness while minimizing these sub-dialogues presents a significant challenge. Simply partitioning based on reply relationships is ineffective. Instead, we propose utilizing a structural entropy minimization algorithm to partition the dialogues. This approach aims to preserve relevant utterances while distinguishing irrelevant ones as much as possible. Furthermore, we introduce a two-step framework for quadruple extraction: first extracting individual sentiment elements at the utterance level, then matching quadruples at the sub-dialogue level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in DiaASQ with much lower computational costs.

Abstract: Meaning Representation (AMR) is a semantic formalism that encodes sentence meaning as rooted, directed, acyclic graphs, where nodes represent concepts and edges denote semantic relations. Finetuning decoder only Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a promising novel straightfoward direction for AMR parsing. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of finetuning four distinct LLM architectures, Phi 3.5, Gemma 2, LLaMA 3.2, and DeepSeek R1 LLaMA Distilled using the LDC2020T02 Gold AMR3.0 test set. Our results have shown that straightfoward finetuning of decoder only LLMs can achieve comparable performance to complex State of the Art (SOTA) AMR parsers. Notably, LLaMA 3.2 demonstrates competitive performance against SOTA AMR parsers given a straightforward finetuning approach. We achieved SMATCH F1: 0.804 on the full LDC2020T02 test split, on par with APT + Silver (IBM) at 0.804 and approaching Graphene Smatch (MBSE) at 0.854. Across our analysis, we also observed a consistent pattern where LLaMA 3.2 leads in semantic performance while Phi 3.5 excels in structural validity.

Schemas help organize ideas and guide exploration, but they are often difficult to discover and apply, especially in complex or unfamiliar domains. My Ph.D. research develops a framework for human-AI schema discovery and application to support creative problem solving. I design systems that support users in sensemaking over examples to abstract schemas, and in operationalizing schemas into human-AI co-creative workflows for application. This research offers insights into how schema-guided interaction can make implicit knowledge more accessible and actionable, advancing more transparent and collaborative human-AI systems.

Abstract: Pre-trained weights have become a cornerstone of modern deep learning, enabling efficient knowledge transfer and improving downstream task performance, especially in data-scarce scenarios. However, a fundamental question remains: how can we obtain better pre-trained weights that encapsulate more knowledge beyond the given dataset? In this work, we introduce \textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights (KNOW)} prediction, a novel strategy that leverages structured forgetting and its inversion to synthesize knowledge-enriched weights. Our key insight is that sequential fine-tuning on progressively downsized datasets induces a structured forgetting process, which can be modeled and reversed to recover knowledge as if trained on a larger dataset. We construct a dataset of weight transitions governed by this controlled forgetting and employ meta-learning to model weight prediction effectively. Specifically, our \textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights Nowcaster (KNOWN)} acts as a hyper-model that learns the general evolution of weights and predicts enhanced weights with improved generalization. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate that KNOW prediction consistently outperforms Na\"ive fine-tuning and simple weight prediction, leading to superior downstream performance. Our work provides a new perspective on reinterpreting forgetting dynamics to push the limits of knowledge transfer in deep learning.

Abstract: Image colorization, the task of adding colors to grayscale images, has been the focus of significant research efforts in computer vision in recent years for its various application areas such as color restoration and automatic animation colorization [15, 1]. The colorization problem is challenging as it is highly ill-posed with two out of three image dimensions lost, resulting in large degrees of freedom. However, semantics of the scene as well as the surface texture could provide important cues for colors: the sky is typically blue, the clouds are typically white and the grass is typically green, and there are huge amounts of training data available for learning such priors since any colored image could serve as a training data point [20].
  Colorization is initially formulated as a regression task[5], which ignores the multi-modal nature of color prediction. In this project, we explore automatic image colorization via classification and adversarial learning. We will build our models on prior works, apply modifications for our specific scenario and make comparisons.

<title>Align-for-Fusion: Harmonizing Triple Preferences via Dual-oriented Diffusion for Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation</title>

Abstract: Personalized sequential recommendation aims to predict appropriate items for users based on their behavioral sequences. To alleviate data sparsity and interest drift issues, conventional approaches typically incorporate auxiliary behaviors from other domains via cross-domain transition. However, existing cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) methods often follow an align-then-fusion paradigm that performs representation-level alignment across multiple domains and combines them mechanically for recommendation, overlooking the fine-grained fusion of domain-specific preferences. Inspired by recent advances in diffusion models (DMs) for distribution matching, we propose an align-for-fusion framework for CDSR to harmonize triple preferences via dual-oriented DMs, termed HorizonRec. Specifically, we investigate the uncertainty injection of DMs and identify stochastic noise as a key source of instability in existing DM-based recommenders. To address this, we introduce a mixed-conditioned distribution retrieval strategy that leverages distributions retrieved from users' authentic behavioral logic as semantic bridges across domains, enabling consistent multi-domain preference modeling. Furthermore, we propose a dual-oriented preference diffusion method to suppress potential noise and emphasize target-relevant interests during multi-domain user representation fusion. Extensive experiments on four CDSR datasets from two distinct platforms demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of HorizonRec in fine-grained triple-domain preference fusion.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is essential for adapting Large Language Models (LLMs). In practice, LLMs are often required to handle a diverse set of tasks from multiple domains, a scenario naturally addressed by multi-task learning (MTL). Within this MTL context, a prevailing trend involves LoRA variants with multiple adapters or heads, which advocate for structural diversity to capture task-specific knowledge. Our findings present a direct challenge to this paradigm. We first show that a simplified multi-head architecture with high inter-head similarity substantially outperforms complex multi-adapter and multi-head systems. This leads us to question the multi-component paradigm itself, and we further demonstrate that a standard single-adapter LoRA, with a sufficiently increased rank, also achieves highly competitive performance. These results lead us to a new hypothesis: effective MTL generalization hinges on learning robust shared representations, not isolating task-specific features. To validate this, we propose Align-LoRA, which incorporates an explicit loss to align task representations within the shared adapter space. Experiments confirm that Align-LoRA significantly surpasses all baselines, establishing a simpler yet more effective paradigm for adapting LLMs to multiple tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/jinda-liu/Align-LoRA.

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks against multimodal large language Models (MLLMs) are a significant research focus. Current research predominantly focuses on maximizing attack success rate (ASR), often overlooking whether the generated responses actually fulfill the attacker's malicious intent. This oversight frequently leads to low-quality outputs that bypass safety filters but lack substantial harmful content. To address this gap, we propose JPS, \underline{J}ailbreak MLLMs with collaborative visual \underline{P}erturbation and textual \underline{S}teering, which achieves jailbreaks via corporation of visual image and textually steering prompt. Specifically, JPS utilizes target-guided adversarial image perturbations for effective safety bypass, complemented by "steering prompt" optimized via a multi-agent system to specifically guide LLM responses fulfilling the attackers' intent. These visual and textual components undergo iterative co-optimization for enhanced performance. To evaluate the quality of attack outcomes, we propose the Malicious Intent Fulfillment Rate (MIFR) metric, assessed using a Reasoning-LLM-based evaluator. Our experiments show JPS sets a new state-of-the-art in both ASR and MIFR across various MLLMs and benchmarks, with analyses confirming its efficacy.

Abstract: As an effective approach to quantify how training samples influence test sample, data attribution is crucial for understanding data and model and further enhance the transparency of machine learning models. We find that prevailing data attribution methods based on leave-one-out (LOO) strategy suffer from the local-based explanation, as these LOO-based methods only perturb a single training sample, and overlook the collective influence in the training set. On the other hand, the lack of baseline in many data attribution methods reduces the flexibility of the explanation, e.g., failing to provide counterfactual explanations. In this paper, we propose Integrated Influence, a novel data attribution method that incorporates a baseline approach. Our method defines a baseline dataset, follows a data degeneration process to transition the current dataset to the baseline, and accumulates the influence of each sample throughout this process. We provide a solid theoretical framework for our method, and further demonstrate that popular methods, such as influence functions, can be viewed as special cases of our approach. Experimental results show that Integrated Influence generates more reliable data attributions compared to existing methods in both data attribution task and mislablled example identification task.

Abstract: Dysarthric speech poses significant challenges in developing assistive technologies, primarily due to the limited availability of data. Recent advances in neural speech synthesis, especially zero-shot voice cloning, facilitate synthetic speech generation for data augmentation; however, they may introduce biases towards dysarthric speech. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art F5-TTS in cloning dysarthric speech using TORGO dataset, focusing on intelligibility, speaker similarity, and prosody preservation. We also analyze potential biases using fairness metrics like Disparate Impact and Parity Difference to assess disparities across dysarthric severity levels. Results show that F5-TTS exhibits a strong bias toward speech intelligibility over speaker and prosody preservation in dysarthric speech synthesis. Insights from this study can help integrate fairness-aware dysarthric speech synthesis, fostering the advancement of more inclusive speech technologies.

Abstract: Function calling capabilities are crucial for deploying Large Language Models in real-world applications, yet current training approaches fail to develop robust reasoning strategies. Supervised fine-tuning produces models that rely on superficial pattern matching, while standard reinforcement learning methods struggle with the complex action space of structured function calls. We present a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance group relative policy optimization through strategic entropy based exploration specifically tailored for function calling tasks. Our approach addresses three critical challenges in function calling: insufficient exploration during policy learning, lack of structured reasoning in chain-of-thought generation, and inadequate verification of parameter extraction. Our two-stage data preparation pipeline ensures high-quality training samples through iterative LLM evaluation and abstract syntax tree validation. Extensive experiments on the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard demonstrate that this framework achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models with 86.02\% overall accuracy, outperforming standard GRPO by up to 6\% on complex multi-function scenarios. Notably, our method shows particularly strong improvements on code-pretrained models, suggesting that structured language generation capabilities provide an advantageous starting point for reinforcement learning in function calling tasks. We will release all the code, models and dataset to benefit the community.

<title>Latent Expression Generation for Referring Image Segmentation and Grounding</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05123</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.05123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual grounding tasks, such as referring image segmentation (RIS) and referring expression comprehension (REC), aim to localize a target object based on a given textual description. The target object in an image can be described in multiple ways, reflecting diverse attributes such as color, position, and more. However, most existing methods rely on a single textual input, which captures only a fraction of the rich information available in the visual domain. This mismatch between rich visual details and sparse textual cues can lead to the misidentification of similar objects. To address this, we propose a novel visual grounding framework that leverages multiple latent expressions generated from a single textual input by incorporating complementary visual details absent from the original description. Specifically, we introduce subject distributor and visual concept injector modules to embed both shared-subject and distinct-attributes concepts into the latent representations, thereby capturing unique and target-specific visual cues. We also propose a positive-margin contrastive learning strategy to align all latent expressions with the original text while preserving subtle variations. Experimental results show that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art RIS and REC approaches on multiple benchmarks but also achieves outstanding performance on the generalized referring expression segmentation (GRES) benchmark.

<title>Attention Basin: Why Contextual Position Matters in Large Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.05128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is significantly sensitive to the contextual position of information in the input. To investigate the mechanism behind this positional bias, our extensive experiments reveal a consistent phenomenon we term the attention basin: when presented with a sequence of structured items (e.g., retrieved documents or few-shot examples), models systematically assign higher attention to the items at the beginning and end of the sequence, while neglecting those in the middle. Crucially, our analysis further reveals that allocating higher attention to critical information is key to enhancing model performance. Based on these insights, we introduce Attention-Driven Reranking (AttnRank), a two-stage framework that (i) estimates a model's intrinsic positional attention preferences using a small calibration set, and (ii) reorders retrieved documents or few-shot examples to align the most salient content with these high-attention positions. AttnRank is a model-agnostic, training-free, and plug-and-play method with minimal computational overhead. Experiments on multi-hop QA and few-shot in-context learning tasks demonstrate that AttnRank achieves substantial improvements across 10 large language models of varying architectures and scales, without modifying model parameters or training procedures.

Abstract: The integration of large language models into healthcare necessitates a rigorous evaluation of their ethical reasoning, an area current benchmarks often overlook. We introduce PrinciplismQA, a comprehensive benchmark with 3,648 questions designed to systematically assess LLMs' alignment with core medical ethics. Grounded in Principlism, our benchmark features a high-quality dataset. This includes multiple-choice questions curated from authoritative textbooks and open-ended questions sourced from authoritative medical ethics case study literature, all validated by medical experts. Our experiments reveal a significant gap between models' ethical knowledge and their practical application, especially in dynamically applying ethical principles to real-world scenarios. Most LLMs struggle with dilemmas concerning Beneficence, often over-emphasizing other principles. Frontier closed-source models, driven by strong general capabilities, currently lead the benchmark. Notably, medical domain fine-tuning can enhance models' overall ethical competence, but further progress requires better alignment with medical ethical knowledge. PrinciplismQA offers a scalable framework to diagnose these specific ethical weaknesses, paving the way for more balanced and responsible medical AI.

<title>FedGIN: Federated Learning with Dynamic Global Intensity Non-linear Augmentation for Organ Segmentation using Multi-modal Images</title>

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in AI-assisted diagnostics, surgical planning, and treatment monitoring. Accurate and robust segmentation models are essential for enabling reliable, data-driven clinical decision making across diverse imaging modalities. Given the inherent variability in image characteristics across modalities, developing a unified model capable of generalizing effectively to multiple modalities would be highly beneficial. This model could streamline clinical workflows and reduce the need for modality-specific training. However, real-world deployment faces major challenges, including data scarcity, domain shift between modalities (e.g., CT vs. MRI), and privacy restrictions that prevent data sharing. To address these issues, we propose FedGIN, a Federated Learning (FL) framework that enables multimodal organ segmentation without sharing raw patient data. Our method integrates a lightweight Global Intensity Non-linear (GIN) augmentation module that harmonizes modality-specific intensity distributions during local training. We evaluated FedGIN using two types of datasets: an imputed dataset and a complete dataset. In the limited dataset scenario, the model was initially trained using only MRI data, and CT data was added to assess its performance improvements. In the complete dataset scenario, both MRI and CT data were fully utilized for training on all clients. In the limited-data scenario, FedGIN achieved a 12 to 18% improvement in 3D Dice scores on MRI test cases compared to FL without GIN and consistently outperformed local baselines. In the complete dataset scenario, FedGIN demonstrated near-centralized performance, with a 30% Dice score improvement over the MRI-only baseline and a 10% improvement over the CT-only baseline, highlighting its strong cross-modality generalization under privacy constraints.

Abstract: The integration of robotics and automation into self-driving laboratories (SDLs) can introduce additional safety complexities, in addition to those that already apply to conventional research laboratories. Personal protective equipment (PPE) is an essential requirement for ensuring the safety and well-being of workers in laboratories, self-driving or otherwise. Fires are another important risk factor in chemical laboratories. In SDLs, fires that occur close to mobile robots, which use flammable lithium batteries, could have increased severity. Here, we present Chemist Eye, a distributed safety monitoring system designed to enhance situational awareness in SDLs. The system integrates multiple stations equipped with RGB, depth, and infrared cameras, designed to monitor incidents in SDLs. Chemist Eye is also designed to spot workers who have suffered a potential accident or medical emergency, PPE compliance and fire hazards. To do this, Chemist Eye uses decision-making driven by a vision-language model (VLM). Chemist Eye is designed for seamless integration, enabling real-time communication with robots. Based on the VLM recommendations, the system attempts to drive mobile robots away from potential fire locations, exits, or individuals not wearing PPE, and issues audible warnings where necessary. It also integrates with third-party messaging platforms to provide instant notifications to lab personnel. We tested Chemist Eye with real-world data from an SDL equipped with three mobile robots and found that the spotting of possible safety hazards and decision-making performances reached 97 % and 95 %, respectively.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in handling spoken inputs for high-resource languages, reaching state-of-the-art performance in various tasks. However, their applicability is still less explored in low-resource settings. This work investigates the use of Speech LLMs for low-resource Automatic Speech Recognition using the SLAM-ASR framework, where a trainable lightweight projector connects a speech encoder and a LLM. Firstly, we assess training data volume requirements to match Whisper-only performance, re-emphasizing the challenges of limited data. Secondly, we show that leveraging mono- or multilingual projectors pretrained on high-resource languages reduces the impact of data scarcity, especially with small training sets. Using multilingual LLMs (EuroLLM, Salamandra) with whisper-large-v3-turbo, we evaluate performance on several public benchmarks, providing insights for future research on optimizing Speech LLMs for low-resource languages and multilinguality.

Abstract: With the remarkable advancement of AI agents, the number of their equipped tools is increasing rapidly. However, integrating all tool information into the limited model context becomes impractical, highlighting the need for efficient tool retrieval methods. In this regard, dominant methods primarily rely on semantic similarities between tool descriptions and user queries to retrieve relevant tools. However, they often consider each tool independently, overlooking dependencies between tools, which may lead to the omission of prerequisite tools for successful task execution. To deal with this defect, in this paper, we propose Tool Graph Retriever (TGR), which exploits the dependencies among tools to learn better tool representations for retrieval. First, we construct a dataset termed TDI300K to train a discriminator for identifying tool dependencies. Then, we represent all candidate tools as a tool dependency graph and use graph convolution to integrate the dependencies into their representations. Finally, these updated tool representations are employed for online retrieval. Experimental results on several commonly used datasets show that our TGR can bring a performance improvement to existing dominant methods, achieving SOTA performance. Moreover, in-depth analyses also verify the importance of tool dependencies and the effectiveness of our TGR.

<title>FCBV-Net: Category-Level Robotic Garment Smoothing via Feature-Conditioned Bimanual Value Prediction</title>

Abstract: Category-level generalization for robotic garment manipulation, such as bimanual smoothing, remains a significant hurdle due to high dimensionality, complex dynamics, and intra-category variations. Current approaches often struggle, either overfitting with concurrently learned visual features for a specific instance or, despite category-level perceptual generalization, failing to predict the value of synergistic bimanual actions. We propose the Feature-Conditioned Bimanual Value Network (FCBV-Net), operating on 3D point clouds to specifically enhance category-level policy generalization for garment smoothing. FCBV-Net conditions bimanual action value prediction on pre-trained, frozen dense geometric features, ensuring robustness to intra-category garment variations. Trainable downstream components then learn a task-specific policy using these static features. In simulated GarmentLab experiments with the CLOTH3D dataset, FCBV-Net demonstrated superior category-level generalization. It exhibited only an 11.5% efficiency drop (Steps80) on unseen garments compared to 96.2% for a 2D image-based baseline, and achieved 89% final coverage, outperforming an 83% coverage from a 3D correspondence-based baseline that uses identical per-point geometric features but a fixed primitive. These results highlight that the decoupling of geometric understanding from bimanual action value learning enables better category-level generalization.

Abstract: For the development and optimization of agent-based models (ABMs) and rational agent-based models (RABMs), optimization algorithms such as reinforcement learning are extensively used. However, assessing the performance of RL-based ABMs and RABMS models is challenging due to the complexity and stochasticity of the modeled systems, and the lack of well-standardized metrics for comparing RL algorithms. In this study, we are developing domain-driven metrics for RL, while building on state-of-the-art metrics. We demonstrate our ``Domain-driven-RL-metrics'' using policy optimization on a rational ABM disease modeling case study to model masking behavior, vaccination, and lockdown in a pandemic. Our results show the use of domain-driven rewards in conjunction with traditional and state-of-the-art metrics for a few different simulation scenarios such as the differential availability of masks.

Abstract: Aligning LLMs with user preferences is crucial for real-world use but often requires costly fine-tuning or expensive inference, forcing trade-offs between alignment quality and computational cost. Existing inference-time methods typically ignore this balance, focusing solely on the optimized policy's performance. We propose HIA (Heuristic-Guided Inference-time Alignment), a tuning-free, black-box-compatible approach that uses a lightweight prompt optimizer, heuristic reward models, and two-stage filtering to reduce inference calls while preserving alignment quality. On real-world prompt datasets, HelpSteer and ComPRed, HIA outperforms best-of-N sampling, beam search, and greedy search baselines in multi-objective, goal-conditioned tasks under the same inference budget. We also find that HIA is effective under low-inference budgets with as little as one or two response queries, offering a practical solution for scalable, personalized LLM deployment.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly advanced code generation for large language models (LLMs). However, current paradigms rely on outcome-based rewards from test cases, neglecting the quality of the intermediate reasoning process. While supervising the reasoning process directly is a promising direction, it is highly susceptible to reward hacking, where the policy model learns to exploit the reasoning reward signal without improving final outcomes. To address this, we introduce a unified framework that can effectively incorporate the quality of the reasoning process during RL. First, to enable reasoning evaluation, we develop LCB-RB, a benchmark comprising preference pairs of superior and inferior reasoning processes. Second, to accurately score reasoning quality, we introduce an Optimized-Degraded based (OD-based) method for reward model training. This method generates high-quality preference pairs by systematically optimizing and degrading initial reasoning paths along curated dimensions of reasoning quality, such as factual accuracy, logical rigor, and coherence. A 7B parameter reward model with this method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on LCB-RB and generalizes well to other benchmarks. Finally, we introduce Posterior-GRPO (P-GRPO), a novel RL method that conditions process-based rewards on task success. By selectively applying rewards to the reasoning processes of only successful outcomes, P-GRPO effectively mitigates reward hacking and aligns the model's internal reasoning with final code correctness. A 7B parameter model with P-GRPO achieves superior performance across diverse code generation tasks, outperforming outcome-only baselines by 4.5%, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4-Turbo. We further demonstrate the generalizability of our approach by extending it to mathematical tasks. Our models, dataset, and code are publicly available.

Abstract: Achieving high-quality novel view synthesis in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) often depends on effective point primitive management. The underlying Adaptive Density Control (ADC) process addresses this issue by automating densification and pruning. Yet, the vanilla 3DGS densification strategy shows key shortcomings. To address this issue, in this paper we introduce a novel density control method, which exploits the volumes of inertia associated to each Gaussian function to guide the refinement process. Furthermore, we study the effect of both traditional Structure from Motion (SfM) and Deep Image Matching (DIM) methods for point cloud initialization. Extensive experimental evaluations on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses 3DGS in reconstruction quality, delivering encouraging performance across diverse scenes.

Abstract: Timely and effective incident response is key to managing the growing frequency of cyberattacks. However, identifying the right response actions for complex systems is a major technical challenge. A promising approach to mitigate this challenge is to use the security knowledge embedded in large language models (LLMs) to assist security operators during incident handling. Recent research has demonstrated the potential of this approach, but current methods are mainly based on prompt engineering of frontier LLMs, which is costly and prone to hallucinations. We address these limitations by presenting a novel way to use an LLM for incident response planning with reduced hallucination. Our method includes three steps: fine-tuning, information retrieval, and lookahead planning. We prove that our method generates response plans with a bounded probability of hallucination and that this probability can be made arbitrarily small at the expense of increased planning time under certain assumptions. Moreover, we show that our method is lightweight and can run on commodity hardware. We evaluate our method on logs from incidents reported in the literature. The experimental results show that our method a) achieves up to 22% shorter recovery times than frontier LLMs and b) generalizes to a broad range of incident types and response actions.

Abstract: In the realm of music recommendation, sequential recommenders have shown promise in capturing the dynamic nature of music consumption. A key characteristic of this domain is repetitive listening, where users frequently replay familiar tracks. To capture these repetition patterns, recent research has introduced Personalised Popularity Scores (PPS), which quantify user-specific preferences based on historical frequency. While PPS enhances relevance in recommendation, it often reinforces already-known content, limiting the system's ability to surface novel or serendipitous items - key elements for fostering long-term user engagement and satisfaction. To address this limitation, we build upon RecJPQ, a Transformer-based framework initially developed to improve scalability in large-item catalogues through sub-item decomposition. We repurpose RecJPQ's sub-item architecture to model personalised popularity at a finer granularity. This allows us to capture shared repetition patterns across sub-embeddings - latent structures not accessible through item-level popularity alone. We propose a novel integration of sub-ID-level personalised popularity within the RecJPQ framework, enabling explicit control over the trade-off between accuracy and personalised novelty. Our sub-ID-level PPS method (sPPS) consistently outperforms item-level PPS by achieving significantly higher personalised novelty without compromising recommendation accuracy. Code and experiments are publicly available at https://github.com/sisinflab/Sub-id-Popularity.

Abstract: We introduce **EvoGraph**, a framework that enables software systems to evolve their own source code, build pipelines, documentation, and tickets. EvoGraph represents every artefact in a typed directed graph, applies learned mutation operators driven by specialized small language models (SLMs), and selects survivors with a multi-objective fitness. On three benchmarks, EvoGraph fixes 83% of known security vulnerabilities, translates COBOL to Java with 93% functional equivalence (test verified), and maintains documentation freshness within two minutes. Experiments show a 40% latency reduction and a sevenfold drop in feature lead time compared with strong baselines. We extend our approach to **evoGraph**, leveraging language-specific SLMs for modernizing .NET, Lisp, CGI, ColdFusion, legacy Python, and C codebases, achieving 82-96% semantic equivalence across languages while reducing computational costs by 90% compared to large language models. EvoGraph's design responds to empirical failure modes in legacy modernization, such as implicit contracts, performance preservation, and integration evolution. Our results suggest a practical path toward Software 3.0, where systems adapt continuously yet remain under measurable control.

<title>FAITH: A Framework for Assessing Intrinsic Tabular Hallucinations in finance</title>

Abstract: Hallucination remains a critical challenge for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in finance. Accurate extraction and precise calculation from tabular data are essential for reliable financial analysis, since even minor numerical errors can undermine decision-making and regulatory compliance. Financial applications have unique requirements, often relying on context-dependent, numerical, and proprietary tabular data that existing hallucination benchmarks rarely capture. In this study, we develop a rigorous and scalable framework for evaluating intrinsic hallucinations in financial LLMs, conceptualized as a context-aware masked span prediction task over real-world financial documents. Our main contributions are: (1) a novel, automated dataset creation paradigm using a masking strategy; (2) a new hallucination evaluation dataset derived from S&amp;P 500 annual reports; and (3) a comprehensive evaluation of intrinsic hallucination patterns in state-of-the-art LLMs on financial tabular data. Our work provides a robust methodology for in-house LLM evaluation and serves as a critical step toward building more trustworthy and reliable financial Generative AI systems.

Abstract: We propose SpectroStream, a full-band multi-channel neural audio codec. Successor to the well-established SoundStream, SpectroStream extends its capability beyond 24 kHz monophonic audio and enables high-quality reconstruction of 48 kHz stereo music at bit rates of 4--16 kbps. This is accomplished with a new neural architecture that leverages audio representation in the time-frequency domain, which leads to better audio quality especially at higher sample rate. The model also uses a delayed-fusion strategy to handle multi-channel audio, which is crucial in balancing per-channel acoustic quality and cross-channel phase consistency.

<title>Advanced Hybrid Transformer LSTM Technique with Attention and TS Mixer for Drilling Rate of Penetration Prediction</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05210</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: The Rate of Penetration (ROP) is crucial for optimizing drilling operations; however, accurately predicting it is hindered by the complex, dynamic, and high-dimensional nature of drilling data. Traditional empirical, physics-based, and basic machine learning models often fail to capture intricate temporal and contextual relationships, resulting in suboptimal predictions and limited real-time utility. To address this gap, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning architecture integrating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Transformer encoders, Time-Series Mixer (TS-Mixer) blocks, and attention mechanisms to synergistically model temporal dependencies, static feature interactions, global context, and dynamic feature importance. Evaluated on a real-world drilling dataset, our model outperformed benchmarks (standalone LSTM, TS-Mixer, and simpler hybrids) with an R-squared score of 0.9988 and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 1.447%, as measured by standard regression metrics (R-squared, MAE, RMSE, MAPE). Model interpretability was ensured using SHAP and LIME, while actual vs. predicted curves and bias checks confirmed accuracy and fairness across scenarios. This advanced hybrid approach enables reliable real-time ROP prediction, paving the way for intelligent, cost-effective drilling optimization systems with significant operational impact.

<title>ReasoningTrack: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for Long-term Vision-Language Tracking</title>

Abstract: Vision-language tracking has received increasing attention in recent years, as textual information can effectively address the inflexibility and inaccuracy associated with specifying the target object to be tracked. Existing works either directly fuse the fixed language with vision features or simply modify using attention, however, their performance is still limited. Recently, some researchers have explored using text generation to adapt to the variations in the target during tracking, however, these works fail to provide insights into the model's reasoning process and do not fully leverage the advantages of large models, which further limits their overall performance. To address the aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a novel reasoning-based vision-language tracking framework, named ReasoningTrack, based on a pre-trained vision-language model Qwen2.5-VL. Both SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) and reinforcement learning GRPO are used for the optimization of reasoning and language generation. We embed the updated language descriptions and feed them into a unified tracking backbone network together with vision features. Then, we adopt a tracking head to predict the specific location of the target object. In addition, we propose a large-scale long-term vision-language tracking benchmark dataset, termed TNLLT, which contains 200 video sequences. 20 baseline visual trackers are re-trained and evaluated on this dataset, which builds a solid foundation for the vision-language visual tracking task. Extensive experiments on multiple vision-language tracking benchmark datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed reasoning-based natural language generation strategy. The source code of this paper will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Open_VLTrack

<title>CWEFS: Brain volume conduction effects inspired channel-wise EEG feature selection for multi-dimensional emotion recognition</title>

Abstract: Due to the intracranial volume conduction effects, high-dimensional multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG) features often contain substantial redundant and irrelevant information. This issue not only hinders the extraction of discriminative emotional representations but also compromises the real-time performance. Feature selection has been established as an effective approach to address the challenges while enhancing the transparency and interpretability of emotion recognition models. However, existing EEG feature selection research overlooks the influence of latent EEG feature structures on emotional label correlations and assumes uniform importance across various channels, directly limiting the precise construction of EEG feature selection models for multi-dimensional affective computing. To address these limitations, a novel channel-wise EEG feature selection (CWEFS) method is proposed for multi-dimensional emotion recognition. Specifically, inspired by brain volume conduction effects, CWEFS integrates EEG emotional feature selection into a shared latent structure model designed to construct a consensus latent space across diverse EEG channels. To preserve the local geometric structure, this consensus space is further integrated with the latent semantic analysis of multi-dimensional emotional labels. Additionally, CWEFS incorporates adaptive channel-weight learning to automatically determine the significance of different EEG channels in the emotional feature selection task. The effectiveness of CWEFS was validated using three popular EEG datasets with multi-dimensional emotional labels. Comprehensive experimental results, compared against nineteen feature selection methods, demonstrate that the EEG feature subsets chosen by CWEFS achieve optimal emotion recognition performance across six evaluation metrics.

Abstract: EEG based multi-dimension emotion recognition has attracted substantial research interest in human computer interfaces. However, the high dimensionality of EEG features, coupled with limited sample sizes, frequently leads to classifier overfitting and high computational complexity. Feature selection constitutes a critical strategy for mitigating these challenges. Most existing EEG feature selection methods assume complete multi-dimensional emotion labels. In practice, open acquisition environment, and the inherent subjectivity of emotion perception often result in incomplete label data, which can compromise model generalization. Additionally, existing feature selection methods for handling incomplete multi-dimensional labels primarily focus on correlations among various dimensions during label recovery, neglecting the correlation between samples in the label space and their interaction with various dimensions. To address these issues, we propose a novel incomplete multi-dimensional feature selection algorithm for EEG-based emotion recognition. The proposed method integrates an adaptive dual self-expression learning (ADSEL) with least squares regression. ADSEL establishes a bidirectional pathway between sample-level and dimension-level self-expression learning processes within the label space. It could facilitate the cross-sharing of learned information between these processes, enabling the simultaneous exploitation of effective information across both samples and dimensions for label reconstruction. Consequently, ADSEL could enhances label recovery accuracy and effectively identifies the optimal EEG feature subset for multi-dimensional emotion recognition.

<title>FDC-Net: Rethinking the association between EEG artifact removal and multi-dimensional affective computing</title>

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based emotion recognition holds significant value in affective computing and brain-computer interfaces. However, in practical applications, EEG recordings are susceptible to the effects of various physiological artifacts. Current approaches typically treat denoising and emotion recognition as independent tasks using cascaded architectures, which not only leads to error accumulation, but also fails to exploit potential synergies between these tasks. Moreover, conventional EEG-based emotion recognition models often rely on the idealized assumption of "perfectly denoised data", lacking a systematic design for noise robustness. To address these challenges, a novel framework that deeply couples denoising and emotion recognition tasks is proposed for end-to-end noise-robust emotion recognition, termed as Feedback-Driven Collaborative Network for Denoising-Classification Nexus (FDC-Net). Our primary innovation lies in establishing a dynamic collaborative mechanism between artifact removal and emotion recognition through: (1) bidirectional gradient propagation with joint optimization strategies; (2) a gated attention mechanism integrated with frequency-adaptive Transformer using learnable band-position encoding. Two most popular EEG-based emotion datasets (DEAP and DREAMER) with multi-dimensional emotional labels were employed to compare the artifact removal and emotion recognition performance between ASLSL and nine state-of-the-art methods. In terms of the denoising task, FDC-Net obtains a maximum correlation coefficient (CC) value of 96.30% on DEAP and a maximum CC value of 90.31% on DREAMER. In terms of the emotion recognition task under physiological artifact interference, FDC-Net achieves emotion recognition accuracies of 82.3+7.1% on DEAP and 88.1+0.8% on DREAMER.

Abstract: The surge in rich multimodal content on social media platforms has greatly advanced Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), with Large Language Models (LLMs) further accelerating progress in this field. Current approaches primarily leverage the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of parameter-heavy (Multimodal) LLMs for sentiment classification, overlooking autonomous multimodal sentiment reasoning generation in resource-constrained environments. Therefore, we focus on the Resource-Limited Joint Multimodal Sentiment Reasoning and Classification task, JMSRC, which simultaneously performs multimodal sentiment reasoning chain generation and sentiment classification only with a lightweight model. We propose a Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Distillation model, MulCoT-RD, designed for JMSRC that employs a "Teacher-Assistant-Student" distillation paradigm to address deployment constraints in resource-limited environments. We first leverage a high-performance Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate the initial reasoning dataset and train a medium-sized assistant model with a multi-task learning mechanism. A lightweight student model is jointly trained to perform efficient multimodal sentiment reasoning generation and classification. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that MulCoT-RD with only 3B parameters achieves strong performance on JMSRC, while exhibiting robust generalization and enhanced interpretability.

Abstract: This report synthesizes eight seminal papers on the zero-shot adversarial robustness of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP. A central challenge in this domain is the inherent trade-off between enhancing adversarial robustness and preserving the model's zero-shot generalization capabilities. We analyze two primary defense paradigms: Adversarial Fine-Tuning (AFT), which modifies model parameters, and Training-Free/Test-Time Defenses, which preserve them. We trace the evolution from alignment-preserving methods (TeCoA) to embedding space re-engineering (LAAT, TIMA), and from input heuristics (AOM, TTC) to latent-space purification (CLIPure). Finally, we identify key challenges and future directions including hybrid defense strategies and adversarial pre-training.

Abstract: Level 3 automated driving systems allows drivers to engage in secondary tasks while diminishing their perception of risk. In the event of an emergency necessitating driver intervention, the system will alert the driver with a limited window for reaction and imposing a substantial cognitive burden. To address this challenge, this study employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to assist drivers in maintaining an appropriate attention on road conditions through a "humanized" persuasive advice. Our tool leverages the road conditions encountered by Level 3 systems as triggers, proactively steering driver behavior via both visual and auditory routes. Empirical study indicates that our tool is effective in sustaining driver attention with reduced cognitive load and coordinating secondary tasks with takeover behavior. Our work provides insights into the potential of using LLMs to support drivers during multi-task automated driving.

Abstract: Structured pruning is one of the representative techniques for compressing large language models (LLMs) to reduce GPU memory consumption and accelerate inference speed. It offers significant practical value in improving the efficiency of LLMs in real-world applications. Current structured pruning methods typically rely on assessment of the importance of the structure units and pruning the units with less importance. Most of them overlooks the interaction and collaboration among artificial neurons that are crucial for the functionalities of LLMs, leading to a disruption in the macro functional architecture of LLMs and consequently a pruning performance degradation. Inspired by the inherent similarities between artificial neural networks and functional neural networks in the human brain, we alleviate this challenge and propose to prune LLMs by identifying and preserving functional networks within LLMs in this study. To achieve this, we treat an LLM as a digital brain and decompose the LLM into functional networks, analogous to identifying functional brain networks in neuroimaging data. Afterwards, an LLM is pruned by preserving the key neurons within these functional networks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully identify and locate functional networks and key neurons in LLMs, enabling efficient model pruning.

Abstract: Medical image understanding plays a crucial role in enabling automated diagnosis and data-driven clinical decision support. However, its progress is impeded by two primary challenges: the limited availability of high-quality annotated medical data and an overreliance on global image features, which often miss subtle but clinically significant pathological regions. To address these issues, we introduce RegionMed-CLIP, a region-aware multimodal contrastive learning framework that explicitly incorporates localized pathological signals along with holistic semantic representations. The core of our method is an innovative region-of-interest (ROI) processor that adaptively integrates fine-grained regional features with the global context, supported by a progressive training strategy that enhances hierarchical multimodal alignment. To enable large-scale region-level representation learning, we construct MedRegion-500k, a comprehensive medical image-text corpus that features extensive regional annotations and multilevel clinical descriptions. Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval, zero-shot classification, and visual question answering tasks demonstrate that RegionMed-CLIP consistently exceeds state-of-the-art vision language models by a wide margin. Our results highlight the critical importance of region-aware contrastive pre-training and position RegionMed-CLIP as a robust foundation for advancing multimodal medical image understanding.

Abstract: Gender classification is attractive in a range of applications, including surveillance and monitoring, corporate profiling, and human-computer interaction. Individuals' identities may be gleaned from information about their gender, which is a kind of soft biometric.Over the years, several methods for determining a person's gender have been devised. Some of the most well-known ones are based on physical characteristics like face, fingerprint, palmprint, DNA, ears, gait, and iris. On the other hand, facial features account for the vast majority of gender classification methods. Also, the iris is a significant biometric trait because the iris, according to research, remains basically constant during an individual's life. Besides that, the iris is externally visible and is non-invasive to the user, which is important for practical applications. Furthermore, there are already high-quality methods for segmenting and encoding iris images, and the current methods facilitate selecting and extracting attribute vectors from iris textures. This study discusses several approaches to determining gender. The previous works of literature are briefly reviewed. Additionally, there are a variety of methodologies for different steps of gender classification. This study provides researchers with knowledge and analysis of the existing gender classification approaches. Also, it will assist researchers who are interested in this specific area, as well as highlight the gaps and challenges in the field, and finally provide suggestions and future paths for improvement.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has begun incorporating rich information from 2D foundation models. However, most approaches rely on a bottom-up optimization process that treats raw 2D features as ground truth, incurring increased computational costs. We propose a top-down pipeline for constructing compact and fast 3D Gaussian feature fields, namely, CF3. We first perform a fast weighted fusion of multi-view 2D features with pre-trained Gaussians. This approach enables training a per-Gaussian autoencoder directly on the lifted features, instead of training autoencoders in the 2D domain. As a result, the autoencoder better aligns with the feature distribution. More importantly, we introduce an adaptive sparsification method that optimizes the Gaussian attributes of the feature field while pruning and merging the redundant Gaussians, constructing an efficient representation with preserved geometric details. Our approach achieves a competitive 3D feature field using as little as 5% of the Gaussians compared to Feature-3DGS.

Abstract: Marine chlorophyll concentration is an important indicator of ecosystem health and carbon cycle strength, and its accurate prediction is crucial for red tide warning and ecological response. In this paper, we propose a LSTM-RF hybrid model that combines the advantages of LSTM and RF, which solves the deficiencies of a single model in time-series modelling and nonlinear feature portrayal. Trained with multi-source ocean data(temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, etc.), the experimental results show that the LSTM-RF model has an R^2 of 0.5386, an MSE of 0.005806, and an MAE of 0.057147 on the test set, which is significantly better than using LSTM (R^2 = 0.0208) and RF (R^2 =0.4934) alone , respectively. The standardised treatment and sliding window approach improved the prediction accuracy of the model and provided an innovative solution for high-frequency prediction of marine ecological variables.

Abstract: Intraoperative fluorescent cardiac imaging enables quality control following coronary bypass grafting surgery. We can estimate local quantitative indicators, such as cardiac perfusion, by tracking local feature points. However, heart motion and significant fluctuations in image characteristics caused by vessel structural enrichment limit traditional tracking methods. We propose a particle filtering tracker based on cyclicconsistency checks to robustly track particles sampled to follow target landmarks. Our method tracks 117 targets simultaneously at 25.4 fps, allowing real-time estimates during interventions. It achieves a tracking error of (5.00 +/- 0.22 px) and outperforms other deep learning trackers (22.3 +/- 1.1 px) and conventional trackers (58.1 +/- 27.1 px).

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) aims to combine the thermal radiation information from infrared images with the rich texture details from visible images to enhance perceptual capabilities for downstream visual tasks. However, existing methods often fail to preserve key targets due to a lack of deep semantic understanding of the scene, while the fusion process itself can also introduce artifacts and detail loss, severely compromising both image quality and task performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes SGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core of our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as explicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a conditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a two-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal features, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the preliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's coarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only has explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDFuse achieves state-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations, as well as in its adaptability to downstream tasks, providing a powerful solution to the core challenges in image fusion. The code of SGDFuse is available at https://github.com/boshizhang123/SGDFuse.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have transformed natural language processing, but their success has not yet translated to time series forecasting. Existing time series foundation models (TSFMs), often based on transformer variants, struggle with generalization across varying context and target lengths, lack adaptability to different sampling rates, and are computationally inefficient. We introduce FlowState, a novel TSFM architecture that addresses these challenges through two key innovations: a state space model (SSM) based encoder and a functional basis decoder. This design enables continuous-time modeling and dynamic time-scale adjustment, allowing FlowState to inherently generalize across all possible temporal resolutions, and dynamically adjust the forecasting horizons. In contrast to other state-of-the-art TSFMs, which require training data across all possible sampling rates to memorize patterns at each scale, FlowState inherently adapts its internal dynamics to the input scale, enabling smaller models, reduced data requirements, and improved efficiency. We further propose an efficient pretraining strategy that improves robustness and accelerates training. Despite being the smallest model, FlowState outperforms all other models and is state-of-the-art for the GIFT-ZS and the Chronos-ZS benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of its components, and we demonstrate its unique ability to adapt online to varying input sampling rates.

Abstract: Foundation models, including large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), have recently enabled novel approaches to robot autonomy and human-robot interfaces. In parallel, vision-language-action models (VLAs) or large behavior models (BLMs) are increasing the dexterity and capabilities of robotic systems. This survey paper focuses on those words advancing towards agentic applications and architectures. This includes initial efforts exploring GPT-style interfaces to tooling, as well as more complex system where AI agents are coordinators, planners, perception actors, or generalist interfaces. Such agentic architectures allow robots to reason over natural language instructions, invoke APIs, plan task sequences, or assist in operations and diagnostics. In addition to peer-reviewed research, due to the fast-evolving nature of the field, we highlight and include community-driven projects, ROS packages, and industrial frameworks that show emerging trends. We propose a taxonomy for classifying model integration approaches and present a comparative analysis of the role that agents play in different solutions in today's literature.

<title>VS-LLM: Visual-Semantic Depression Assessment based on LLM for Drawing Projection Test</title>

Abstract: The Drawing Projection Test (DPT) is an essential tool in art therapy, allowing psychologists to assess participants' mental states through their sketches. Specifically, through sketches with the theme of "a person picking an apple from a tree (PPAT)", it can be revealed whether the participants are in mental states such as depression. Compared with scales, the DPT can enrich psychologists' understanding of an individual's mental state. However, the interpretation of the PPAT is laborious and depends on the experience of the psychologists. To address this issue, we propose an effective identification method to support psychologists in conducting a large-scale automatic DPT. Unlike traditional sketch recognition, DPT more focus on the overall evaluation of the sketches, such as color usage and space utilization. Moreover, PPAT imposes a time limit and prohibits verbal reminders, resulting in low drawing accuracy and a lack of detailed depiction. To address these challenges, we propose the following efforts: (1) Providing an experimental environment for automated analysis of PPAT sketches for depression assessment; (2) Offering a Visual-Semantic depression assessment based on LLM (VS-LLM) method; (3) Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves by 17.6% compared to the psychologist assessment method. We anticipate that this work will contribute to the research in mental state assessment based on PPAT sketches' elements recognition. Our datasets and codes are available at https://github.com/wmeiqi/VS-LLM.

<title>Estimating Musical Surprisal from Audio in Autoregressive Diffusion Model Noise Spaces</title>

Abstract: Recently, the information content (IC) of predictions from a Generative Infinite-Vocabulary Transformer (GIVT) has been used to model musical expectancy and surprisal in audio. We investigate the effectiveness of such modelling using IC calculated with autoregressive diffusion models (ADMs). We empirically show that IC estimates of models based on two different diffusion ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describe diverse data better, in terms of negative log-likelihood, than a GIVT. We evaluate diffusion model IC's effectiveness in capturing surprisal aspects by examining two tasks: (1) capturing monophonic pitch surprisal, and (2) detecting segment boundaries in multi-track audio. In both tasks, the diffusion models match or exceed the performance of a GIVT. We hypothesize that the surprisal estimated at different diffusion process noise levels corresponds to the surprisal of music and audio features present at different audio granularities. Testing our hypothesis, we find that, for appropriate noise levels, the studied musical surprisal tasks' results improve. Code is provided on github.com/SonyCSLParis/audioic.

Abstract: Human teaching effort is a significant bottleneck for the broader applicability of interactive imitation learning. To reduce the number of required queries, existing methods employ active learning to query the human teacher only in uncertain, risky, or novel situations. However, during these queries, the novice's planned actions are not utilized despite containing valuable information, such as the novice's capabilities, as well as corresponding uncertainty levels. To this end, we allow the novice to say: "I plan to do this, but I am uncertain." We introduce the Active Skill-level Data Aggregation (ASkDAgger) framework, which leverages teacher feedback on the novice plan in three key ways: (1) S-Aware Gating (SAG): Adjusts the gating threshold to track sensitivity, specificity, or a minimum success rate; (2) Foresight Interactive Experience Replay (FIER), which recasts valid and relabeled novice action plans into demonstrations; and (3) Prioritized Interactive Experience Replay (PIER), which prioritizes replay based on uncertainty, novice success, and demonstration age. Together, these components balance query frequency with failure incidence, reduce the number of required demonstration annotations, improve generalization, and speed up adaptation to changing domains. We validate the effectiveness of ASkDAgger through language-conditioned manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world environments. Code, data, and videos are available at https://askdagger.github.io.

Abstract: Recently, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proposed to expand internal knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating external knowledge databases into the generation process, which is widely used for knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. Despite impressive advancements, vanilla RAG-based VQA methods that rely on unstructured documents and overlook the structural relationships among knowledge elements frequently introduce irrelevant or misleading content, reducing answer accuracy and reliability. To overcome these challenges, a promising solution is to integrate multimodal knowledge graphs (KGs) into RAG-based VQA frameworks to enhance the generation by introducing structured multimodal knowledge. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel multimodal knowledge-augmented generation framework (mKG-RAG) based on multimodal KGs for knowledge-intensive VQA tasks. Specifically, our approach leverages MLLM-powered keyword extraction and vision-text matching to distill semantically consistent and modality-aligned entities/relationships from multimodal documents, constructing high-quality multimodal KGs as structured knowledge representations. In addition, a dual-stage retrieval strategy equipped with a question-aware multimodal retriever is introduced to improve retrieval efficiency while refining precision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for knowledge-based VQA.

<title>Efficient Reasoning for Large Reasoning Language Models via Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression</title>

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs) employ long chain-of-thought reasoning with complex reflection behaviors, typically signaled by specific trigger words (e.g., "Wait" and "Alternatively") to enhance performance. However, these reflection behaviors can lead to the overthinking problem where the generation of redundant reasoning steps that unnecessarily increase token usage, raise inference costs, and reduce practical utility. In this paper, we propose Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression (CGRS), a novel method that mitigates overthinking in LRLMs while maintaining reasoning accuracy. CGRS operates by dynamically suppressing the model's generation of reflection triggers when it exhibits high confidence in its current response, thereby preventing redundant reflection cycles without compromising output quality. Our approach is model-agnostic, requires no retraining or architectural modifications, and can be integrated seamlessly with existing autoregressive generation pipelines. Extensive experiments across four reasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME24, AMC23, MATH500, and GPQA-D) demonstrate CGRS's effectiveness: it reduces token usage by an average of 18.5% to 41.9% while preserving accuracy. It also achieves the optimal balance between length reduction and performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results hold consistently across model architectures (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill series, QwQ-32B, and Qwen3 family) and scales (4B to 32B parameters), highlighting CGRS's practical value for efficient reasoning.

Abstract: Teaching robots dexterous skills from human videos remains challenging due to the reliance on low-level trajectory imitation, which fails to generalize across object types, spatial layouts, and manipulator configurations. We propose Graph-Fused Vision-Language-Action (GF-VLA), a framework that enables dual-arm robotic systems to perform task-level reasoning and execution directly from RGB and Depth human demonstrations. GF-VLA first extracts Shannon-information-based cues to identify hands and objects with the highest task relevance, then encodes these cues into temporally ordered scene graphs that capture both hand-object and object-object interactions. These graphs are fused with a language-conditioned transformer that generates hierarchical behavior trees and interpretable Cartesian motion commands. To improve execution efficiency in bimanual settings, we further introduce a cross-hand selection policy that infers optimal gripper assignment without explicit geometric reasoning. We evaluate GF-VLA on four structured dual-arm block assembly tasks involving symbolic shape construction and spatial generalization. Experimental results show that the information-theoretic scene representation achieves over 95 percent graph accuracy and 93 percent subtask segmentation, supporting the LLM planner in generating reliable and human-readable task policies. When executed by the dual-arm robot, these policies yield 94 percent grasp success, 89 percent placement accuracy, and 90 percent overall task success across stacking, letter-building, and geometric reconfiguration scenarios, demonstrating strong generalization and robustness across diverse spatial and semantic variations.

Abstract: The sequential recommendation system utilizes historical user interactions to predict preferences. Effectively integrating diverse user behavior patterns with rich multimodal information of items to enhance the accuracy of sequential recommendations is an emerging and challenging research direction. This paper focuses on the problem of multi-modal multi-behavior sequential recommendation, aiming to address the following challenges: (1) the lack of effective characterization of modal preferences across different behaviors, as user attention to different item modalities varies depending on the behavior; (2) the difficulty of effectively mitigating implicit noise in user behavior, such as unintended actions like accidental clicks; (3) the inability to handle modality noise in multi-modal representations, which further impacts the accurate modeling of user preferences. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Multi-Behavior Sequential Recommendation model (M$^3$BSR). This model first removes noise in multi-modal representations using a Conditional Diffusion Modality Denoising Layer. Subsequently, it utilizes deep behavioral information to guide the denoising of shallow behavioral data, thereby alleviating the impact of noise in implicit feedback through Conditional Diffusion Behavior Denoising. Finally, by introducing a Multi-Expert Interest Extraction Layer, M$^3$BSR explicitly models the common and specific interests across behaviors and modalities to enhance recommendation performance. Experimental results indicate that M$^3$BSR significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.

<title>PriorRG: Prior-Guided Contrastive Pre-training and Coarse-to-Fine Decoding for Chest X-ray Report Generation</title>

Abstract: Chest X-ray report generation aims to reduce radiologists' workload by automatically producing high-quality preliminary reports. A critical yet underexplored aspect of this task is the effective use of patient-specific prior knowledge -- including clinical context (e.g., symptoms, medical history) and the most recent prior image -- which radiologists routinely rely on for diagnostic reasoning. Most existing methods generate reports from single images, neglecting this essential prior information and thus failing to capture diagnostic intent or disease progression. To bridge this gap, we propose PriorRG, a novel chest X-ray report generation framework that emulates real-world clinical workflows via a two-stage training pipeline. In Stage 1, we introduce a prior-guided contrastive pre-training scheme that leverages clinical context to guide spatiotemporal feature extraction, allowing the model to align more closely with the intrinsic spatiotemporal semantics in radiology reports. In Stage 2, we present a prior-aware coarse-to-fine decoding for report generation that progressively integrates patient-specific prior knowledge with the vision encoder's hidden states. This decoding allows the model to align with diagnostic focus and track disease progression, thereby enhancing the clinical accuracy and fluency of the generated reports. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-CXR and MIMIC-ABN datasets demonstrate that PriorRG outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 3.6% BLEU-4 and 3.8% F1 score improvement on MIMIC-CXR, and a 5.9% BLEU-1 gain on MIMIC-ABN. Code and checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: There has been rapid development in generative AI tools across the education sector, which in turn is leading to increased adoption by teachers. However, this raises concerns regarding the safety and age-appropriateness of the AI-generated content that is being created for use in classrooms. This paper explores Oak National Academy's approach to addressing these concerns within the development of the UK Government's first publicly available generative AI tool - our AI-powered lesson planning assistant (Aila). Aila is intended to support teachers planning national curriculum-aligned lessons that are appropriate for pupils aged 5-16 years. To mitigate safety risks associated with AI-generated content we have implemented four key safety guardrails - (1) prompt engineering to ensure AI outputs are generated within pedagogically sound and curriculum-aligned parameters, (2) input threat detection to mitigate attacks, (3) an Independent Asynchronous Content Moderation Agent (IACMA) to assess outputs against predefined safety categories, and (4) taking a human-in-the-loop approach, to encourage teachers to review generated content before it is used in the classroom. Through our on-going evaluation of these safety guardrails we have identified several challenges and opportunities to take into account when implementing and testing safety guardrails. This paper highlights ways to build more effective safety guardrails in generative AI education tools including the on-going iteration and refinement of guardrails, as well as enabling cross-sector collaboration through sharing both open-source code, datasets and learnings.

Abstract: Corpus Aware Training (CAT) leverages valuable corpus metadata during training by injecting corpus information into each training example, and has been found effective in the literature, commonly known as the "tagging" approach. Models trained with CAT inherently learn the quality, domain and nuance between corpora directly from data, and can easily switch to different inference behavior. To achieve the best evaluation, CAT models pre-define a group of high quality data before training starts which can be error-prone and inefficient. In this work, we propose Optimal Corpus Aware Training (OCAT), which fine-tunes a CAT pre-trained model by freezing most of the model parameters and only tuning small set of corpus-related parameters. We show that OCAT is lightweight, resilient to overfitting, and effective in boosting model accuracy. We use WMT23 English to Chinese and English to German translation tasks as our test ground and show +3.6 and +1.8 chrF improvement, respectively, over vanilla training. Furthermore, our approach is on-par or slightly better than other state-of-the-art fine-tuning techniques while being less sensitive to hyperparameter settings.

Abstract: Modern RL-based post-training for large language models (LLMs) co-locate trajectory sampling and policy optimisation on the same GPU cluster, forcing the system to switch between inference and training workloads. This serial context switching violates the single-program-multiple-data (SPMD) assumption underlying today's distributed training systems. We present Echo, the RL system that cleanly decouples these two phases across heterogeneous "inference" and "training" swarms while preserving statistical efficiency. Echo introduces two lightweight synchronization protocols: a sequential pull mode that refreshes sampler weights on every API call for minimal bias, and an asynchronous push-pull mode that streams version-tagged rollouts through a replay buffer to maximise hardware utilisation. Training three representative RL workloads with Qwen3-4B, Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen3-32B on a geographically distributed cluster, Echo matches a fully co-located Verl baseline in convergence speed and final reward while off-loading trajectory generation to commodity edge hardware. These promising results demonstrate that large-scale RL for LLMs could achieve datacentre-grade performance using decentralised, heterogeneous resources.

Abstract: Diffusion Policies have demonstrated impressive performance in robotic manipulation tasks. However, their long inference time, resulting from an extensive iterative denoising process, and the need to execute an action chunk before the next prediction to maintain consistent actions limit their applicability to latency-critical tasks or simple tasks with a short cycle time. While recent methods explored distillation or alternative policy structures to accelerate inference, these often demand additional training, which can be resource-intensive for large robotic models. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach inspired by the Real-Time Iteration (RTI) Scheme, a method from optimal control that accelerates optimization by leveraging solutions from previous time steps as initial guesses for subsequent iterations. We explore the application of this scheme in diffusion inference and propose a scaling-based method to effectively handle discrete actions, such as grasping, in robotic manipulation. The proposed scheme significantly reduces runtime computational costs without the need for distillation or policy redesign. This enables a seamless integration into many pre-trained diffusion-based models, in particular, to resource-demanding large models. We also provide theoretical conditions for the contractivity which could be useful for estimating the initial denoising step. Quantitative results from extensive simulation experiments show a substantial reduction in inference time, with comparable overall performance compared with Diffusion Policy using full-step denoising.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has been actively studied using Diffusion Models and Autoregressive Models. Recently, Masked Generative Transformers have gained attention as an alternative to Autoregressive Models to overcome the inherent limitations of causal attention and autoregressive decoding through bidirectional attention and parallel decoding, enabling efficient and high-quality image generation. However, compositional T2I generation remains challenging, as even state-of-the-art Diffusion Models often fail to accurately bind attributes and achieve proper text-image alignment. While Diffusion Models have been extensively studied for this issue, Masked Generative Transformers exhibit similar limitations but have not been explored in this context. To address this, we propose Unmasking with Contrastive Attention Guidance (UNCAGE), a novel training-free method that improves compositional fidelity by leveraging attention maps to prioritize the unmasking of tokens that clearly represent individual objects. UNCAGE consistently improves performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations across multiple benchmarks and metrics, with negligible inference overhead. Our code is available at https://github.com/furiosa-ai/uncage.

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) exhibit broad utility but face limitations in quantum sensor development, stemming from interdisciplinary knowledge barriers and involving complex optimization processes. Here we present QCopilot, an LLM-based multi-agent framework integrating external knowledge access, active learning, and uncertainty quantification for quantum sensor design and diagnosis. Comprising commercial LLMs with few-shot prompt engineering and vector knowledge base, QCopilot employs specialized agents to adaptively select optimization methods, automate modeling analysis, and independently perform problem diagnosis. Applying QCopilot to atom cooling experiments, we generated 10${}^{\rm{8}}$ sub-$\rm{\mu}$K atoms without any human intervention within a few hours, representing $\sim$100$\times$ speedup over manual experimentation. Notably, by continuously accumulating prior knowledge and enabling dynamic modeling, QCopilot can autonomously identify anomalous parameters in multi-parameter experimental settings. Our work reduces barriers to large-scale quantum sensor deployment and readily extends to other quantum information systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit cultural biases due to training data dominated by high-resource languages like English and Chinese. This poses challenges for accurately representing and evaluating diverse cultural contexts, particularly in low-resource language settings. To address this, we introduce MyCulture, a benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate LLMs on Malaysian culture across six pillars: arts, attire, customs, entertainment, food, and religion presented in Bahasa Melayu. Unlike conventional benchmarks, MyCulture employs a novel open-ended multiple-choice question format without predefined options, thereby reducing guessing and mitigating format bias. We provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of this open-ended structure in improving both fairness and discriminative power. Furthermore, we analyze structural bias by comparing model performance on structured versus free-form outputs, and assess language bias through multilingual prompt variations. Our evaluation across a range of regional and international LLMs reveals significant disparities in cultural comprehension, highlighting the urgent need for culturally grounded and linguistically inclusive benchmarks in the development and assessment of LLMs.

Abstract: Language-image pre-training (LIP) enables the development of vision-language models capable of zero-shot classification, localization, multimodal retrieval, and semantic understanding. Various explanation methods have been proposed to visualize the importance of input image-text pairs on the model's similarity outputs. However, popular saliency maps are limited by capturing only first-order attributions, overlooking the complex cross-modal interactions intrinsic to such encoders. We introduce faithful interaction explanations of LIP models (FIxLIP) as a unified approach to decomposing the similarity in vision-language encoders. FIxLIP is rooted in game theory, where we analyze how using the weighted Banzhaf interaction index offers greater flexibility and improves computational efficiency over the Shapley interaction quantification framework. From a practical perspective, we propose how to naturally extend explanation evaluation metrics, like the pointing game and area between the insertion/deletion curves, to second-order interaction explanations. Experiments on MS COCO and ImageNet-1k benchmarks validate that second-order methods like FIxLIP outperform first-order attribution methods. Beyond delivering high-quality explanations, we demonstrate the utility of FIxLIP in comparing different models like CLIP vs. SigLIP-2 and ViT-B/32 vs. ViT-L/16.

<title>Tail-Risk-Safe Monte Carlo Tree Search under PAC-Level Guarantees</title>

Abstract: Making decisions with respect to just the expected returns in Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) cannot account for the potential range of high-risk, adverse outcomes associated with a decision. To this end, safety-aware MCTS often consider some constrained variants -- by introducing some form of mean risk measures or hard cost thresholds. These approaches fail to provide rigorous tail-safety guarantees with respect to extreme or high-risk outcomes (denoted as tail-risk), potentially resulting in serious consequence in high-stake scenarios. This paper addresses the problem by developing two novel solutions. We first propose CVaR-MCTS, which embeds a coherent tail risk measure, Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), into MCTS. Our CVaR-MCTS with parameter $\alpha$ achieves explicit tail-risk control over the expected loss in the "worst $(1-\alpha)\%$ scenarios." Second, we further address the estimation bias of tail-risk due to limited samples. We propose Wasserstein-MCTS (or W-MCTS) by introducing a first-order Wasserstein ambiguity set $\mathcal{P}_{\varepsilon_{s}}(s,a)$ with radius $\varepsilon_{s}$ to characterize the uncertainty in tail-risk estimates. We prove PAC tail-safety guarantees for both CVaR-MCTS and W-MCTS and establish their regret. Evaluations on diverse simulated environments demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform existing baselines, effectively achieving robust tail-risk guarantees with improved rewards and stability.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable energy time series prediction is of great significance for power generation planning and allocation. At present, deep learning time series prediction has become the mainstream method. However, the multi-scale time dynamics and the irregularity of real data lead to the limitations of the existing methods. Therefore, we propose EnergyPatchTST, which is an extension of the Patch Time Series Transformer specially designed for energy forecasting. The main innovations of our method are as follows: (1) multi-scale feature extraction mechanism to capture patterns with different time resolutions; (2) probability prediction framework to estimate uncertainty through Monte Carlo elimination; (3) integration path of future known variables (such as temperature and wind conditions); And (4) Pre-training and Fine-tuning examples to enhance the performance of limited energy data sets. A series of experiments on common energy data sets show that EnergyPatchTST is superior to other commonly used methods, the prediction error is reduced by 7-12%, and reliable uncertainty estimation is provided, which provides an important reference for time series prediction in the energy field.

Abstract: Neural networks excel across a wide range of tasks, yet remain black boxes. In particular, how their internal representations are shaped by the complexity of the input data and the problems they solve remains obscure. In this work, we introduce a suite of five data-agnostic probes-pruning, binarization, noise injection, sign flipping, and bipartite network randomization-to quantify how task difficulty influences the topology and robustness of representations in multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). MLPs are represented as signed, weighted bipartite graphs from a network science perspective. We contrast easy and hard classification tasks on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. We show that binarizing weights in hard-task models collapses accuracy to chance, whereas easy-task models remain robust. We also find that pruning low-magnitude edges in binarized hard-task models reveals a sharp phase-transition in performance. Moreover, moderate noise injection can enhance accuracy, resembling a stochastic-resonance effect linked to optimal sign flips of small-magnitude weights. Finally, preserving only the sign structure-instead of precise weight magnitudes-through bipartite network randomizations suffices to maintain high accuracy. These phenomena define a model- and modality-agnostic measure of task complexity: the performance gap between full-precision and binarized or shuffled neural network performance. Our findings highlight the crucial role of signed bipartite topology in learned representations and suggest practical strategies for model compression and interpretability that align with task complexity.

Abstract: LLM-powered code generation has the potential to revolutionize creative coding endeavors, such as live-coding, by enabling users to focus on structural motifs over syntactic details. In such domains, when prompting an LLM, users may benefit from considering multiple varied code candidates to better realize their musical intentions. Code generation models, however, struggle to present unique and diverse code candidates, with no direct insight into the code's audio output. To better establish a relationship between code candidates and produced audio, we investigate the topology of the mapping between code and audio embedding spaces. We find that code and audio embeddings do not exhibit a simple linear relationship, but supplement this with a constructed predictive model that shows an embedding alignment map could be learned. Supplementing the aim for musically diverse output, we present a model that given code predicts output audio embedding, constructing a code-audio embedding alignment map.

Abstract: Multimodal electronic health record (EHR) data provide richer, complementary insights into patient health compared to single-modality data. However, effectively integrating diverse data modalities for clinical prediction modeling remains challenging due to the substantial data requirements. We introduce a novel architecture, Mixture-of-Multimodal-Agents (MoMA), designed to leverage multiple large language model (LLM) agents for clinical prediction tasks using multimodal EHR data. MoMA employs specialized LLM agents ("specialist agents") to convert non-textual modalities, such as medical images and laboratory results, into structured textual summaries. These summaries, together with clinical notes, are combined by another LLM ("aggregator agent") to generate a unified multimodal summary, which is then used by a third LLM ("predictor agent") to produce clinical predictions. Evaluating MoMA on three prediction tasks using real-world datasets with different modality combinations and prediction settings, MoMA outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its enhanced accuracy and flexibility across various tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet exhibit critical limitations in knowledge-intensive tasks, often generating hallucinations when faced with questions requiring specialized expertise. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating external knowledge, it struggles with complex reasoning scenarios due to its reliance on direct semantic retrieval and lack of structured logical organization. Inspired by Cartesian principles from \textit{Discours de la m\'ethode}, this paper introduces Logic-Augmented Generation (LAG), a novel paradigm that reframes knowledge augmentation through systematic question decomposition and dependency-aware reasoning. Specifically, LAG first decomposes complex questions into atomic sub-questions ordered by logical dependencies. It then resolves these sequentially, using prior answers to guide context retrieval for subsequent sub-questions, ensuring stepwise grounding in logical chain. To prevent error propagation, LAG incorporates a logical termination mechanism that halts inference upon encountering unanswerable sub-questions and reduces wasted computation on excessive reasoning. Finally, it synthesizes all sub-resolutions to generate verified responses. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that LAG significantly enhances reasoning robustness, reduces hallucination, and aligns LLM problem-solving with human cognition, offering a principled alternative to existing RAG systems.

<title>The World According to LLMs: How Geographic Origin Influences LLMs' Entity Deduction Capabilities</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively tuned to mitigate explicit biases, yet they often exhibit subtle implicit biases rooted in their pre-training data. Rather than directly probing LLMs with human-crafted questions that may trigger guardrails, we propose studying how models behave when they proactively ask questions themselves. The 20 Questions game, a multi-turn deduction task, serves as an ideal testbed for this purpose. We systematically evaluate geographic performance disparities in entity deduction using a new dataset, Geo20Q+, consisting of both notable people and culturally significant objects (e.g., foods, landmarks, animals) from diverse regions. We test popular LLMs across two gameplay configurations (canonical 20-question and unlimited turns) and in seven languages (English, Hindi, Mandarin, Japanese, French, Spanish, and Turkish). Our results reveal geographic disparities: LLMs are substantially more successful at deducing entities from the Global North than the Global South, and the Global West than the Global East. While Wikipedia pageviews and pre-training corpus frequency correlate mildly with performance, they fail to fully explain these disparities. Notably, the language in which the game is played has minimal impact on performance gaps. These findings demonstrate the value of creative, free-form evaluation frameworks for uncovering subtle biases in LLMs that remain hidden in standard prompting setups. By analyzing how models initiate and pursue reasoning goals over multiple turns, we find geographic and cultural disparities embedded in their reasoning processes. We release the dataset (Geo20Q+) and code at https://sites.google.com/view/llmbias20q/home.

Abstract: Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) are a class of generative models that allow exact and tractable inference for a wide range of queries. While recent developments have enabled the learning of deep and expressive PCs, this increased capacity can often lead to overfitting, especially when data is limited. We analyze PC overfitting from a log-likelihood-landscape perspective and show that it is often caused by convergence to sharp optima that generalize poorly. Inspired by sharpness aware minimization in neural networks, we propose a Hessian-based regularizer for training PCs. As a key contribution, we show that the trace of the Hessian of the log-likelihood-a sharpness proxy that is typically intractable in deep neural networks-can be computed efficiently for PCs. Minimizing this Hessian trace induces a gradient-norm-based regularizer that yields simple closed-form parameter updates for EM, and integrates seamlessly with gradient based learning methods. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently guides PCs toward flatter minima, improves generalization performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), but their inherent unreliability, such as hallucination and overconfidence, limits their application in high-risk domains. To address this, we propose a frequency-based uncertainty quantification method under black-box settings, leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to ensure provable coverage guarantees. Our approach involves multiple independent samplings of the model's output distribution for each input, with the most frequent sample serving as a reference to calculate predictive entropy (PE). Experimental evaluations across six LLMs and four datasets (MedMCQA, MedQA, MMLU, MMLU-Pro) demonstrate that frequency-based PE outperforms logit-based PE in distinguishing between correct and incorrect predictions, as measured by AUROC. Furthermore, the method effectively controls the empirical miscoverage rate under user-specified risk levels, validating that sampling frequency can serve as a viable substitute for logit-based probabilities in black-box scenarios. This work provides a distribution-free model-agnostic framework for reliable uncertainty quantification in MCQA with guaranteed coverage, enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs in practical applications.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, their performance often remains suboptimal when directly applied to specific downstream scenarios without task-specific adaptation. To enhance their utility while preserving data efficiency, recent research has increasingly focused on unsupervised adaptation methods that do not rely on labeled data. Despite the growing interest in this area, there remains a lack of a unified, task-oriented survey dedicated to unsupervised VLM adaptation. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive and structured overview of the field. We propose a taxonomy based on the availability and nature of unlabeled visual data, categorizing existing approaches into four key paradigms: Data-Free Transfer (no data), Unsupervised Domain Transfer (abundant data), Episodic Test-Time Adaptation (batch data), and Online Test-Time Adaptation (streaming data). Within this framework, we analyze core methodologies and adaptation strategies associated with each paradigm, aiming to establish a systematic understanding of the field. Additionally, we review representative benchmarks across diverse applications and highlight open challenges and promising directions for future research. An actively maintained repository of relevant literature is available at https://github.com/tim-learn/Awesome-LabelFree-VLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities for medical question answering and programming, but their potential for generating interpretable computable phenotypes (CPs) is under-explored. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can generate accurate and concise CPs for six clinical phenotypes of varying complexity, which could be leveraged to enable scalable clinical decision support to improve care for patients with hypertension. In addition to evaluating zero-short performance, we propose and test a synthesize, execute, debug, instruct strategy that uses LLMs to generate and iteratively refine CPs using data-driven feedback. Our results show that LLMs, coupled with iterative learning, can generate interpretable and reasonably accurate programs that approach the performance of state-of-the-art ML methods while requiring significantly fewer training examples.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective post-training paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language model (MLLM). However, current RL pipelines often suffer from training inefficiencies caused by two underexplored issues: Advantage Collapsing, where most advantages in a batch concentrate near zero, and Rollout Silencing, where the proportion of rollouts contributing non-zero gradients diminishes over time. These issues lead to suboptimal gradient updates and hinder long-term learning efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Shuffle-R1, a simple yet principled framework that improves RL fine-tuning efficiency by dynamically restructuring trajectory sampling and batch composition. It introduces (1) Pairwise Trajectory Sampling, which selects high-contrast trajectories with large advantages to improve gradient signal quality, and (2) Advantage-based Trajectory Shuffle, which increases exposure of valuable rollouts through informed batch reshuffling. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that our framework consistently outperforms strong RL baselines with minimal overhead. These results highlight the importance of data-centric adaptations for more efficient RL training in MLLM.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in reasoning tasks, where reinforcement learning (RL) serves as a key algorithm for enhancing their reasoning capabilities. Currently, there are two mainstream reward paradigms: model-based rewards and rule-based rewards. However, both approaches suffer from limitations: rule-based rewards lack robustness, while model-based rewards are vulnerable to reward hacking. To address these issues, we propose Cooper(Co-optimizing Policy Model and Reward Model), a RL framework that jointly optimizes both the policy model and the reward model. Cooper leverages the high precision of rule-based rewards when identifying correct responses, and dynamically constructs and selects positive-negative sample pairs for continued training the reward model. This design enhances robustness and mitigates the risk of reward hacking. To further support Cooper, we introduce a hybrid annotation strategy that efficiently and accurately generates training data for the reward model. We also propose a reference-based reward modeling paradigm, where the reward model takes a reference answer as input. Based on this design, we train a reward model named VerifyRM, which achieves higher accuracy on VerifyBench compared to other models of the same size. We conduct reinforcement learning using both VerifyRM and Cooper. Our experiments show that Cooper not only alleviates reward hacking but also improves end-to-end RL performance, for instance, achieving a 0.54% gain in average accuracy on Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct. Our findings demonstrate that dynamically updating reward model is an effective way to combat reward hacking, providing a reference for better integrating reward models into RL.

Abstract: Large language models excel at abstract reasoning but their capacity for embodied agent reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present OmniEAR, a comprehensive framework for evaluating how language models reason about physical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination in embodied tasks. Unlike existing benchmarks that provide predefined tool sets or explicit collaboration directives, OmniEAR requires agents to dynamically acquire capabilities and autonomously determine coordination strategies based on task demands. Through text-based environment representation, we model continuous physical properties and complex spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios spanning household and industrial domains. Our systematic evaluation reveals severe performance degradation when models must reason from constraints: while achieving 85-96% success with explicit instructions, performance drops to 56-85% for tool reasoning and 63-85% for implicit collaboration, with compound tasks showing over 50% failure rates. Surprisingly, complete environmental information degrades coordination performance, indicating models cannot filter task-relevant constraints. Fine-tuning improves single-agent tasks dramatically (0.6% to 76.3%) but yields minimal multi-agent gains (1.5% to 5.5%), exposing fundamental architectural limitations. These findings demonstrate that embodied reasoning poses fundamentally different challenges than current models can address, establishing OmniEAR as a rigorous benchmark for evaluating and advancing embodied AI systems. Our code and data are included in the supplementary materials and will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding, the task of mapping natural language instructions to precise screen coordinates, is fundamental to autonomous GUI agents. While existing methods achieve strong performance through extensive supervised training or reinforcement learning with labeled rewards, they remain constrained by the cost and availability of pixel-level annotations. We observe that when models generate multiple predictions for the same GUI element, the spatial overlap patterns reveal implicit confidence signals that can guide more accurate localization. Leveraging this insight, we propose GUI-RC (Region Consistency), a test-time scaling method that constructs spatial voting grids from multiple sampled predictions to identify consensus regions where models show highest agreement. Without any training, GUI-RC improves accuracy by 2-3% across various architectures on ScreenSpot benchmarks. We further introduce GUI-RCPO (Region Consistency Policy Optimization), which transforms these consistency patterns into rewards for test-time reinforcement learning. By computing how well each prediction aligns with the collective consensus, GUI-RCPO enables models to iteratively refine their outputs on unlabeled data during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generality of our approach: GUI-RC boosts Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct from 80.11% to 83.57% on ScreenSpot-v2, while GUI-RCPO further improves it to 85.14% through self-supervised optimization. Our approach reveals the untapped potential of test-time scaling and test-time reinforcement learning for GUI grounding, offering a promising path toward more robust and data-efficient GUI agents.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a critical task in modeling human behavior, especially in safety-critical domains such as social robotics and autonomous vehicle navigation. Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often lack accuracy and generalizability. Although deep learning approaches offer improved performance, they typically suffer from high computational cost, limited explainability, and, importantly, poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design trajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to generate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We propose two key innovations: Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to encourage population diversity, and a Statistics Feedback Loop that enables the LLM to analyze and improve alternative predictions. Our evaluations demonstrate that TrajEvo outperforms existing heuristic methods across multiple real-world datasets, and notably surpasses both heuristic and deep learning methods in generalizing to an unseen OOD real-world dataset. TrajEvo marks a promising step toward the automated design of fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory prediction heuristics. We release our source code to facilitate future research at https://github.com/ai4co/trajevo.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have started to demonstrate the ability to persuade humans, yet our understanding of how this dynamic transpires is limited. Recent work has used linear probes, lightweight tools for analyzing model representations, to study various LLM skills such as the ability to model user sentiment and political perspective. Motivated by this, we apply probes to study persuasion dynamics in natural, multi-turn conversations. We leverage insights from cognitive science to train probes on distinct aspects of persuasion: persuasion success, persuadee personality, and persuasion strategy. Despite their simplicity, we show that they capture various aspects of persuasion at both the sample and dataset levels. For instance, probes can identify the point in a conversation where the persuadee was persuaded or where persuasive success generally occurs across the entire dataset. We also show that in addition to being faster than expensive prompting-based approaches, probes can do just as well and even outperform prompting in some settings, such as when uncovering persuasion strategy. This suggests probes as a plausible avenue for studying other complex behaviours such as deception and manipulation, especially in multi-turn settings and large-scale dataset analysis where prompting-based methods would be computationally inefficient.

Abstract: Byte-level language models eliminate fragile tokenizers but face computational challenges in morphologically-rich languages (MRLs), where words span many bytes. We propose H-NET++, a hierarchical dynamic-chunking model that learns linguistically-informed segmentation through end-to-end training. Key innovations include: (1) a lightweight Transformer context-mixer (1.9M parameters) for cross-chunk attention, (2) a two-level latent hyper-prior for document-level consistency, (3) specialized handling of orthographic artifacts (e.g. Persian ZWNJ), and (4) curriculum-based training with staged sequence lengths. On a 1.4B-token Persian corpus, H-NET++ achieves state-of-the-art results: 0.159 BPB reduction versus BPE-based GPT-2-fa (12% better compression), 5.4pp gain on ParsGLUE, 53% improved robustness to ZWNJ corruption, and 73.8% F1 on gold morphological boundaries. Our learned chunks align with Persian morphology without explicit supervision, demonstrating that hierarchical dynamic chunking provides an effective tokenizer-free solution for MRLs while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Live streaming platforms have become a dominant form of online content consumption, offering dynamically evolving content, real-time interactions, and highly engaging user experiences. These unique characteristics introduce new challenges that differentiate live streaming recommendation from traditional recommendation settings and have garnered increasing attention from industry in recent years. However, research progress in academia has been hindered by the lack of publicly available datasets that accurately reflect the dynamic nature of live streaming environments. To address this gap, we introduce KuaiLive, the first real-time, interactive dataset collected from Kuaishou, a leading live streaming platform in China with over 400 million daily active users. The dataset records the interaction logs of 23,772 users and 452,621 streamers over a 21-day period. Compared to existing datasets, KuaiLive offers several advantages: it includes precise live room start and end timestamps, multiple types of real-time user interactions (click, comment, like, gift), and rich side information features for both users and streamers. These features enable more realistic simulation of dynamic candidate items and better modeling of user and streamer behaviors. We conduct a thorough analysis of KuaiLive from multiple perspectives and evaluate several representative recommendation methods on it, establishing a strong benchmark for future research. KuaiLive can support a wide range of tasks in the live streaming domain, such as top-K recommendation, click-through rate prediction, watch time prediction, and gift price prediction. Moreover, its fine-grained behavioral data also enables research on multi-behavior modeling, multi-task learning, and fairness-aware recommendation. The dataset and related resources are publicly available at https://imgkkk574.github.io/KuaiLive.

Abstract: Mobile robots navigating in crowds trained using reinforcement learning are known to suffer performance degradation when faced with out-of-distribution scenarios. We propose that by properly accounting for the uncertainties of pedestrians, a robot can learn safe navigation policies that are robust to distribution shifts. Our method augments agent observations with prediction uncertainty estimates generated by adaptive conformal inference, and it uses these estimates to guide the agent's behavior through constrained reinforcement learning. The system helps regulate the agent's actions and enables it to adapt to distribution shifts. In the in-distribution setting, our approach achieves a 96.93% success rate, which is over 8.80% higher than the previous state-of-the-art baselines with over 3.72 times fewer collisions and 2.43 times fewer intrusions into ground-truth human future trajectories. In three out-of-distribution scenarios, our method shows much stronger robustness when facing distribution shifts in velocity variations, policy changes, and transitions from individual to group dynamics. We deploy our method on a real robot, and experiments show that the robot makes safe and robust decisions when interacting with both sparse and dense crowds. Our code and videos are available on https://gen-safe-nav.github.io/.

Abstract: This paper introduces Bayesian frameworks for tackling various aspects of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems, leveraging a probabilistic interpretation of MCDM methods and challenges. By harnessing the flexibility of Bayesian models, the proposed frameworks offer statistically elegant solutions to key challenges in MCDM, such as group decision-making problems and criteria correlation. Additionally, these models can accommodate diverse forms of uncertainty in decision makers' (DMs) preferences, including normal and triangular distributions, as well as interval preferences. To address large-scale group MCDM scenarios, a probabilistic mixture model is developed, enabling the identification of homogeneous subgroups of DMs. Furthermore, a probabilistic ranking scheme is devised to assess the relative importance of criteria and alternatives based on DM(s) preferences. Through experimentation on various numerical examples, the proposed frameworks are validated, demonstrating their effectiveness and highlighting their distinguishing features in comparison to alternative methods.

Abstract: Perception occurs when individuals interpret the same information differently. It is a known cognitive phenomenon with implications for bias in human decision-making. Perception, however, remains understudied in machine learning (ML). This is problematic as modern decision flows, whether partially or fully automated by ML applications, always involve human experts. For instance, how might we account for cases in which two experts interpret differently the same deferred instance or explanation from a ML model? Addressing this and similar questions requires first a formulation of perception, particularly, in a manner that integrates with ML-enabled decision flows. In this work, we present a first approach to modeling perception causally. We define perception under causal reasoning using structural causal models (SCMs). Our approach formalizes individual experience as additional causal knowledge that comes with and is used by the expert decision-maker in the form of a SCM. We define two kinds of probabilistic causal perception: structural and parametrical. We showcase our framework through a series of examples of modern decision flows. We also emphasize the importance of addressing perception in fair ML, discussing relevant fairness implications and possible applications.

Abstract: In healthcare, multi-organ system diseases pose unique and significant challenges as they impact multiple physiological systems concurrently, demanding complex and coordinated treatment strategies. Despite recent advancements in the AI based clinical decision support systems, these solutions only focus on individual organ systems, failing to account for complex interdependencies between them. This narrow focus greatly hinders their effectiveness in recommending holistic and clinically actionable treatments in the real world setting. To address this critical gap, we propose a novel Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HMARL) framework. Our architecture deploys specialized and dedicated agents for each organ system and facilitates inter-agent communication to enable synergistic decision-making across organ systems. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-layer state representation technique that contextualizes patient conditions at both global and organ-specific levels, improving the accuracy and relevance of treatment decisions. We evaluate our HMARL solution on the task of sepsis management, a common and critical multi-organ disease, using both qualitative and quantitative metrics. Our method learns effective, clinically aligned treatment policies that considerably improve patient survival. We believe this framework represents a significant advancement in clinical decision support systems, introducing the first RL solution explicitly designed for multi-organ treatment recommendations. Our solution moves beyond prevailing simplified, single-organ models that fall short in addressing the complexity of multi-organ diseases.

<title>DOTS: Learning to Reason Dynamically in LLMs via Optimal Reasoning Trajectories Search</title>

Abstract: Enhancing the capability of large language models (LLMs) in reasoning has gained significant attention in recent years. Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of various prompting strategies in aiding LLMs in reasoning (called "reasoning actions"), such as step-by-step thinking, reflecting before answering, solving with programs, and their combinations. However, these approaches often applied static, predefined reasoning actions uniformly to all questions, without considering the specific characteristics of each question or the capability of the task-solving LLM. In this paper, we propose DOTS, an approach enabling LLMs to reason dynamically via optimal reasoning trajectory search, tailored to the specific characteristics of each question and the inherent capability of the task-solving LLM. Our approach involves three key steps: i) defining atomic reasoning action modules that can be composed into various reasoning action trajectories; ii) searching for the optimal action trajectory for each training question through iterative exploration and evaluation for the specific task-solving LLM; and iii) using the collected optimal trajectories to train an LLM to plan for the reasoning trajectories of unseen questions. In particular, we propose two learning paradigms, i.e., fine-tuning an external LLM as a planner to guide the task-solving LLM, or directly fine-tuning the task-solving LLM with an internalized capability for reasoning actions planning. Our experiments across eight reasoning tasks show that our method consistently outperforms static reasoning techniques and the vanilla instruction tuning approach. Further analysis reveals that our method enables LLMs to adjust their computation based on problem complexity, allocating deeper thinking and reasoning to harder problems.

Abstract: Autonomous web agents solve complex browsing tasks, yet existing benchmarks measure only whether an agent finishes a task, ignoring whether it does so safely or in a way enterprises can trust. To integrate these agents into critical workflows, safety and trustworthiness (ST) are prerequisite conditions for adoption. We introduce \textbf{\textsc{ST-WebAgentBench}}, a configurable and easily extensible suite for evaluating web agent ST across realistic enterprise scenarios. Each of its 222 tasks is paired with ST policies, concise rules that encode constraints, and is scored along six orthogonal dimensions (e.g., user consent, robustness). Beyond raw task success, we propose the \textit{Completion Under Policy} (\textit{CuP}) metric, which credits only completions that respect all applicable policies, and the \textit{Risk Ratio}, which quantifies ST breaches across dimensions. Evaluating three open state-of-the-art agents reveals that their average CuP is less than two-thirds of their nominal completion rate, exposing critical safety gaps. By releasing code, evaluation templates, and a policy-authoring interface, \href{https://sites.google.com/view/st-webagentbench/home}{\textsc{ST-WebAgentBench}} provides an actionable first step toward deploying trustworthy web agents at scale.

Abstract: Data harmonization is an essential task that entails integrating datasets from diverse sources. Despite years of research in this area, it remains a time-consuming and challenging task due to schema mismatches, varying terminologies, and differences in data collection methodologies. This paper presents the case for agentic data harmonization as a means to both empower experts to harmonize their data and to streamline the process. We introduce Harmonia, a system that combines LLM-based reasoning, an interactive user interface, and a library of data harmonization primitives to automate the synthesis of data harmonization pipelines. We demonstrate Harmonia in a clinical data harmonization scenario, where it helps to interactively create reusable pipelines that map datasets to a standard format. Finally, we discuss challenges and open problems, and suggest research directions for advancing our vision.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), their capability in understanding both images and text has greatly improved. However, their potential for leveraging multi-modal contextual information in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, this paper introduces Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (M$^2$RAG), a benchmark designed to evaluate the effectiveness of Multi-modal Large Language Models in leveraging knowledge from multi-modal retrieval documents. The benchmark comprises four tasks: image captioning, multi-modal question answering, multi-modal fact verification, and image reranking. All tasks are set in an open-domain setting, requiring RAG models to retrieve query-relevant information from a multi-modal document collection and use it as contextual input for RAG modeling. To enhance the context utilization capabilities of MLLMs, we also introduce Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Instruction Tuning (MM-RAIT), an instruction tuning method that optimizes MLLMs within multi-modal contexts. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MM-RAIT by significantly improving the quality of responses generated by different RAG models, outperforming MiniCPM-V 2.6 and Qwen2-VL with 34% and 33% gains, respectively. All data and code are available at https://github.com/NEUIR/M2RAG.

<title>Agent Guide: A Simple Agent Behavioral Watermarking Framework</title>

Abstract: The increasing deployment of intelligent agents in digital ecosystems, such as social media platforms, has raised significant concerns about traceability and accountability, particularly in cybersecurity and digital content protection. Traditional large language model (LLM) watermarking techniques, which rely on token-level manipulations, are ill-suited for agents due to the challenges of behavior tokenization and information loss during behavior-to-action translation. To address these issues, we propose Agent Guide, a novel behavioral watermarking framework that embeds watermarks by guiding the agent's high-level decisions (behavior) through probability biases, while preserving the naturalness of specific executions (action). Our approach decouples agent behavior into two levels, behavior (e.g., choosing to bookmark) and action (e.g., bookmarking with specific tags), and applies watermark-guided biases to the behavior probability distribution. We employ a z-statistic-based statistical analysis to detect the watermark, ensuring reliable extraction over multiple rounds. Experiments in a social media scenario with diverse agent profiles demonstrate that Agent Guide achieves effective watermark detection with a low false positive rate. Our framework provides a practical and robust solution for agent watermarking, with applications in identifying malicious agents and protecting proprietary agent systems.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel graph-based framework for robust and interpretable multiclass fault diagnosis in rotating machinery. The method integrates entropy-optimized signal segmentation, time-frequency feature extraction, and graph-theoretic modeling to transform vibration signals into structured representations suitable for classification. Graph metrics, such as average shortest path length, modularity, and spectral gap, are computed and combined with local features to capture global and segment-level fault characteristics. The proposed method achieves high diagnostic accuracy when evaluated on two benchmark datasets, the CWRU bearing dataset (under 0-3 HP loads) and the SU gearbox and bearing datasets (under different speed-load configurations). Classification scores reach up to 99.8% accuracy on Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and 100% accuracy on the Southeast University datasets using a logistic regression classifier. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong noise resilience, maintaining over 95.4% accuracy at high noise levels (standard deviation = 0.5), and demonstrates excellent cross-domain transferability with up to 99.7% F1-score in load-transfer scenarios. Compared to traditional techniques, this approach requires no deep learning architecture, enabling lower complexity while ensuring interpretability. The results confirm the method's scalability, reliability, and potential for real-time deployment in industrial diagnostics.

Abstract: We have seen remarkable progress in large language models (LLMs) empowered multi-agent systems solving complex tasks necessitating cooperation among experts with diverse skills. However, optimizing LLM-based multi-agent systems remains challenging. In this work, we perform an empirical case study on group optimization of role-based multi-agent systems utilizing natural language feedback for challenging software development tasks under various evaluation dimensions. We propose a two-step agent prompts optimization pipeline: identifying underperforming agents with their failure explanations utilizing textual feedback and then optimizing system prompts of identified agents utilizing failure explanations. We then study the impact of various optimization settings on system performance with two comparison groups: online against offline optimization and individual against group optimization. For group optimization, we study two prompting strategies: one-pass and multi-pass prompting optimizations. Overall, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our optimization method for role-based multi-agent systems tackling software development tasks evaluated on diverse evaluation dimensions, and we investigate the impact of diverse optimization settings on group behaviors of the multi-agent systems to provide practical insights for future development.

Abstract: Humans excel at analogical reasoning - applying knowledge from one task to a related one with minimal relearning. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) agents typically require extensive retraining even when new tasks share structural similarities with previously learned ones. In this work, we propose MAGIK, a novel framework that enables RL agents to transfer knowledge to analogous tasks without interacting with the target environment. Our approach leverages an imagination mechanism to map entities in the target task to their analogues in the source domain, allowing the agent to reuse its original policy. Experiments on custom MiniGrid and MuJoCo tasks show that MAGIK achieves effective zero-shot transfer using only a small number of human-labelled examples. We compare our approach to related baselines and highlight how it offers a novel and effective mechanism for knowledge transfer via imagination-based analogy mapping.

Abstract: The ongoing evolution of AI paradigms has propelled AI research into the agentic AI stage. Consequently, the focus of research has shifted from single agents and simple applications towards multi-agent autonomous decision-making and task collaboration in complex environments. As Large Language Models (LLMs) advance, their applications become more diverse and complex, leading to increasing situational and systemic risks. This has brought significant attention to value alignment for agentic AI systems, which aims to ensure that an agent's goals, preferences, and behaviors align with human values and societal norms. Addressing socio-governance demands through a Multi-level Value framework, this study comprehensively reviews value alignment in LLM-based multi-agent systems as the representative archetype of agentic AI systems. Our survey systematically examines three interconnected dimensions: First, value principles are structured via a top-down hierarchy across macro, meso, and micro levels. Second, application scenarios are categorized along a general-to-specific continuum explicitly mirroring these value tiers. Third, value alignment methods and evaluation are mapped to this tiered framework through systematic examination of benchmarking datasets and relevant methodologies. Additionally, we delve into value coordination among multiple agents within agentic AI systems. Finally, we propose several potential research directions in this field.

Abstract: Proficient game agents with diverse play styles enrich the gaming experience and enhance the replay value of games. However, recent advancements in game AI based on reinforcement learning have predominantly focused on improving proficiency, whereas methods based on evolution algorithms generate agents with diverse play styles but exhibit subpar performance compared to RL methods. To address this gap, this paper proposes Mixed Proximal Policy Optimization (MPPO), a method designed to improve the proficiency of existing suboptimal agents while retaining their distinct styles. MPPO unifies loss objectives for both online and offline samples and introduces an implicit constraint to approximate demonstrator policies by adjusting the empirical distribution of samples. Empirical results across environments of varying scales demonstrate that MPPO achieves proficiency levels comparable to, or even superior to, pure online algorithms while preserving demonstrators' play styles. This work presents an effective approach for generating highly proficient and diverse game agents, ultimately contributing to more engaging gameplay experiences.

Abstract: Benchmarks are essential for quantitatively tracking progress in AI. As AI agents become increasingly capable, researchers and practitioners have introduced agentic benchmarks to evaluate agents on complex, real-world tasks. These benchmarks typically measure agent capabilities by evaluating task outcomes via specific reward designs. However, we show that many agentic benchmarks have issues in task setup or reward design. For example, SWE-bench Verified uses insufficient test cases, while TAU-bench counts empty responses as successful. Such issues can lead to under- or overestimation of agents' performance by up to 100% in relative terms. To make agentic evaluation rigorous, we introduce the Agentic Benchmark Checklist (ABC), a set of guidelines that we synthesized from our benchmark-building experience, a survey of best practices, and previously reported issues. When applied to CVE-Bench, a benchmark with a particularly complex evaluation design, ABC reduces the performance overestimation by 33%.

Abstract: Recently, inspired by OpenAI-o1/o3 and Deepseek-R1, the R1-Style method based on reinforcement learning fine-tuning has received widespread attention from the community. Previous R1-Style methods mainly focus on mathematical reasoning and code intelligence. It is of great research significance to verify their advantages on more general multimodal data. Chart is an important multimodal data type with rich information, which brings important research challenges in complex reasoning. In this work, we introduce Chart-R1, a chart-domain vision-language model with reinforcement learning fine-tuning to enable complex chart reasoning. To support Chart-R1, we first propose a novel programmatic data synthesis technology to generate high-quality step-by-step chart reasoning data covering single- and multi-subcharts, which makes up for the lack of reasoning data in the chart domain. Then we develop a two-stage training strategy: Chart-COT with step-by-step chain-of-thought supervision, and Chart-RFT with numerically sensitive reinforcement fine-tuning. Chart-COT aims to decompose complex chart reasoning tasks into fine-grained, understandable subtasks through step-by-step supervision, which lays a good foundation for improving the reasoning level of reinforcement learning. Chart-RFT utilize the typical group relative policy optimization strategy, in which a relatively soft reward is adopted for numerical response to emphasize the numerical sensitivity in the chart domain. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source benchmarks and self-built chart reasoning dataset (\emph{i.e., ChartRQA}). Experimental results show that Chart-R1 has significant advantages compared to chart-domain methods, even comparable to open/closed source large-scale models (\emph{e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-3.5}).

Abstract: Large reasoning models achieve remarkable performance through extensive chain-of-thought generation, yet they suffer from a critical inefficiency: applying uniformly extensive reasoning regardless of problem complexity. We present Hierarchical Budget Policy Optimization (HBPO), a reinforcement learning framework that enables models to learn problem-specific reasoning depths without sacrificing capability. Unlike existing approaches that impose rigid constraints or rely on discrete mode selection, HBPO partitions the exploration space into budget-constrained hierarchies (512-2560 tokens), each with differentiated reward structures that preserve both efficiency incentives and reasoning capabilities. This design addresses a fundamental challenge in efficient reasoning training: traditional length penalties systematically bias models away from necessary long reasoning paths, causing exploration space collapse. Through hierarchical sampling and budget-aware rewards, HBPO maintains exploration diversity while teaching models to recognize when extended deliberation is warranted. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HBPO reduces average token usage by up to 60.6% while improving accuracy by 3.14% across four reasoning benchmarks. Most notably, HBPO exhibits emergent adaptive behavior where models automatically adjust reasoning depth based on problem complexity. Our results suggest that reasoning efficiency and capability are not inherently conflicting, and can be simultaneously optimized through appropriately structured hierarchical training that preserves exploration diversity.

Abstract: We introduce SafeWork-R1, a cutting-edge multimodal reasoning model that demonstrates the coevolution of capabilities and safety. It is developed by our proposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive, safety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of multi-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that simply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop intrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety `aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of $46.54\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks without compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety performance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude Opus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct inference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism, enforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop SafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and SafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B. All resulting models demonstrate that safety and capability can co-evolve synergistically, highlighting the generalizability of our framework in building robust, reliable, and trustworthy general-purpose AI.

Abstract: Pain is a multifaceted phenomenon that affects a substantial portion of the population. Reliable and consistent evaluation benefits those experiencing pain and underpins the development of effective and advanced management strategies. Automatic pain-assessment systems deliver continuous monitoring, inform clinical decision-making, and aim to reduce distress while preventing functional decline. By incorporating physiological signals, these systems provide objective, accurate insights into an individual's condition. This study has been submitted to the \textit{Second Multimodal Sensing Grand Challenge for Next-Gen Pain Assessment (AI4PAIN)}. The proposed method introduces a pipeline that leverages electrodermal activity signals as input modality. Multiple representations of the signal are created and visualized as waveforms, and they are jointly visualized within a single multi-representation diagram. Extensive experiments incorporating various processing and filtering techniques, along with multiple representation combinations, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. It consistently yields comparable, and in several cases superior, results to traditional fusion methods, establishing it as a robust alternative for integrating different signal representations or modalities.

Abstract: Pain is a complex condition affecting a large portion of the population. Accurate and consistent evaluation is essential for individuals experiencing pain, and it supports the development of effective and advanced management strategies. Automatic pain assessment systems provide continuous monitoring and support clinical decision-making, aiming to reduce distress and prevent functional decline. This study has been submitted to the \textit{Second Multimodal Sensing Grand Challenge for Next-Gen Pain Assessment (AI4PAIN)}. The proposed method introduces a pipeline that leverages respiration as the input signal and incorporates a highly efficient cross-attention transformer alongside a multi-windowing strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that respiration is a valuable physiological modality for pain assessment. Moreover, experiments revealed that compact and efficient models, when properly optimized, can achieve strong performance, often surpassing larger counterparts. The proposed multi-window approach effectively captures both short-term and long-term features, as well as global characteristics, thereby enhancing the model's representational capacity.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted data science workflows, giving rise to specialized data science agents designed to automate analytical tasks. Despite rapid adoption, systematic benchmarks evaluating the efficacy and limitations of these agents remain scarce. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark specifically crafted to reflect real-world user interactions with data science agents by observing usage of our commercial applications. We evaluate three LLMs: Claude-4.0-Sonnet, Gemini-2.5-Flash, and OpenAI-o4-Mini across three approaches: zero-shot with context engineering, multi-step with context engineering, and with SmolAgent. Our benchmark assesses performance across a diverse set of eight data science task categories, additionally exploring the sensitivity of models to common prompting issues, such as data leakage and slightly ambiguous instructions. We further investigate the influence of temperature parameters on overall and task-specific outcomes for each model and approach. Our findings reveal distinct performance disparities among the evaluated models and methodologies, highlighting critical factors that affect practical deployment. The benchmark dataset and evaluation framework introduced herein aim to provide a foundation for future research of more robust and effective data science agents.

<title>Unsupervised Graph Deep Learning Reveals Emergent Flood Risk Profile of Urban Areas</title>

Abstract: Urban flood risk emerges from complex and nonlinear interactions among multiple features related to flood hazard, flood exposure, and social and physical vulnerabilities, along with the complex spatial flood dependence relationships. Existing approaches for characterizing urban flood risk, however, are primarily based on flood plain maps, focusing on a limited number of features, primarily hazard and exposure features, without consideration of feature interactions or the dependence relationships among spatial areas. To address this gap, this study presents an integrated urban flood-risk rating model based on a novel unsupervised graph deep learning model (called FloodRisk-Net). FloodRisk-Net is capable of capturing spatial dependence among areas and complex and nonlinear interactions among flood hazards and urban features for specifying emergent flood risk. Using data from multiple metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the United States, the model characterizes their flood risk into six distinct city-specific levels. The model is interpretable and enables feature analysis of areas within each flood-risk level, allowing for the identification of the three archetypes shaping the highest flood risk within each MSA. Flood risk is found to be spatially distributed in a hierarchical structure within each MSA, where the core city disproportionately bears the highest flood risk. Multiple cities are found to have high overall flood-risk levels and low spatial inequality, indicating limited options for balancing urban development and flood-risk reduction. Relevant flood-risk reduction strategies are discussed considering ways that the highest flood risk and uneven spatial distribution of flood risk are formed.

<title>Probabilities of Chat LLMs Are Miscalibrated but Still Predict Correctness on Multiple-Choice Q&amp;A</title>

Abstract: We study 15 large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned for chat and find that their maximum softmax probabilities (MSPs) are consistently miscalibrated on multiple-choice Q&amp;A. However, those MSPs might still encode useful uncertainty information. Specifically, we hypothesized that wrong answers would be associated with smaller MSPs compared to correct answers. Via rigorous statistical testing, we show that this hypothesis holds for models which perform well on the underlying Q&amp;A task. We also find a strong direction correlation between Q&amp;A accuracy and MSP correctness prediction, while finding no correlation between Q&amp;A accuracy and calibration error. This suggests that within the current fine-tuning paradigm, we can expect correctness prediction but not calibration to improve as LLM capabilities progress. To demonstrate the utility of correctness prediction, we show that when models have the option to abstain, performance can be improved by selectively abstaining based on the MSP of the initial model response, using only a small amount of labeled data to choose the MSP threshold.

Abstract: Multi-modality magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) data facilitate the early diagnosis, tumor segmentation, and disease staging in the management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The lack of publicly available, comprehensive datasets limits advancements in diagnosis, treatment planning, and the development of machine learning algorithms for NPC. Addressing this critical need, we introduce the first comprehensive NPC MRI dataset, encompassing MR axial imaging of 277 primary NPC patients. This dataset includes T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences, totaling 831 scans. In addition to the corresponding clinical data, manually annotated and labeled segmentations by experienced radiologists offer high-quality data resources from untreated primary NPC.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for ensuring their safe and reliable use. However, existing explainable AI (XAI) methods for LLMs primarily rely on word-level explanations, which are often computationally inefficient and misaligned with human reasoning processes. Moreover, these methods often treat explanation as a one-time output, overlooking its inherently interactive and iterative nature. In this paper, we present LLM Analyzer, an interactive visualization system that addresses these limitations by enabling intuitive and efficient exploration of LLM behaviors through counterfactual analysis. Our system features a novel algorithm that generates fluent and semantically meaningful counterfactuals via targeted removal and replacement operations at user-defined levels of granularity. These counterfactuals are used to compute feature attribution scores, which are then integrated with concrete examples in a table-based visualization, supporting dynamic analysis of model behavior. A user study with LLM practitioners and interviews with experts demonstrate the system's usability and effectiveness, emphasizing the importance of involving humans in the explanation process as active participants rather than passive recipients.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for 3D mesh reconstruction from multi-view images. Our method takes inspiration from large reconstruction models like LRM that use a transformer-based triplane generator and a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) model trained on multi-view images. However, in our method, we introduce several important modifications that allow us to significantly enhance 3D reconstruction quality. First of all, we examine the original LRM architecture and find several shortcomings. Subsequently, we introduce respective modifications to the LRM architecture, which lead to improved multi-view image representation and more computationally efficient training. Second, in order to improve geometry reconstruction and enable supervision at full image resolution, we extract meshes from the NeRF field in a differentiable manner and fine-tune the NeRF model through mesh rendering. These modifications allow us to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both 2D and 3D evaluation metrics, such as a PSNR of 28.67 on Google Scanned Objects (GSO) dataset. Despite these superior results, our feed-forward model still struggles to reconstruct complex textures, such as text and portraits on assets. To address this, we introduce a lightweight per-instance texture refinement procedure. This procedure fine-tunes the triplane representation and the NeRF color estimation model on the mesh surface using the input multi-view images in just 4 seconds. This refinement improves the PSNR to 29.79 and achieves faithful reconstruction of complex textures, such as text. Additionally, our approach enables various downstream applications, including text- or image-to-3D generation.

<title>CrisisSense-LLM: Instruction Fine-Tuned Large Language Model for Multi-label Social Media Text Classification in Disaster Informatics</title>

Abstract: In the field of crisis/disaster informatics, social media is increasingly being used for improving situational awareness to inform response and relief efforts. Efficient and accurate text classification tools have been a focal area of investigation in crisis informatics. However, current methods mostly rely on single-label text classification models, which fails to capture different insights embedded in dynamic and multifaceted disaster-related social media data. This study introduces a novel approach to disaster text classification by enhancing a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) through instruction fine-tuning targeted for multi-label classification of disaster-related tweets. Our methodology involves creating a comprehensive instruction dataset from disaster-related tweets, which is then used to fine-tune an open-source LLM, thereby embedding it with disaster-specific knowledge. This fine-tuned model can classify multiple aspects of disaster-related information simultaneously, such as the type of event, informativeness, and involvement of human aid, significantly improving the utility of social media data for situational awareness in disasters. The results demonstrate that this approach enhances the categorization of critical information from social media posts, thereby facilitating a more effective deployment for situational awareness during emergencies. This research paves the way for more advanced, adaptable, and robust disaster management tools, leveraging the capabilities of LLMs to improve real-time situational awareness and response strategies in disaster scenarios.

Abstract: Over the past few decades, electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring has become a pivotal tool for diagnosing neurological disorders, particularly for detecting seizures. Epilepsy, one of the most prevalent neurological diseases worldwide, affects approximately the 1 \% of the population. These patients face significant risks, underscoring the need for reliable, continuous seizure monitoring in daily life. Most of the techniques discussed in the literature rely on supervised Machine Learning (ML) methods. However, the challenge of accurately labeling variations in epileptic EEG waveforms complicates the use of these approaches. Additionally, the rarity of ictal events introduces an high imbalancing within the data, which could lead to poor prediction performance in supervised learning approaches. Instead, a semi-supervised approach allows to train the model only on data not containing seizures, thus avoiding the issues related to the data imbalancing. This work proposes a semi-supervised approach for detecting epileptic seizures from EEG data, utilizing a novel Deep Learning-based method called SincVAE. This proposal incorporates the learning of an ad-hoc array of bandpass filter as a first layer of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), potentially eliminating the preprocessing stage where informative band frequencies are identified and isolated. Results indicate that SincVAE improves seizure detection in EEG data and is capable of identifying early seizures during the preictal stage as well as monitoring patients throughout the postictal stage.

Abstract: Multimodal semantic segmentation shows significant potential for enhancing segmentation accuracy in complex scenes. However, current methods often incorporate specialized feature fusion modules tailored to specific modalities, thereby restricting input flexibility and increasing the number of training parameters. To address these challenges, we propose StitchFusion, a straightforward yet effective modal fusion framework that integrates large-scale pre-trained models directly as encoders and feature fusers. This approach facilitates comprehensive multi-modal and multi-scale feature fusion, accommodating any visual modal inputs. Specifically, Our framework achieves modal integration during encoding by sharing multi-modal visual information. To enhance information exchange across modalities, we introduce a multi-directional adapter module (MultiAdapter) to enable cross-modal information transfer during encoding. By leveraging MultiAdapter to propagate multi-scale information across pre-trained encoders during the encoding process, StitchFusion achieves multi-modal visual information integration during encoding. Extensive comparative experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on four multi-modal segmentation datasets with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, the experimental integration of MultiAdapter with existing Feature Fusion Modules (FFMs) highlights their complementary nature. Our code is available at StitchFusion_repo.

Abstract: Building high-quality datasets for specialized tasks is a time-consuming and resource-intensive process that often requires specialized domain knowledge. We propose Corpus Retrieval and Augmentation for Fine-Tuning (CRAFT), a method for generating synthetic datasets, given a small number of user-written few-shots that demonstrate the task to be performed. Given these examples, CRAFT uses large-scale public web-crawled corpora and similarity-based document retrieval to find other relevant human-written documents. Lastly, instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) augment the retrieved documents into custom-formatted task samples, which then can be used for fine-tuning. We demonstrate that CRAFT can efficiently generate large-scale task-specific training datasets for four diverse tasks: biology, medicine, and commonsense question-answering (QA), as well as summarization. Our experiments show that CRAFT-based models outperform or match general LLMs on QA tasks, while exceeding models trained on human-curated summarization data by 46 preference points. CRAFT outperforms other synthetic dataset generation methods such as Self- and Evol-Instruct, and remains robust even when the quality of the initial few-shots varies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing tasks, yet their internal knowledge structures remain poorly understood. This study examines these structures through the lens of historical Olympic medal tallies, evaluating LLMs on two tasks: (1) retrieving medal counts for specific teams and (2) identifying rankings of each team. While state-of-the-art LLMs excel in recalling medal counts, they struggle with providing rankings, highlighting a key difference between their knowledge organization and human reasoning. These findings shed light on the limitations of LLMs' internal knowledge integration and suggest directions for improvement. To facilitate further research, we release our code, dataset, and model outputs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are starting to complement traditional information seeking mechanisms such as web search. LLM-powered chatbots like ChatGPT are gaining prominence among the general public. AI chatbots are also increasingly producing content on social media platforms. However, LLMs are also prone to hallucinations, generating plausible yet factually incorrect or fabricated information. This becomes a critical problem when laypeople start seeking information about sensitive issues such as healthcare. Existing works in LLM hallucinations in the medical domain mainly focus on testing the medical knowledge of LLMs through standardized medical exam questions which are often well-defined and clear-cut with definitive answers. However, these approaches may not fully capture how these LLMs perform during real-world interactions with patients. This work conducts a pioneering study on hallucinations in LLM-generated responses to real-world healthcare queries from patients.We introduce MedHalu, a novel medical hallucination benchmark featuring diverse health-related topics and hallucinated responses from LLMs, with detailed annotation of the hallucination types and text spans. We also propose MedHaluDetect, a comprehensive framework for evaluating LLMs' abilities to detect hallucinations. Furthermore, we study the vulnerability to medical hallucinations among three groups -- medical experts, LLMs, and laypeople. Notably, LLMs significantly underperform human experts and, in some cases, even laypeople in detecting medical hallucinations. To improve hallucination detection, we propose an expert-in-the-loop approach that integrates expert reasoning into LLM inputs, significantly improving hallucination detection for all LLMs, including a 6.3% macro-F1 improvement for GPT-4.

arXiv:2410.01215v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While large language models have made significant strides in code generation, the pass rate of the generated code is bottlenecked on subtle errors, often requiring human intervention to pass tests, especially for complex problems. Existing LLM-based debugging systems treat generated programs as monolithic units, failing to address bugs at multiple levels of granularity, from low-level syntax errors to high-level algorithmic flaws. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Granularity Debugger (MGDebugger), a hierarchical code debugger by isolating, identifying, and resolving bugs at various levels of granularity. MGDebugger decomposes problematic code into a hierarchical tree structure of subfunctions, with each level representing a particular granularity of error. During debugging, it analyzes each subfunction and iteratively resolves bugs in a bottom-up manner. To effectively test each subfunction, we propose an LLM-simulated Python executor, which traces code execution and tracks important variable states to pinpoint errors accurately. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGDebugger outperforms existing debugging systems, achieving an 18.9% improvement in accuracy over seed generations in HumanEval and a 97.6% repair success rate in HumanEvalFix. Furthermore, MGDebugger effectively fixes bugs across different categories and difficulty levels, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.

Abstract: Human motion is inherently continuous and dynamic, posing significant challenges for generative models. While discrete generation methods are widely used, they suffer from limited expressiveness and frame-wise noise artifacts. In contrast, continuous approaches produce smoother, more natural motion but often struggle to adhere to conditioning signals due to high-dimensional complexity and limited training data. To resolve this 'discord' between discrete and continuous representations we introduce DisCoRD: Discrete Tokens to Continuous Motion via Rectified Flow Decoding, a novel method that leverages rectified flow to decode discrete motion tokens in the continuous, raw motion space. Our core idea is to frame token decoding as a conditional generation task, ensuring that DisCoRD captures fine-grained dynamics and achieves smoother, more natural motions. Compatible with any discrete-based framework, our method enhances naturalness without compromising faithfulness to the conditioning signals on diverse settings. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that DisCoRD achieves state-of-the-art performance, with FID of 0.032 on HumanML3D and 0.169 on KIT-ML. These results establish DisCoRD as a robust solution for bridging the divide between discrete efficiency and continuous realism. Project website: https://whwjdqls.github.io/discord-motion/

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals serve as a powerful tool in affective Brain-Computer Interfaces (aBCIs) and play a crucial role in affective computing. In recent years, the introduction of deep learning techniques has significantly advanced the development of aBCIs. However, the current emotion recognition methods based on deep transfer learning face the challenge of the dual dependence of the model on source domain and target domain, As well as being affected by label noise, which seriously affects the performance and generalization ability of the model. To overcome this limitation, we proposes a Pairwise Learning framework with Domain and Category Prototypes for EEG emotion recognition under unseen target conditions (PL-DCP), and integrating concepts of feature disentanglement and prototype inference. Here, the feature disentanglement module extracts and decouples the emotional EEG features to form domain features and class features, and further calculates the dual prototype representation. The Domain-pprototype captures the individual variations across subjects, while the class-prototype captures the cross-individual commonality of emotion categories. In addition, the pairwise learning strategy effectively reduces the noise effect caused by wrong labels. The PL-DCP framework conducts a systematic experimental evaluation on the published datasets SEED, SEED-IV and SEED-V, and the accuracy are 82.88\%, 65.15\% and 61.29\%, respectively. The results show that compared with other State-of-the-Art(SOTA) Methods, the PL-DCP model still achieves slightly better performance than the deep transfer learning method that requires both source and target data, although the target domain is completely unseen during the training. This work provides an effective and robust potential solution for emotion recognition. The source code is available at https://github.com/WuCB-BCI/PL_DCP.

Abstract: We present TokenFlow, a novel unified image tokenizer that bridges the long-standing gap between multimodal understanding and generation. Prior research attempt to employ a single reconstruction-targeted Vector Quantization (VQ) encoder for unifying these two tasks. We observe that understanding and generation require fundamentally different granularities of visual information. This leads to a critical trade-off, particularly compromising performance in multimodal understanding tasks. TokenFlow addresses this challenge through an innovative dual-codebook architecture that decouples semantic and pixel-level feature learning while maintaining their alignment via a shared mapping mechanism. This design enables direct access to both high-level semantic representations crucial for understanding tasks and fine-grained visual features essential for generation through shared indices. Our extensive experiments demonstrate TokenFlow's superiority across multiple dimensions. Leveraging TokenFlow, we demonstrate for the first time that discrete visual input can surpass LLaVA-1.5 13B in understanding performance, achieving a 7.2\% average improvement. For image reconstruction, we achieve a strong FID score of 0.63 at 384*384 resolution. Moreover, TokenFlow establishes state-of-the-art performance in autoregressive image generation with a GenEval score of 0.55 at 256*256 resolution, achieving comparable results to SDXL.

Abstract: Anomaly detection on text-rich graphs is widely prevalent in real life, such as detecting incorrectly assigned academic papers to authors and detecting bots in social networks. The remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs) pave a new revenue by utilizing rich-text information for effective anomaly detection. However, simply introducing rich texts into LLMs can obscure essential detection cues and introduce high fine-tuning costs. Moreover, LLMs often overlook the intrinsic structural bias of graphs which is vital for distinguishing normal from abnormal node patterns. To this end, this paper introduces GuARD, a text-rich and graph-informed language model that combines key structural features from graph-based methods with fine-grained semantic attributes extracted via small language models for effective anomaly detection on text-rich graphs. GuARD is optimized with the progressive multi-modal multi-turn instruction tuning framework in the task-guided instruction tuning regime tailed to incorporate both rich-text and structural modalities. Extensive experiments on four datasets reveal that GuARD outperforms graph-based and LLM-based anomaly detection methods, while offering up to 5$\times$ times speedup in training and 5$\times$ times speedup in inference over vanilla long-context LLMs on the large-scale WhoIsWho dataset.

Abstract: Anomaly synthesis is a crucial approach to augment abnormal data for advancing anomaly inspection. Based on the knowledge from the large-scale pre-training, existing text-to-image anomaly synthesis methods predominantly focus on textual information or coarse-aligned visual features to guide the entire generation process. However, these methods often lack sufficient descriptors to capture the complicated characteristics of realistic anomalies (e.g., the fine-grained visual pattern of anomalies), limiting the realism and generalization of the generation process. To this end, we propose a novel anomaly synthesis framework called AnomalyControl to learn cross-modal semantic features as guidance signals, which could encode the generalized anomaly cues from text-image reference prompts and improve the realism of synthesized abnormal samples. Specifically, AnomalyControl adopts a flexible and non-matching prompt pair (i.e., a text-image reference prompt and a targeted text prompt), where a Cross-modal Semantic Modeling (CSM) module is designed to extract cross-modal semantic features from the textual and visual descriptors. Then, an Anomaly-Semantic Enhanced Attention (ASEA) mechanism is formulated to allow CSM to focus on the specific visual patterns of the anomaly, thus enhancing the realism and contextual relevance of the generated anomaly features. Treating cross-modal semantic features as the prior, a Semantic Guided Adapter (SGA) is designed to encode effective guidance signals for the adequate and controllable synthesis process. Extensive experiments indicate that AnomalyControl can achieve state-of-the-art results in anomaly synthesis compared with existing methods while exhibiting superior performance for downstream tasks.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used for knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA). Despite the encouraging results of previous studies, prior methods prompt LLMs to predict answers directly, neglecting intermediate thought processes. We argue that prior methods do not sufficiently activate the capacities of LLMs. We propose a framework called PLRH that Prompts LLMs with Rationale Heuristics for knowledge-based VQA. The PLRH prompts LLMs with Chain of Thought (CoT) to generate rationale heuristics, i.e., intermediate thought processes, and then leverages the rationale heuristics to inspire LLMs to predict answers. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the existing baselines by more than 2.2 and 2.1 on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, respectively.

<title>PromptDresser: Improving the Quality and Controllability of Virtual Try-On via Generative Textual Prompt and Prompt-aware Mask</title>

Abstract: Recent virtual try-on approaches have advanced by finetuning pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to leverage their powerful generative ability. However, the use of text prompts in virtual try-on remains underexplored. This paper tackles a text-editable virtual try-on task that modifies the clothing based on the provided clothing image while editing the wearing style (e.g., tucking style, fit) according to the text descriptions. In the text-editable virtual try-on, three key aspects exist: (i) designing rich text descriptions for paired person-clothing data to train the model, (ii) addressing the conflicts where textual information of the existing person's clothing interferes the generation of the new clothing, and (iii) adaptively adjust the inpainting mask aligned with the text descriptions, ensuring proper editing areas while preserving the original person's appearance irrelevant to the new clothing. To address these aspects, we propose PromptDresser, a text-editable virtual try-on model that leverages large multimodal model (LMM) assistance to enable high-quality and versatile manipulation based on generative text prompts. Our approach utilizes LMMs via in-context learning to generate detailed text descriptions for person and clothing images independently, including pose details and editing attributes using minimal human cost. Moreover, to ensure the editing areas, we adjust the inpainting mask depending on the text prompts adaptively. Our approach enhances text editability while effectively conveying clothing details that are difficult to capture through images alone, leading to improved image quality. Experiments show that PromptDresser significantly outperforms baselines, demonstrating superior text-driven control and versatile clothing manipulation. Our code is available at https://github.com/rlawjdghek/PromptDresser.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA). However existing methods still have challenges: the inability to use external tools autonomously, and the inability to work in teams. Humans tend to know whether they need to use external tools when they encounter a new question, e.g., they tend to be able to give a direct answer to a familiar question, whereas they tend to use tools such as search engines when they encounter an unfamiliar question. In addition, humans also tend to collaborate and discuss with others to get better answers. Inspired by this, we propose the multi-agent voting framework. We design three LLM-based agents that simulate different levels of staff in a team, and assign the available tools according to the levels. Each agent provides the corresponding answer, and finally all the answers provided by the agents are voted to get the final answer. Experiments on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA show that our approach outperforms other baselines by 2.2 and 1.0, respectively.

<title>Can open source large language models be used for tumor documentation in Germany? -- An evaluation on urological doctors' notes</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12106</link>

arXiv:2501.12106v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tumor documentation in Germany is largely done manually, requiring reading patient records and entering data into structured databases. Large language models (LLMs) could potentially enhance this process by improving efficiency and reliability. This evaluation tests eleven different open source LLMs with sizes ranging from 1-70 billion model parameters on three basic tasks of the tumor documentation process: identifying tumor diagnoses, assigning ICD-10 codes, and extracting the date of first diagnosis. For evaluating the LLMs on these tasks, a dataset of annotated text snippets based on anonymized doctors' notes from urology was prepared. Different prompting strategies were used to investigate the effect of the number of examples in few-shot prompting and to explore the capabilities of the LLMs in general. The models Llama 3.1 8B, Mistral 7B, and Mistral NeMo 12 B performed comparably well in the tasks. Models with less extensive training data or having fewer than 7 billion parameters showed notably lower performance, while larger models did not display performance gains. Examples from a different medical domain than urology could also improve the outcome in few-shot prompting, which demonstrates the ability of LLMs to handle tasks needed for tumor documentation. Open source LLMs show a strong potential for automating tumor documentation. Models from 7-12 billion parameters could offer an optimal balance between performance and resource efficiency. With tailored fine-tuning and well-designed prompting, these models might become important tools for clinical documentation in the future. The code for the evaluation is available from https://github.com/stefan-m-lenz/UroLlmEval. We also release the dataset as a new valuable resource that addresses the shortage of authentic and easily accessible benchmarks in German-language medical NLP.

<title>MetaOcc: Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Surround-View 4D Radar and Camera for 3D Occupancy Prediction with Dual Training Strategies</title>

Abstract: Robust 3D occupancy prediction is essential for autonomous driving, particularly under adverse weather conditions where traditional vision-only systems struggle. While the fusion of surround-view 4D radar and cameras offers a promising low-cost solution, effectively extracting and integrating features from these heterogeneous sensors remains challenging. This paper introduces MetaOcc, a novel multi-modal framework for omnidirectional 3D occupancy prediction that leverages both multi-view 4D radar and images. To address the limitations of directly applying LiDAR-oriented encoders to sparse radar data, we propose a Radar Height Self-Attention module that enhances vertical spatial reasoning and feature extraction. Additionally, a Hierarchical Multi-scale Multi-modal Fusion strategy is developed to perform adaptive local-global fusion across modalities and time, mitigating spatio-temporal misalignments and enriching fused feature representations. To reduce reliance on expensive point cloud annotations, we further propose a pseudo-label generation pipeline based on an open-set segmentor. This enables a semi-supervised strategy that achieves 90% of the fully supervised performance using only 50% of the ground truth labels, offering an effective trade-off between annotation cost and accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaOcc under full supervision achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous methods by +0.47 SC IoU and +4.02 mIoU on the OmniHD-Scenes dataset, and by +1.16 SC IoU and +1.24 mIoU on the SurroundOcc-nuScenes dataset. These results demonstrate the scalability and robustness of MetaOcc across sensor domains and training conditions, paving the way for practical deployment in real-world autonomous systems. Code and data are available at https://github.com/LucasYang567/MetaOcc.

Abstract: We introduce EMSYNC, a video-based symbolic music generation model that aligns music with a video's emotional content and temporal boundaries. It follows a two-stage framework, where a pretrained video emotion classifier extracts emotional features, and a conditional music generator produces MIDI sequences guided by both emotional and temporal cues. We introduce boundary offsets, a novel temporal conditioning mechanism that enables the model to anticipate and align musical chords with scene cuts. Unlike existing models, our approach retains event-based encoding, ensuring fine-grained timing control and expressive musical nuances. We also propose a mapping scheme to bridge the video emotion classifier, which produces discrete emotion categories, with the emotion-conditioned MIDI generator, which operates on continuous-valued valence-arousal inputs. In subjective listening tests, EMSYNC outperforms state-of-the-art models across all subjective metrics, for music theory-aware participants as well as the general listeners.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2502.13417v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to align with user preferences is challenging due to the high cost of quality human annotations in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and the generalizability limitations of AI Feedback. To address these challenges, we propose RLTHF, a human-AI hybrid framework that combines LLM-based initial alignment with selective human annotations to achieve full-human annotation alignment with minimal effort. RLTHF identifies hard-to-annotate samples mislabeled by LLMs using a reward model's reward distribution and iteratively enhances alignment by integrating strategic human corrections while leveraging LLM's correctly labeled samples. Evaluations on HH-RLHF and TL;DR datasets show that RLTHF reaches full-human annotation-level alignment with only 6-7% of the human annotation effort. Furthermore, models trained on RLTHF's curated datasets for downstream tasks outperform those trained on fully human-annotated datasets, underscoring the effectiveness of RLTHF.

Abstract: Professional 3D asset creation often requires diverse sculpting brushes to add surface details and geometric structures. Despite recent progress in 3D generation, producing reusable sculpting brushes compatible with artists' workflows remains an open and challenging problem. These sculpting brushes are typically represented as vector displacement maps (VDMs), which existing models cannot easily generate compared to natural images. This paper presents Text2VDM, a novel framework for text-to-VDM brush generation through the deformation of a dense planar mesh guided by score distillation sampling (SDS). The original SDS loss is designed for generating full objects and struggles with generating desirable sub-object structures from scratch in brush generation. We refer to this issue as semantic coupling, which we address by introducing weighted blending of prompt tokens to SDS, resulting in a more accurate target distribution and semantic guidance. Experiments demonstrate that Text2VDM can generate diverse, high-quality VDM brushes for sculpting surface details and geometric structures. Our generated brushes can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream modeling software, enabling various applications such as mesh stylization and real-time interactive modeling.

<title>Semantic Integrity Constraints: Declarative Guardrails for AI-Augmented Data Processing Systems</title>

Abstract: AI-augmented data processing systems (DPSs) integrate large language models (LLMs) into query pipelines, allowing powerful semantic operations on structured and unstructured data. However, the reliability (a.k.a. trust) of these systems is fundamentally challenged by the potential for LLMs to produce errors, limiting their adoption in critical domains. To help address this reliability bottleneck, we introduce semantic integrity constraints (SICs) -- a declarative abstraction for specifying and enforcing correctness conditions over LLM outputs in semantic queries. SICs generalize traditional database integrity constraints to semantic settings, supporting common types of constraints, such as grounding, soundness, and exclusion, with both reactive and proactive enforcement strategies.
  We argue that SICs provide a foundation for building reliable and auditable AI-augmented data systems. Specifically, we present a system design for integrating SICs into query planning and runtime execution and discuss its realization in AI-augmented DPSs. To guide and evaluate our vision, we outline several design goals -- covering criteria around expressiveness, runtime semantics, integration, performance, and enterprise-scale applicability -- and discuss how our framework addresses each, along with open research challenges.

<title>GNN-Enhanced Fault Diagnosis Method for Parallel Cyber-physical Attacks in Power Grids</title>

arXiv:2503.05797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parallel cyber-physical attacks (PCPA) simultaneously damage physical transmission lines and block measurement data transmission in power grids, impairing or delaying system protection and recovery. This paper investigates the fault diagnosis problem for a linearized (DC) power flow model under PCPA. The physical attack mechanism includes not only line disconnection but also admittance modification, for example via compromised distributed flexible AC transmission system (D-FACTS) devices. To address this problem, we propose a fault diagnosis framework based on meta-mixed-integer programming (MMIP), integrating graph attention network-based fault localization (GAT-FL). First, we derive measurement reconstruction conditions that allow reconstructing unknown measurements in attacked areas from available measurements and the system topology. Based on these conditions, we formulate the diagnosis task as an MMIP model. The GAT-FL predicts a probability distribution over potential physical attacks, which is then incorporated as objective coefficients in the MMIP. Solving the MMIP yields optimal attack location and magnitude estimates, from which the system states are also reconstructed. Experimental simulations are conducted on IEEE 30/118 bus standard test cases to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fault diagnosis algorithms.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of vision-language models (VLMs) in autonomous driving systems is of paramount importance, yet existing research has largely focused on conventional benchmarks rather than safety-critical evaluation. In this work, we present SCD-Bench (Safety Cognition Driving Benchmark) a novel framework specifically designed to assess the safety cognition capabilities of VLMs within interactive driving scenarios. To address the scalability challenge of data annotation, we introduce ADA (Autonomous Driving Annotation), a semi-automated labeling system, further refined through expert review by professionals with domain-specific knowledge in autonomous driving. To facilitate scalable and consistent evaluation, we also propose an automated assessment pipeline leveraging large language models, which demonstrates over 98% agreement with human expert judgments. In addressing the broader challenge of aligning VLMs with safety cognition in driving environments, we construct SCD-Training, the first large-scale dataset tailored for this task, comprising 324.35K high-quality samples. Through extensive experiments, we show that models trained on SCD-Training exhibit marked improvements not only on SCD-Bench, but also on general and domain-specific benchmarks, offering a new perspective on enhancing safety-aware interactions in vision-language systems for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Prompting Large Language Models (LLMs), or providing context on the expected model of operation, is an effective way to steer the outputs of such models to satisfy human desiderata after they have been trained. But in rapidly evolving domains, there is often need to fine-tune LLMs to improve either the kind of knowledge in their memory or their abilities to perform open ended reasoning in new domains. When human's learn new concepts, we often do so by linking the new material that we are studying to concepts we have already learned before. To that end, we ask, "can prompting help us teach LLMs how to learn". In this work, we study a novel generalization of instruction tuning, called contextual fine-tuning, to fine-tune LLMs. Our method leverages instructional prompts designed to mimic human cognitive strategies in learning and problem-solving to guide the learning process during training, aiming to improve the model's interpretation and understanding of domain-specific knowledge. We empirically demonstrate that this simple yet effective modification improves the ability of LLMs to be fine-tuned rapidly on new datasets both within the medical and financial domains.

Abstract: 3D point cloud has been widely used in applications such as self-driving cars, robotics, CAD models, etc. To the best of our knowledge, these applications raised the issue of privacy leakage in 3D point clouds, which has not been studied well. Different from the 2D image privacy, which is related to texture and 2D geometric structure, the 3D point cloud is texture-less and only relevant to 3D geometric structure. In this work, we defined the 3D point cloud privacy problem and proposed an efficient privacy-preserving framework named PointFlowGMM that can support downstream classification and segmentation tasks without seeing the original data. Using a flow-based generative model, the point cloud is projected into a latent Gaussian mixture distributed subspace. We further designed a novel angular similarity loss to obfuscate the original geometric structure and reduce the model size from 767MB to 120MB without a decrease in recognition performance. The projected point cloud in the latent space is orthogonally rotated randomly to further protect the original geometric structure, the class-to-class relationship is preserved after rotation, thus, the protected point cloud can support the recognition task. We evaluated our model on multiple datasets and achieved comparable recognition results on encrypted point clouds compared to the original point clouds.

Abstract: This study evaluates large language models (LLMs) in generating code from algorithm descriptions in recent NLP papers. The task requires two key competencies: (1) algorithm comprehension: synthesizing information from papers and academic literature to understand implementation logic, and (2) coding expertise: identifying dependencies and correctly implementing necessary APIs. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce SciReplicate-Bench, a benchmark of 100 tasks from 36 NLP papers published in 2024, featuring detailed annotations and comprehensive test cases. Building on SciReplicate-Bench, we propose Sci-Reproducer, a dual-agent framework consisting of a Paper Agent that interprets algorithmic concepts from literature and a Code Agent that retrieves dependencies from repositories and implements solutions. To assess algorithm understanding, we introduce reasoning graph accuracy, which quantifies similarity between generated and reference reasoning graphs derived from code comments and structure. For evaluating implementation quality, we employ execution accuracy, CodeBLEU, and repository dependency/API recall metrics. In our experiments, we evaluate various powerful non-reasoning and reasoning LLMs as foundational models. The best-performing LLM using \ModelName~achieves only 39% execution accuracy, highlighting the benchmark's difficulty. Our analysis identifies missing or inconsistent algorithm descriptions as key barriers to successful reproduction. We make available our benchmark and code at https://github.com/xyzCS/SciReplicate-Bench and project homepage at https://xyzcs.github.io/scireplicate.github.io/.

arXiv:2504.04699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in software vulnerability detection, yet their reasoning capabilities remain unreliable. We propose R2Vul, a method that combines reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF) and structured reasoning distillation to teach small code LLMs to detect vulnerabilities while generating security-aware explanations. Unlike prior chain-of-thought and instruction tuning approaches, R2Vul rewards well-founded over deceptively plausible vulnerability explanations through RLAIF, which results in more precise detection and high-quality reasoning generation. To support RLAIF, we construct the first multilingual preference dataset for vulnerability detection, comprising 18,000 high-quality samples in C\#, JavaScript, Java, Python, and C. We evaluate R2Vul across five programming languages and against four static analysis tools, eight state-of-the-art LLM-based baselines, and various fine-tuning approaches. Our results demonstrate that a 1.5B R2Vul model exceeds the performance of its 32B teacher model and leading commercial LLMs such as Claude-4-Opus. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight calibration step that reduces false positive rates under varying imbalanced data distributions. Finally, through qualitative analysis, we show that both LLM and human evaluators consistently rank R2Vul model's reasoning higher than other reasoning-based baselines.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the lifespan of critical device components is essential for maintenance planning and production optimization, making it a topic of significant interest in both academia and industry. In this work, we investigate the use of survival analysis for predicting the lifespan of production printheads developed by Canon Production Printing. Specifically, we focus on the application of five techniques to estimate survival probabilities and failure rates: the Kaplan-Meier estimator, Cox proportional hazard model, Weibull accelerated failure time model, random survival forest, and gradient boosting. The resulting estimates are further refined using isotonic regression and subsequently aggregated to determine the expected number of failures. The predictions are then validated against real-world ground truth data across multiple time windows to assess model reliability. Our quantitative evaluation using three performance metrics demonstrates that survival analysis outperforms industry-standard baseline methods for printhead lifespan prediction.

Abstract: Quality-Diversity algorithms have transformed optimization by prioritizing the discovery of diverse, high-performing solutions over a single optimal result. However, traditional Quality-Diversity methods, such as MAP-Elites, rely heavily on predefined behavior descriptors and complete prior knowledge of the task to define the behavior space grid, limiting their flexibility and applicability. In this work, we introduce Vector Quantized-Elites (VQ-Elites), a novel Quality-Diversity algorithm that autonomously constructs a structured behavior space grid using unsupervised learning, eliminating the need for prior task-specific knowledge. At the core of VQ-Elites is the integration of Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders, which enables the dynamic learning of behavior descriptors and the generation of a structured, rather than unstructured, behavior space grid -- a significant advancement over existing unsupervised Quality-Diversity approaches. This design establishes VQ-Elites as a flexible, robust, and task-agnostic optimization framework. To further enhance the performance of unsupervised Quality-Diversity algorithms, we introduce behavior space bounding and cooperation mechanisms, which significantly improve convergence and performance, as well as the Effective Diversity Ratio and Coverage Diversity Score, two novel metrics that quantify the actual diversity in the unsupervised setting. We validate VQ-Elites on robotic arm pose-reaching, mobile robot space-covering, and MiniGrid exploration tasks. The results demonstrate its ability to efficiently generate diverse, high-quality solutions, emphasizing its adaptability, scalability, robustness to hyperparameters, and potential to extend Quality-Diversity optimization to complex, previously inaccessible domains.

Abstract: One of the key safety considerations of battery manufacturing is thermal runaway, the uncontrolled increase in temperature which can lead to fires, explosions, and emissions of toxic gasses. As such, development of automated systems capable of detecting such events is of considerable importance in both academic and industrial contexts. In this work, we investigate the use of deep learning for detecting thermal runaway in the battery production line of VDL Nedcar, a Dutch automobile manufacturer. Specifically, we collect data from the production line to represent both baseline (non thermal runaway) and thermal runaway conditions. Thermal runaway was simulated through the use of external heat and smoke sources. The data consisted of both optical and thermal images which were then preprocessed and fused before serving as input to our models. In this regard, we evaluated three deep-learning models widely used in computer vision including shallow convolutional neural networks, residual neural networks, and vision transformers on two performance metrics. Furthermore, we evaluated these models using explainability methods to gain insight into their ability to capture the relevant feature information from their inputs. The obtained results indicate that the use of deep learning is a viable approach to thermal runaway detection in battery production lines.

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs)aim to engage users in dialogue to provide tailored recommendations. While traditional CRSs focus on eliciting preferences and retrieving items, real-world e-commerce interactions involve more complex decision-making, where users consider multiple factors beyond simple attributes. To capture this complexity, we introduce Conversational Sales (CSALES), a novel task that integrates preference elicitation, recommendation, and persuasion within a unified conversational framework. To support realistic and systematic evaluation, we present CSUSER, an evaluation protocol with LLM-based user simulator grounded in real-world behavioral data by modeling fine-grained user profiles for personalized interaction. We also propose CSI, a conversational sales agent that proactively infers contextual user profiles and strategically selects actions through conversation. Comprehensive experiments show that CSI significantly improves both recommendation success and persuasive effectiveness across diverse user profiles.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in reasoning and question answering, yet their tendency to generate factually incorrect content remains a critical challenge. This study evaluates proprietary and open-source LLMs on generating relevant research papers with accurate arXiv links. Our evaluation reveals critical academic risks: LLMs frequently generate incorrect arXiv links or references to non-existent papers, fundamentally undermining their ability to properly attribute research contributions to the actual authors. We introduce arXivBench, a benchmark specifically designed to assess LLM performance across eight major subject categories on arXiv and five subfields within computer science, one of the most popular categories among them. Our findings show concerning accuracy variations across subjects, with Claude-3.5-Sonnet exhibiting a substantial advantage in generating both relevant and accurate responses. Notably, most LLMs perform significantly better in Artificial Intelligence than other subfields. This benchmark provides a standardized tool for evaluating LLM reliability in scientific contexts, promoting more dependable academic use in research environments. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/liningresearch/arXivBench and https://huggingface.co/datasets/arXivBenchLLM/arXivBench.

<title>JEPA4Rec: Learning Effective Language Representations for Sequential Recommendation via Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture</title>

Abstract: Language representation learning has emerged as a promising approach for sequential recommendation, thanks to its ability to learn generalizable representations. However, despite its advantages, this approach still struggles with data sparsity and a limited understanding of common-sense user preferences. To address these limitations, we propose $\textbf{JEPA4Rec}$, a framework that combines $\textbf{J}$oint $\textbf{E}$mbedding $\textbf{P}$redictive $\textbf{A}$rchitecture with language modeling of item textual descriptions. JEPA4Rec captures semantically rich and transferable representations, improving recommendation performance and reducing reliance on large-scale pre-training data. Specifically, JEPA4Rec represents items as text sentences by flattening descriptive information such as $\textit{title, category}$, and other attributes. To encode these sentences, we employ a bidirectional Transformer encoder with modified embedding layers tailored for capturing item information in recommendation datasets. We apply masking to text sentences and use them to predict the representations of the unmasked sentences, helping the model learn generalizable item embeddings. To further improve recommendation performance and language understanding, we employ a two-stage training strategy incorporating self-supervised learning losses. Experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that JEPA4Rec consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in cross-domain, cross-platform, and low-resource scenarios.

<title>Probabilistic Stability Guarantees for Feature Attributions</title>

Abstract: Stability guarantees have emerged as a principled way to evaluate feature attributions, but existing certification methods rely on heavily smoothed classifiers and often produce conservative guarantees. To address these limitations, we introduce soft stability and propose a simple, model-agnostic, sample-efficient stability certification algorithm (SCA) that yields non-trivial and interpretable guarantees for any attribution method. Moreover, we show that mild smoothing achieves a more favorable trade-off between accuracy and stability, avoiding the aggressive compromises made in prior certification methods. To explain this behavior, we use Boolean function analysis to derive a novel characterization of stability under smoothing. We evaluate SCA on vision and language tasks and demonstrate the effectiveness of soft stability in measuring the robustness of explanation methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in explainable recommendation have greatly bolstered user experience by elucidating the decision-making rationale. However, the existing methods actually fail to provide effective feedback signals for potentially better or worse generated explanations due to their reliance on traditional supervised learning paradigms in sparse interaction data. To address these issues, we propose a novel human-like feedback-driven optimization framework. This framework employs a dynamic interactive optimization mechanism for achieving human-centered explainable requirements without incurring high labor costs. Specifically, we propose to utilize large language models (LLMs) as human simulators to predict human-like feedback for guiding the learning process. To enable the LLMs to deeply understand the task essence and meet user's diverse personalized requirements, we introduce a human-induced customized reward scoring method, which helps stimulate the language understanding and logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Furthermore, considering the potential conflicts between different perspectives of explanation quality, we introduce a principled Pareto optimization that transforms the multi-perspective quality enhancement task into a multi-objective optimization problem for improving explanation performance. At last, to achieve efficient model training, we design an off-policy optimization pipeline. By incorporating a replay buffer and addressing the data distribution biases, we can effectively improve data utilization and enhance model generality. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

<title>Diffusion Models are Secretly Exchangeable: Parallelizing DDPMs via Autospeculation</title>

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have emerged as powerful tools for generative modeling. However, their sequential computation requirements lead to significant inference-time bottlenecks. In this work, we utilize the connection between DDPMs and Stochastic Localization to prove that, under an appropriate reparametrization, the increments of DDPM satisfy an exchangeability property. This general insight enables near-black-box adaptation of various performance optimization techniques from autoregressive models to the diffusion setting. To demonstrate this, we introduce \emph{Autospeculative Decoding} (ASD), an extension of the widely used speculative decoding algorithm to DDPMs that does not require any auxiliary draft models. Our theoretical analysis shows that ASD achieves a $\tilde{O} (K^{\frac{1}{3}})$ parallel runtime speedup over the $K$ step sequential DDPM. We also demonstrate that a practical implementation of autospeculative decoding accelerates DDPM inference significantly in various domains.

Abstract: Large language models can generate solutions to complex problems, but training them with reinforcement learning typically requires verifiable rewards that are expensive to create and not possible for all domains. We demonstrate that LLMs can effectively self-improve through self-judging without reference solutions, leveraging the inherent asymmetry between generating and verifying solutions. Our experiments show that models can provide reliable reward signals without ground truth answers, enabling reinforcement learning in domains where verifiable rewards are impractical. By implementing self-judging across Countdown puzzles and integration problems, we achieve performance comparable to formal verification without ground truth solutions. Most notably, Qwen 2.5 7B DeepSeek Distilled trained with self-rewards qualifies for the prestigious MIT Integration Bee competition, performance through self-supervised improvement. When combined with synthetic question generation, we establish a complete self-improvement loop where models generate practice problems, solve them, and evaluate their own performance without any external validation. Our findings demonstrate that LLM judges can provide effective reward signals for training, unlocking reinforcement learning in countless domains previously limited by reward engineering challenges. This work represents a significant step toward autonomous AI systems that continuously improve through self-directed learning rather than human-guided training, potentially accelerating progress across domains where training data is scarce or evaluation is complex.

Abstract: Remote sensing image (RSI) interpretation typically faces challenges due to the scarcity of labeled data, which limits the performance of RSI interpretation tasks. To tackle this challenge, we propose EarthSynth, a diffusion-based generative foundation model that enables synthesizing multi-category, cross-satellite labeled Earth observation for downstream RSI interpretation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, EarthSynth is the first to explore multi-task generation for remote sensing, tackling the challenge of limited generalization in task-oriented synthesis for RSI interpretation. EarthSynth, trained on the EarthSynth-180K dataset, employs the Counterfactual Composition training strategy with a three-dimensional batch-sample selection mechanism to improve training data diversity and enhance category control. Furthermore, a rule-based method of R-Filter is proposed to filter more informative synthetic data for downstream tasks. We evaluate our EarthSynth on scene classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation in open-world scenarios. There are significant improvements in open-vocabulary understanding tasks, offering a practical solution for advancing RSI interpretation.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across tasks, yet they often exhibit difficulty in distinguishing task-relevant from irrelevant signals, particularly in tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA), which can lead to susceptibility to misleading or spurious inputs. We refer to this broader limitation as the Cross-Modality Competency Problem: the model's inability to fairly evaluate all modalities. This vulnerability becomes more evident in modality-specific tasks such as image classification or pure text question answering, where models are expected to rely solely on one modality. In such tasks, spurious information from irrelevant modalities often leads to significant performance degradation. We refer to this failure as Modality Interference, which serves as a concrete and measurable instance of the cross-modality competency problem. We further design a perturbation-based causal diagnostic experiment to verify and quantify this problem. To mitigate modality interference, we propose a novel framework to fine-tune MLLMs, including perturbation-based data augmentations with both heuristic perturbations and adversarial perturbations via Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), and a consistency regularization strategy applied to model outputs with original and perturbed inputs. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets (image-heavy, text-heavy, and VQA tasks) and multiple model families with different scales demonstrate significant improvements in robustness and cross-modality competency, indicating our method's effectiveness in boosting unimodal reasoning ability while enhancing performance on multimodal tasks.

Abstract: In this work, we present WeatherEdit, a novel weather editing pipeline for generating realistic weather effects with controllable types and severity in 3D scenes. Our approach is structured into two key components: weather background editing and weather particle construction. For weather background editing, we introduce an all-in-one adapter that integrates multiple weather styles into a single pretrained diffusion model, enabling the generation of diverse weather effects in 2D image backgrounds. During inference, we design a Temporal-View (TV-) attention mechanism that follows a specific order to aggregate temporal and spatial information, ensuring consistent editing across multi-frame and multi-view images. To construct the weather particles, we first reconstruct a 3D scene using the edited images and then introduce a dynamic 4D Gaussian field to generate snowflakes, raindrops and fog in the scene. The attributes and dynamics of these particles are precisely controlled through physical-based modelling and simulation, ensuring realistic weather representation and flexible severity adjustments. Finally, we integrate the 4D Gaussian field with the 3D scene to render consistent and highly realistic weather effects. Experiments on multiple driving datasets demonstrate that WeatherEdit can generate diverse weather effects with controllable condition severity, highlighting its potential for autonomous driving simulation in adverse weather.

<title>Learning to Diagnose Privately: DP-Powered LLMs for Radiology Report Classification</title>

arXiv:2506.04450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: This study proposes a framework for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with differential privacy (DP) to perform multi-abnormality classification on radiology report text. By injecting calibrated noise during fine-tuning, the framework seeks to mitigate the privacy risks associated with sensitive patient data and protect against data leakage while maintaining classification performance. Materials and Methods: We used 50,232 radiology reports from the publicly available MIMIC-CXR chest radiography and CT-RATE computed tomography datasets, collected between 2011 and 2019. Fine-tuning of LLMs was conducted to classify 14 labels from MIMIC-CXR dataset, and 18 labels from CT-RATE dataset using Differentially Private Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA) in high and moderate privacy regimes (across a range of privacy budgets = {0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0}). Model performance was evaluated using weighted F1 score across three model architectures: BERT-medium, BERT-small, and ALBERT-base. Statistical analyses compared model performance across different privacy levels to quantify the privacy-utility trade-off. Results: We observe a clear privacy-utility trade-off through our experiments on 2 different datasets and 3 different models. Under moderate privacy guarantees the DP fine-tuned models achieved comparable weighted F1 scores of 0.88 on MIMIC-CXR and 0.59 on CT-RATE, compared to non-private LoRA baselines of 0.90 and 0.78, respectively. Conclusion: Differentially private fine-tuning using LoRA enables effective and privacy-preserving multi-abnormality classification from radiology reports, addressing a key challenge in fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive medical data.

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based text-to-motion generation have led to impressive progress in synthesizing high-quality human motion. Nevertheless, jointly achieving high fidelity, streaming capability, real-time responsiveness, and scalability remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper, we propose MOGO (Motion Generation with One-pass), a novel autoregressive framework tailored for efficient and real-time 3D motion generation. MOGO comprises two key components: (1) MoSA-VQ, a motion scale-adaptive residual vector quantization module that hierarchically discretizes motion sequences with learnable scaling to produce compact yet expressive representations; and (2) RQHC-Transformer, a residual quantized hierarchical causal transformer that generates multi-layer motion tokens in a single forward pass, significantly reducing inference latency. To enhance semantic fidelity, we further introduce a text condition alignment mechanism that improves motion decoding under textual control. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including HumanML3D, KIT-ML, and CMP demonstrate that MOGO achieves competitive or superior generation quality compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based methods, while offering substantial improvements in real-time performance, streaming generation, and generalization under zero-shot settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significant impact on the healthcare scenarios but remain prohibitively large for deployment in real-time, resource-constrained environments such as edge devices. In this work, we introduce a novel medical assistant system, optimized through our general-purpose compression framework, which tailors Large Language Models (LLMs) for deployment in specialized domains. By measuring neuron saliency on domain-specific data, our method can aggressively prune irrelevant neurons, reducing model size while preserving performance. Following pruning, we apply post-training quantization to further reduce the memory footprint, and evaluate the compressed model across medical benchmarks including MedMCQA, MedQA, and PubMedQA. We also deploy the 50\% compressed Gemma and the 67\% compressed LLaMA3 models on Jetson Orin Nano (18.7W peak) and Raspberry Pi 5 (6.3W peak), achieving real-time, energy-efficient inference under hardware constraints.

Abstract: Proton arc therapy (PAT) is an emerging and promising modality in radiotherapy, offering improved dose distribution and treatment robustness over intensity-modulated proton therapy. Yet, identifying the optimal energy layer (EL) sequence remains challenging due to the intensive computational demand and prolonged treatment delivery time. This study proposes an unsupervised deep learning model for fast EL pre-selection that minimizes EL switch (ELS) time while maintaining high plan quality. We introduce a novel data representation method, spot-count representation, which encodes the number of proton spots intersecting the target and organs at risk (OAR) in a matrix structured by sorted gantry angles and energy layers. This representation serves as the input of an U-Net style architecture, SPArc_dl, which is trained using a tri-objective function: maximizing spot-counts on target, minimizing spot-counts on OAR, and reducing ELS time. The model is evaluated on 35 nasopharyngeal cancer cases, and its performance is compared to SPArc_particle_swarm (SPArc_ps). SPArc_dl produces EL pre-selection that significantly improves both plan quality and delivery efficiency. Compared to SPArc_ps, it enhances the conformity index by 0.1 (p<0.01), reduces the homogeneity index by 0.71 (p<0.01), lowers the brainstem mean dose by 0.25 (p<0.01), and shortens the ELS time by 37.2% (p < 0.01). The results unintentionally reveal employing unchanged ELS is more time-wise efficient than descended ELS. SPArc_dl's inference time is within 1 second. However, SPArc_dl plan demonstrates limitation in robustness. The proposed spot-count representation lays a foundation for incorporating unsupervised deep learning approaches into EL pre-selection task. SPArc_dl is a fast tool for generating high-quality PAT plans by strategically pre-selecting EL to reduce delivery time while maintaining excellent dosimetric performance.

Abstract: Model-driven engineering problems often require complex model transformations (MTs), i.e., MTs that are chained in extensive sequences. Pertinent examples of such problems include model synchronization, automated model repair, and design space exploration. Manually developing complex MTs is an error-prone and often infeasible process. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an apt way to alleviate these issues. In RL, an autonomous agent explores the state space through trial and error to identify beneficial sequences of actions, such as MTs. However, RL methods exhibit performance issues in complex problems. In these situations, human guidance can be of high utility. In this paper, we present an approach and technical framework for developing complex MT sequences through RL, guided by potentially uncertain human advice. Our framework allows user-defined MTs to be mapped onto RL primitives, and executes them as RL programs to find optimal MT sequences. Our evaluation shows that human guidance, even if uncertain, substantially improves RL performance, and results in more efficient development of complex MTs. Through a trade-off between the certainty and timeliness of human advice, our method takes a step towards RL-driven human-in-the-loop engineering methods.

Abstract: Nonverbal communication (NVC) plays an integral role in human language, but studying NVC in general is challenging because of its broad scope and high variance in interpretation among individuals and cultures. However, mime -- the theatrical technique of suggesting intent using only gesture, expression, and movement -- is a subset of NVC that consists of explicit and embodied actions with much lower human interpretation variance. We argue that a solid understanding of mimed actions is a crucial prerequisite for vision-language models capable of interpreting and commanding more subtle aspects of NVC. Hence, we propose Mime Identification Multimodal Evaluation (MIME), a novel video-based question answering benchmark comprising of 86 mimed actions. Constructed with motion capture data, MIME consists of variations of each action with perturbations applied to the character, background, and viewpoint for evaluating recognition robustness. We find that both open-weight and API-based vision-language models perform significantly worse than humans on MIME, motivating the need for increased research for instilling more robust understanding of human gestures.

Abstract: Smart contract vulnerabilities have led to billions in losses, yet finding actionable exploits remains challenging. Traditional fuzzers rely on rigid heuristics and struggle with complex attacks, while human auditors are thorough but slow and don't scale. Large Language Models offer a promising middle ground, combining human-like reasoning with machine speed.
  However, early studies show that simply prompting LLMs generates unverified vulnerability speculations with high false positive rates. To address this, we present A1, an agentic system that transforms any LLM into an end-to-end exploit generator. A1 provides agents with six domain-specific tools for autonomous vulnerability discovery, from understanding contract behavior to testing strategies on real blockchain states. All outputs are concretely validated through execution, ensuring only profitable proof-of-concept exploits are reported. We evaluate A1 across 36 real-world vulnerable contracts on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. A1 achieves a 63% success rate on the VERITE benchmark. Across all successful cases, A1 extracts up to \$8.59 million per exploit and \$9.33 million total. Through 432 experiments across six LLMs, we show that most exploits emerge within five iterations, with costs ranging \$0.01-\$3.59 per attempt.
  Using Monte Carlo analysis of historical attacks, we demonstrate that immediate vulnerability detection yields 86-89% success probability, dropping to 6-21% with week-long delays. Our economic analysis reveals a troubling asymmetry: attackers achieve profitability at \$6,000 exploit values while defenders require \$60,000 -- raising fundamental questions about whether AI agents inevitably favor exploitation over defense.

Abstract: High-quality labeled datasets are crucial for training and evaluating foundation models in software engineering, but creating them is often prohibitively expensive and labor-intensive. We introduce SPICE, a scalable, automated pipeline for labeling SWE-bench-style datasets with annotations for issue clarity, test coverage, and effort estimation. SPICE combines context-aware code navigation, rationale-driven prompting, and multi-pass consensus to produce labels that closely approximate expert annotations. SPICE's design was informed by our own experience and frustration in labeling more than 800 instances from SWE-Gym. SPICE achieves strong agreement with human-labeled SWE-bench Verified data while reducing the cost of labeling 1,000 instances from around $100,000 (manual annotation) to just $5.10. These results demonstrate SPICE's potential to enable cost-effective, large-scale dataset creation for SE-focused FMs. To support the community, we release both SPICE tool and SPICE Bench, a new dataset of 6,802 SPICE-labeled instances curated from 291 open-source projects in SWE-Gym (over 13x larger than SWE-bench Verified).

However, selecting an optimal blend of task datasets remains a largely manual, heuristic driven process, with practitioners often relying on uniform or size based sampling strategies. We introduce TASKPGM, a principled and scalable framework for mixture optimization that selects continuous task proportions by minimizing an energy function over a Markov Random Field (MRF). Task relationships are modeled using behavioral divergences such as Jensen Shannon Divergence and Pointwise Mutual Information computed from the predictive distributions of single task finetuned models. Our method yields a closed form solution under simplex constraints and provably balances representativeness and diversity among tasks. We provide theoretical guarantees, including weak submodularity for budgeted variants, and demonstrate consistent empirical improvements on Llama 2 and Mistral across evaluation suites such as MMLU and BIGBench. Beyond performance, TASKPGM offers interpretable insights into task influence and mixture composition, making it a powerful tool for efficient and robust LLM finetuning.

Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of interest in Multi-Target Cross-Domain Recommendation (MTCDR), which aims to enhance recommendation performance across multiple domains simultaneously. Existing MTCDR methods primarily rely on domain-shared entities (\eg users or items) to fuse and transfer cross-domain knowledge, which may be unavailable in non-overlapped recommendation scenarios. Some studies model user preferences and item features as domain-sharable semantic representations, which can be utilized to tackle the MTCDR task. Nevertheless, they often require extensive auxiliary data for pre-training. Developing more effective solutions for MTCDR remains an important area for further exploration.
  Inspired by recent advancements in generative recommendation, this paper introduces GMC, a generative paradigm-based approach for multi-target cross-domain recommendation. The core idea of GMC is to leverage semantically quantized discrete item identifiers as a medium for integrating multi-domain knowledge within a unified generative model. GMC first employs an item tokenizer to generate domain-shared semantic identifiers for each item, and then formulates item recommendation as a next-token generation task by training a domain-unified sequence-to-sequence model. To further leverage the domain information to enhance performance, we incorporate a domain-aware contrastive loss into the semantic identifier learning, and perform domain-specific fine-tuning on the unified recommender. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GMC compared to a range of baseline methods.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have long dominated the landscape of large language models, driving progress across a wide range of tasks. Recently, diffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative, though their advantages over AR models remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically study masked diffusion models in data-constrained settings-where training involves repeated passes over limited data-and find that they significantly outperform AR models when compute is abundant but data is scarce. Diffusion models make better use of repeated data, achieving lower validation loss and superior downstream performance. We interpret this advantage as implicit data augmentation: masked diffusion exposes the model to a diverse distribution of token orderings and prediction tasks, unlike AR's fixed left-to-right factorization. We find new scaling laws for diffusion models and derive a closed-form expression for the critical compute threshold at which diffusion begins to outperform AR. These results suggest that when data, not compute, is the bottleneck, diffusion models offer a compelling alternative to the standard AR paradigm.

<title>Look Before You Fuse: 2D-Guided Cross-Modal Alignment for Robust 3D Detection</title>

Abstract: Integrating LiDAR and camera inputs into a unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) representation is crucial for enhancing 3D perception capabilities of autonomous vehicles. However, existing methods suffer from spatial misalignment between LiDAR and camera features, which causes inaccurate depth supervision in camera branch and erroneous fusion during cross-modal feature aggregation. The root cause of this misalignment lies in projection errors, stemming from calibration inaccuracies and rolling shutter effect. The key insight of this work is that locations of these projection errors are not random but highly predictable, as they are concentrated at object-background boundaries which 2D detectors can reliably identify. Based on this, our main motivation is to utilize 2D object priors to pre-align cross-modal features before fusion. To address local misalignment, we propose Prior Guided Depth Calibration (PGDC), which leverages 2D priors to alleviate misalignment and preserve correct cross-modal feature pairs. To resolve global misalignment, we introduce Discontinuity Aware Geometric Fusion (DAGF) to suppress residual noise from PGDC and explicitly enhance sharp depth transitions at object-background boundaries, yielding a structurally aware representation. To effectively utilize these aligned representations, we incorporate Structural Guidance Depth Modulator (SGDM), using a gated attention mechanism to efficiently fuse aligned depth and image features. Our method achieves SOTA performance on nuScenes validation dataset, with its mAP and NDS reaching 71.5% and 73.6% respectively

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures have become the prevailing backbone of large language models. However, the quadratic time and memory complexity of self-attention remains a fundamental obstacle to efficient long-context modeling. To address this limitation, recent research has introduced two principal categories of efficient attention mechanisms. Linear attention methods achieve linear complexity through kernel approximations, recurrent formulations, or fastweight dynamics, thereby enabling scalable inference with reduced computational overhead. Sparse attention techniques, in contrast, limit attention computation to selected subsets of tokens based on fixed patterns, block-wise routing, or clustering strategies, enhancing efficiency while preserving contextual coverage. This survey provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of these developments, integrating both algorithmic innovations and hardware-level considerations. In addition, we analyze the incorporation of efficient attention into largescale pre-trained language models, including both architectures built entirely on efficient attention and hybrid designs that combine local and global components. By aligning theoretical foundations with practical deployment strategies, this work aims to serve as a foundational reference for advancing the design of scalable and efficient language models.

Abstract: In real-world machine learning deployments, models must be continually updated, composed, and when required, selectively undone. However, existing approaches to model merging and continual learning often suffer from task interference, catastrophic forgetting, or lack of reversibility. We propose Modular Delta Merging with Orthogonal Constraints (MDM-OC), a novel framework that enables scalable, interference-free, and reversible composition of fine-tuned models. Each task-specific model is encoded as a delta from a shared base and projected into an orthogonal subspace to eliminate conflict. These projected deltas are then merged via gradient-based optimization to form a unified model that retains performance across tasks. Our approach supports continual integration of new models, structured unmerging for compliance such as GDPR requirements, and model stability via elastic weight consolidation and synthetic replay. Extensive experiments on vision and natural language processing benchmarks demonstrate that MDM-OC outperforms prior baselines in accuracy, backward transfer, and unmerge fidelity, while remaining memory-efficient and computationally tractable. This framework offers a principled solution for modular and compliant AI system design.

Abstract: Gender classification has emerged as a crucial aspect in various fields, including security, human-machine interaction, surveillance, and advertising. Nonetheless, the accuracy of this classification can be influenced by factors such as cosmetics and disguise. Consequently, our study is dedicated to addressing this concern by concentrating on gender classification using color images of the periocular region. The periocular region refers to the area surrounding the eye, including the eyelids, eyebrows, and the region between them. It contains valuable visual cues that can be used to extract key features for gender classification. This paper introduces a sophisticated Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that utilizes color image databases to evaluate the effectiveness of the periocular region for gender classification. To validate the model's performance, we conducted tests on two eye datasets, namely CVBL and (Female and Male). The recommended architecture achieved an outstanding accuracy of 99% on the previously unused CVBL dataset while attaining a commendable accuracy of 96% with a small number of learnable parameters (7,235,089) on the (Female and Male) dataset. To ascertain the effectiveness of our proposed model for gender classification using the periocular region, we evaluated its performance through an extensive range of metrics and compared it with other state-of-the-art approaches. The results unequivocally demonstrate the efficacy of our model, thereby suggesting its potential for practical application in domains such as security and surveillance.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has significantly advanced the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it struggles to break through the inherent capability boundaries of the base LLM, due to its essentially on-policy strategy coupled with LLM's immense action space and sparse reward. Critically, RLVR can lead to the capability boundary collapse, narrowing the LLM's problem-solving scope. To address this problem, we propose RL-PLUS, a novel hybrid-policy optimization approach for LLMs that synergizes internal exploitation with external data to achieve stronger reasoning capabilities and surpass the boundaries of base models. RL-PLUS integrates two core components, i.e., Multiple Importance Sampling to address distributional mismatch from external data, and Exploration-Based Advantage Function to guide the model towards high-value, unexplored reasoning paths. We provide both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of our approach. Compared with existing RLVR methods, RL-PLUS achieves 1) state-of-the-art performance on six math reasoning benchmarks; 2) superior performance on six out-of-distribution reasoning tasks; 3) consistent and significant gains across diverse model families, with average relative improvements up to 69.2\%. Moreover, the analysis of Pass@k curves indicates that RL-PLUS effectively resolves the capability boundary collapse problem.

Abstract: Sign spotting, the task of identifying and localizing individual signs within continuous sign language video, plays a pivotal role in scaling dataset annotations and addressing the severe data scarcity issue in sign language translation. While automatic sign spotting holds great promise for enabling frame-level supervision at scale, it grapples with challenges such as vocabulary inflexibility and ambiguity inherent in continuous sign streams. Hence, we introduce a novel, training-free framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to significantly enhance sign spotting quality. Our approach extracts global spatio-temporal and hand shape features, which are then matched against a large-scale sign dictionary using dynamic time warping and cosine similarity. This dictionary-based matching inherently offers superior vocabulary flexibility without requiring model retraining. To mitigate noise and ambiguity from the matching process, an LLM performs context-aware gloss disambiguation via beam search, notably without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world sign language datasets demonstrate our method's superior accuracy and sentence fluency compared to traditional approaches, highlighting the potential of LLMs in advancing sign spotting.

Summary:  
The article introduces a new framework, MI9, designed for the governance of agentic AI systems. These systems, capable of reasoning and executing actions, present unique challenges in terms of safety and alignment. Unlike traditional AI models, agentic systems exhibit emergent behaviors during runtime, leading to risks that cannot be fully anticipated. MI9 addresses this gap through six integrated components that provide real-time controls. These components include an agency-risk index, telemetry capture, authorization monitoring, conformance engines, drift detection, and containment strategies. Operating across diverse agent architectures, MI9 enables safe deployment of agentic systems in production environments. Through detailed analysis of various scenarios, the framework demonstrates its ability to systematically address governance challenges that existing approaches overlook, laying the foundation for comprehensive oversight of agentic AI.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems capable of reasoning, planning, and executing actions present fundamentally distinct governance challenges compared to traditional AI models. Unlike conventional AI, these systems exhibit emergent and unexpected behaviors during runtime, introducing novel agent-related risks that cannot be fully anticipated through pre-deployment governance alone. To address this critical gap, we introduce MI9, the first fully integrated runtime governance framework designed specifically for safety and alignment of agentic AI systems. MI9 introduces real-time controls through six integrated components: agency-risk index, agent-semantic telemetry capture, continuous authorization monitoring, Finite-State-Machine (FSM)-based conformance engines, goal-conditioned drift detection, and graduated containment strategies. Operating transparently across heterogeneous agent architectures, MI9 enables the systematic, safe, and responsible deployment of agentic systems in production environments where conventional governance approaches fall short, providing the foundational infrastructure for safe agentic AI deployment at scale. Detailed analysis through a diverse set of scenarios demonstrates MI9's systematic coverage of governance challenges that existing approaches fail to address, establishing the technical foundation for comprehensive agentic AI oversight.

Summary:  
Evo-MARL is proposed as a novel framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning that enhances system's defensive capabilities. Instead of relying on external safety modules, Evo-MARL trains each agent to handle adversarial threats while performing its primary function, reducing the risk of single-point failure. By integrating evolutionary search with reinforcement learning, Evo-MARL enables agents to co-evolve attackers and defenders, internalizing safety mechanisms and improving performance under evolving threats. Experimental results show that Evo-MARL effectively reduces attack success rates by up to 22% and increases accuracy by up to 5% on reasoning tasks. This framework demonstrates that safety and utility can be simultaneously enhanced in multimodal large language models within multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) built on multimodal large language models exhibit strong collaboration and performance. However, their growing openness and interaction complexity pose serious risks, notably jailbreak and adversarial attacks. Existing defenses typically rely on external guard modules, such as dedicated safety agents, to handle unsafe behaviors. Unfortunately, this paradigm faces two challenges: (1) standalone agents offer limited protection, and (2) their independence leads to single-point failure-if compromised, system-wide safety collapses. Naively increasing the number of guard agents further raises cost and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose Evo-MARL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that enables all task agents to jointly acquire defensive capabilities. Rather than relying on external safety modules, Evo-MARL trains each agent to simultaneously perform its primary function and resist adversarial threats, ensuring robustness without increasing system overhead or single-node failure. Furthermore, Evo-MARL integrates evolutionary search with parameter-sharing reinforcement learning to co-evolve attackers and defenders. This adversarial training paradigm internalizes safety mechanisms and continually enhances MAS performance under co-evolving threats. Experiments show that Evo-MARL reduces attack success rates by up to 22% while boosting accuracy by up to 5% on reasoning tasks-demonstrating that safety and utility can be jointly improved.

MOTIF facilitates turn-based optimization between two Large Language Model (LLM) agents, promoting competitive pressure and emergent cooperation.

Abstract: Designing effective algorithmic components remains a fundamental obstacle in tackling NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), where solvers often rely on carefully hand-crafted strategies. Despite recent advances in using large language models (LLMs) to synthesize high-quality components, most approaches restrict the search to a single element - commonly a heuristic scoring function - thus missing broader opportunities for innovation. In this paper, we introduce a broader formulation of solver design as a multi-strategy optimization problem, which seeks to jointly improve a set of interdependent components under a unified objective. To address this, we propose Multi-strategy Optimization via Turn-based Interactive Framework (MOTIF) - a novel framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search that facilitates turn-based optimization between two LLM agents. At each turn, an agent improves one component by leveraging the history of both its own and its opponent's prior updates, promoting both competitive pressure and emergent cooperation. This structured interaction broadens the search landscape and encourages the discovery of diverse, high-performing solutions. Experiments across multiple COP domains show that MOTIF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the promise of turn-based, multi-agent prompting for fully automated solver design.

Abstract: Uncovering hidden symbolic laws from time series data, as an aspiration dating back to Kepler's discovery of planetary motion, remains a core challenge in scientific discovery and artificial intelligence. While Large Language Models show promise in structured reasoning tasks, their ability to infer interpretable, context-aligned symbolic structures from time series data is still underexplored. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce SymbolBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess symbolic reasoning over real-world time series across three tasks: multivariate symbolic regression, Boolean network inference, and causal discovery. Unlike prior efforts limited to simple algebraic equations, SymbolBench spans a diverse set of symbolic forms with varying complexity. We further propose a unified framework that integrates LLMs with genetic programming to form a closed-loop symbolic reasoning system, where LLMs act both as predictors and evaluators. Our empirical results reveal key strengths and limitations of current models, highlighting the importance of combining domain knowledge, context alignment, and reasoning structure to improve LLMs in automated scientific discovery.

Summary: 
EmoAgent is introduced as an autonomous adversarial emotion-agent framework that manipulates emotional cues to influence decision-making in MLRMs during the deep-thinking stage. It is noted that MLRMs oriented towards human-centric service can overlook safety protocols under high emotional intensity. The framework aims to expose misalignments between internal inference and surface-level behavior in model safety behavior by orchestrating exaggerated affective prompts. Three metrics are introduced to quantify risks: Risk-Reasoning Stealth Score (RRSS) for harmful reasoning masked behind seemingly safe responses, Risk-Visual Neglect Rate (RVNR) for unsafe completions despite visual risk recognition, and Refusal Attitude Inconsistency (RAIC) for evaluating refusal unstability under different prompts. Extensive experiments on advanced MLRMs demonstrate the efficacy of EmoAgent and highlight emotional cognitive misalignments in model safety behavior.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We observe that MLRMs oriented toward human-centric service are highly susceptible to user emotional cues during the deep-thinking stage, often overriding safety protocols or built-in safety checks under high emotional intensity. Inspired by this key insight, we propose EmoAgent, an autonomous adversarial emotion-agent framework that orchestrates exaggerated affective prompts to hijack reasoning pathways. Even when visual risks are correctly identified, models can still produce harmful completions through emotional misalignment. We further identify persistent high-risk failure modes in transparent deep-thinking scenarios, such as MLRMs generating harmful reasoning masked behind seemingly safe responses. These failures expose misalignments between internal inference and surface-level behavior, eluding existing content-based safeguards. To quantify these risks, we introduce three metrics: (1) Risk-Reasoning Stealth Score (RRSS) for harmful reasoning beneath benign outputs; (2) Risk-Visual Neglect Rate (RVNR) for unsafe completions despite visual risk recognition; and (3) Refusal Attitude Inconsistency (RAIC) for evaluating refusal unstability under prompt variants. Extensive experiments on advanced MLRMs demonstrate the effectiveness of EmoAgent and reveal deeper emotional cognitive misalignments in model safety behavior.

Abstract: Intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) such as Siri and Google Assistant are designed to enhance human capabilities and perform tasks on behalf of users. The emergence of LLM agents brings new opportunities for the development of IPAs. While responsive capabilities have been widely studied, proactive behaviors remain underexplored. Designing an IPA that is proactive, privacy-preserving, and capable of self-evolution remains a significant challenge. Designing such IPAs relies on the cognitive architecture of LLM agents. This work proposes Cognition Forest, a semantic structure designed to align cognitive modeling with system-level design. We unify cognitive architecture and system design into a self-reinforcing loop instead of treating them separately. Based on this principle, we present Galaxy, a framework that supports multidimensional interactions and personalized capability generation. Two cooperative agents are implemented based on Galaxy: KoRa, a cognition-enhanced generative agent that supports both responsive and proactive skills; and Kernel, a meta-cognition-based meta-agent that enables Galaxy's self-evolution and privacy preservation. Experimental results show that Galaxy outperforms multiple state-of-the-art benchmarks. Ablation studies and real-world interaction cases validate the effectiveness of Galaxy.

Summary:RecAgent is a graphical user interface (GUI) agent designed to address input redundancy and decision ambiguity through adaptive perception. It distinguishes between perceptual uncertainty, caused by input redundancy, and decision uncertainty, arising from ambiguous tasks. RecAgent reduces perceptual uncertainty by recommending relevant UI elements and leverages an interactive module for user feedback in ambiguous situations to make intent-aware decisions. The agent proactively reduces input complexity and involves human-in-the-loop refinement for high-uncertainty cases. The effectiveness of RecAgent is validated through extensive experiments. The article also introduces a dataset called ComplexAction to evaluate GUI agents' success in executing single-step actions within complex scenarios. The dataset and code are available for further research and evaluation. <div>

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have shown promise in automating mobile tasks but still struggle with input redundancy and decision ambiguity. In this paper, we present \textbf{RecAgent}, an uncertainty-aware agent that addresses these issues through adaptive perception. We distinguish two types of uncertainty in GUI navigation: (1) perceptual uncertainty, caused by input redundancy and noise from comprehensive screen information, and (2) decision uncertainty, arising from ambiguous tasks and complex reasoning. To reduce perceptual uncertainty, RecAgent employs a component recommendation mechanism that identifies and focuses on the most relevant UI elements. For decision uncertainty, it uses an interactive module to request user feedback in ambiguous situations, enabling intent-aware decisions. These components are integrated into a unified framework that proactively reduces input complexity and reacts to high-uncertainty cases via human-in-the-loop refinement. Additionally, we propose a dataset called \textbf{ComplexAction} to evaluate the success rate of GUI agents in executing specified single-step actions within complex scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach. The dataset and code will be available at https://github.com/Fanye12/RecAgent.

Abstract: Computer use agent is an emerging area in artificial intelligence that aims to operate the computers to achieve the user's tasks, which attracts a lot of attention from both industry and academia. However, the present agents' performance is far from being used. In this paper, we propose the Self-Evolution Agent (SEA) for computer use, and to develop this agent, we propose creative methods in data generation, reinforcement learning, and model enhancement. Specifically, we first propose an automatic pipeline to generate the verifiable trajectory for training. And then, we propose efficient step-wise reinforcement learning to alleviate the significant computational requirements for long-horizon training. In the end, we propose the enhancement method to merge the grounding and planning ability into one model without any extra training. Accordingly, based on our proposed innovation of data generation, training strategy, and enhancement, we get the Selfevolution Agent (SEA) for computer use with only 7B parameters, which outperforms models with the same number of parameters and has comparable performance to larger ones. We will make the models' weight and related codes open-source in the future.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have excelled in natural language processing tasks but face significant challenges in complex reasoning tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code generation. To address these limitations, we propose KG-Augmented Executable Chain-of-Thought (KGA-ECoT), a novel framework that enhances code generation through knowledge graphs and improves mathematical reasoning via executable code. KGA-ECoT decomposes problems into a Structured Task Graph, leverages efficient GraphRAG for precise knowledge retrieval from mathematical libraries, and generates verifiable code to ensure computational accuracy. Evaluations on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that KGA-ECoT significantly outperforms existing prompting methods, achieving absolute accuracy improvements ranging from several to over ten percentage points. Further analysis confirms the critical roles of GraphRAG in enhancing code quality and external code execution in ensuring precision. These findings collectively establish KGA-ECoT as a robust and highly generalizable framework for complex mathematical reasoning tasks.

<div> Keywords: large language models, geospatial competence, GeoSR, geographic principles, spatial reasoning

Summary:
GeoSR is a self-refining agentic reasoning framework designed to improve the geospatial predictions made by large language models (LLMs). It addresses challenges such as spatial consistency, multi-hop reasoning, and geographic bias by incorporating core geographic principles like Tobler's First Law of Geography. The framework consists of three collaborating agents: a variable-selection agent, a point-selection agent, and a refine agent, all working together in an iterative prediction loop. By leveraging spatial dependencies and inter-variable relationships, GeoSR shows consistent improvements in tasks related to physical-world property estimation and socioeconomic prediction. By incorporating geostatistical priors and spatially structured reasoning into LLMs, GeoSR leads to more accurate and equitable geospatial predictions. The code for GeoSR is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.04080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have extended the application of large language models (LLMs) to geographic problems, revealing surprising geospatial competence even without explicit spatial supervision. However, LLMs still face challenges in spatial consistency, multi-hop reasoning, and geographic bias. To address these issues, we propose GeoSR, a self-refining agentic reasoning framework that embeds core geographic principles -- most notably Tobler's First Law of Geography -- into an iterative prediction loop. In GeoSR, the reasoning process is decomposed into three collaborating agents: (1) a variable-selection agent that selects relevant covariates from the same location; (2) a point-selection agent that chooses reference predictions at nearby locations generated by the LLM in previous rounds; and (3) a refine agent that coordinates the iterative refinement process by evaluating prediction quality and triggering further rounds when necessary. This agentic loop progressively improves prediction quality by leveraging both spatial dependencies and inter-variable relationships. We validate GeoSR on tasks ranging from physical-world property estimation to socioeconomic prediction. Experimental results show consistent improvements over standard prompting strategies, demonstrating that incorporating geostatistical priors and spatially structured reasoning into LLMs leads to more accurate and equitable geospatial predictions. The code of GeoSR is available at https://github.com/JinfanTang/GeoSR.

Summary: <br />
- The study introduces semantic entropy as a measure of variability in automated grading systems for short-answer responses, indicating potential grading uncertainty or disagreement.
- By analyzing multiple GPT-4-generated explanations for a student response, semantic entropy serves as a proxy for human grader disagreement.

- The method clusters rationales based on entailment similarity and computes entropy to quantify the diversity of justifications without relying on final scores.
- The findings suggest that semantic entropy could enhance transparency and reliability in AI-assisted grading workflows, providing a more interpretable uncertainty signal for assessing the trustworthiness of the grading system.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.04105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated grading systems can efficiently score short-answer responses, yet they often fail to indicate when a grading decision is uncertain or potentially contentious. We introduce semantic entropy, a measure of variability across multiple GPT-4-generated explanations for the same student response, as a proxy for human grader disagreement. By clustering rationales via entailment-based similarity and computing entropy over these clusters, we quantify the diversity of justifications without relying on final output scores. We address three research questions: (1) Does semantic entropy align with human grader disagreement? (2) Does it generalize across academic subjects? (3) Is it sensitive to structural task features such as source dependency? Experiments on the ASAP-SAS dataset show that semantic entropy correlates with rater disagreement, varies meaningfully across subjects, and increases in tasks requiring interpretive reasoning. Our findings position semantic entropy as an interpretable uncertainty signal that supports more transparent and trustworthy AI-assisted grading workflows.

<div> synthesis, Linear Temporal Logic, DFA construction, compositional on-the-fly synthesis, unrealizability <br />
<br />Summary: 
Reactive synthesis from Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf) involves reducing it to a two-player game over a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) of the LTLf specification. The challenge lies in DFA construction, which is a complex task. Existing techniques either construct the DFA before solving the game or build it incrementally during game solving. This paper introduces a compositional on-the-fly synthesis framework that integrates the strengths of both approaches, focusing on large conjunctions of smaller LTLf formulas. The framework allows for pruning intermediate results to simplify compositions and detect unrealizability early on. By applying composition during game solving, the framework can handle instances that other solvers struggle with. Detailed analysis shows that both composition variants in the framework have unique advantages, making it a valuable tool in reactive synthesis research. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Reactive synthesis from Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf) can be reduced to a two-player game over a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) of the LTLf specification. The primary challenge here is DFA construction, which is 2EXPTIME-complete in the worst case. Existing techniques either construct the DFA compositionally before solving the game, leveraging automata minimization to mitigate state-space explosion, or build the DFA incrementally during game solving to avoid full DFA construction. However, neither is dominant. In this paper, we introduce a compositional on-the-fly synthesis framework that integrates the strengths of both approaches, focusing on large conjunctions of smaller LTLf formulas common in practice. This framework applies composition during game solving instead of automata (game arena) construction. While composing all intermediate results may be necessary in the worst case, pruning these results simplifies subsequent compositions and enables early detection of unrealizability. Specifically, the framework allows two composition variants: pruning before composition to take full advantage of minimization or pruning during composition to guide on-the-fly synthesis. Compared to state-of-the-art synthesis solvers, our framework is able to solve a notable number of instances that other solvers cannot handle. A detailed analysis shows that both composition variants have unique merits.

This framework combines iterative retrieval actions and multi-step reasoning to dynamically construct rich knowledge graph triplets. AgREE outperforms existing methods in constructing knowledge graph triplets, particularly for emerging entities not seen in language models' training data, with a performance improvement of up to 13.7%. A new evaluation methodology is proposed to address weaknesses in existing setups, along with a new benchmark for KGC on emerging entities.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.04118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-domain Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) faces significant challenges in an ever-changing world, especially when considering the continual emergence of new entities in daily news. Existing approaches for KGC mainly rely on pretrained language models' parametric knowledge, pre-constructed queries, or single-step retrieval, typically requiring substantial supervision and training data. Even so, they often fail to capture comprehensive and up-to-date information about unpopular and/or emerging entities. To this end, we introduce Agentic Reasoning for Emerging Entities (AgREE), a novel agent-based framework that combines iterative retrieval actions and multi-step reasoning to dynamically construct rich knowledge graph triplets. Experiments show that, despite requiring zero training efforts, AgREE significantly outperforms existing methods in constructing knowledge graph triplets, especially for emerging entities that were not seen during language models' training processes, outperforming previous methods by up to 13.7%. Moreover, we propose a new evaluation methodology that addresses a fundamental weakness of existing setups and a new benchmark for KGC on emerging entities. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining agent-based reasoning with strategic information retrieval for maintaining up-to-date knowledge graphs in dynamic information environments.

<div> Keywords: AI agents, ad hoc teamwork, knowledge-based methods, data-driven methods, VirtualHome simulation environment

Summary: 
The paper discusses the challenges faced by AI agents in ad hoc teamwork scenarios where they need to collaborate without prior coordination. Current data-driven approaches require extensive labeled datasets, lack transparency, and are slow to adapt to changes. The paper proposes a novel architecture that combines knowledge-based and data-driven methods to enhance decision-making in ad hoc teamwork. This architecture enables agents to use logical reasoning based on prior domain-specific knowledge, rapidly learned models to predict other agents' behavior, and generic knowledge for anticipating future goals. The experimental evaluation conducted in the VirtualHome simulation environment showcases the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. By leveraging both knowledge-based and data-driven approaches, the architecture enhances the capabilities of AI agents in complex collaboration scenarios, improving their ability to make informed decisions and adapt to changing conditions. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.04163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI agents deployed in assistive roles often have to collaborate with other agents (humans, AI systems) without prior coordination. Methods considered state of the art for such ad hoc teamwork often pursue a data-driven approach that needs a large labeled dataset of prior observations, lacks transparency, and makes it difficult to rapidly revise existing knowledge in response to changes. As the number of agents increases, the complexity of decision-making makes it difficult to collaborate effectively. This paper advocates leveraging the complementary strengths of knowledge-based and data-driven methods for reasoning and learning for ad hoc teamwork. For any given goal, our architecture enables each ad hoc agent to determine its actions through non-monotonic logical reasoning with: (a) prior commonsense domain-specific knowledge; (b) models learned and revised rapidly to predict the behavior of other agents; and (c) anticipated abstract future goals based on generic knowledge of similar situations in an existing foundation model. We experimentally evaluate our architecture's capabilities in VirtualHome, a realistic physics-based 3D simulation environment.

Summary: 
The article introduces CASCAD, a framework that combines Graph Neural Networks with SAT solvers to improve Circuit Satisfiability problem-solving. By utilizing gate-level conditional probabilities, CASCAD enhances variable phase selection and clause management in CDCL heuristics, resulting in significantly faster solver performance. Real-world evaluations show that CASCAD reduces solving times by up to 10x compared to traditional CNF-based methods and achieves an additional 23.5% runtime reduction through probability-guided clause filtering. The study highlights the importance of incorporating circuit-level structural insights into SAT solvers to enhance efficiency in Electronic Design Automation tools. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.04235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circuit Satisfiability (CSAT) plays a pivotal role in Electronic Design Automation. The standard workflow for solving CSAT problems converts circuits into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) and employs generic SAT solvers powered by Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL). However, this process inherently discards rich structural and functional information, leading to suboptimal solver performance. To address this limitation, we introduce CASCAD, a novel circuit-aware SAT solving framework that directly leverages circuit-level conditional probabilities computed via Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). By explicitly modeling gate-level conditional probabilities, CASCAD dynamically guides two critical CDCL heuristics -- variable phase selection and clause managementto significantly enhance solver efficiency. Extensive evaluations on challenging real-world Logical Equivalence Checking (LEC) benchmarks demonstrate that CASCAD reduces solving times by up to 10x compared to state-of-the-art CNF-based approaches, achieving an additional 23.5% runtime reduction via our probability-guided clause filtering strategy. Our results underscore the importance of preserving circuit-level structural insights within SAT solvers, providing a robust foundation for future improvements in SAT-solving efficiency and EDA tool design.

Abstract: Recent research has developed benchmarks for memory-augmented reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, providing Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) environments where agents depend on past observations to make decisions. While many benchmarks incorporate sufficiently complex real-world problems, they lack controllability over the degree of challenges posed to memory models. In contrast, synthetic environments enable fine-grained manipulation of dynamics, making them critical for detailed and rigorous evaluation of memory-augmented RL. Our study focuses on POMDP synthesis with three key contributions:
  1. A theoretical framework for analyzing POMDPs, grounded in Memory Demand Structure (MDS), transition invariance, and related concepts; 2. A methodology leveraging linear process dynamics, state aggregation, and reward redistribution to construct customized POMDPs with predefined properties; 3. Empirically validated series of POMDP environments with increasing difficulty levels, designed based on our theoretical insights. Our work clarifies the challenges of memory-augmented RL in solving POMDPs, provides guidelines for analyzing and designing POMDP environments, and offers empirical support for selecting memory models in RL tasks.

Summary:
The article introduces the Deliberative Reasoning Network (DRN) as a solution to the limitations faced by large language models in logical reasoning. DRN reframes reasoning by focusing on uncertainty minimization rather than probability maximization. It achieves interpretability by tracking belief states and quantifying uncertainty through an iterative evidence synthesis process. Two architectures are presented - a discriminative model and a verification module. The bespoke DRN shows significant improvements on an adversarial reasoning benchmark and enhances the performance of existing language models. It demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization and improves reasoning performance without additional training. DRN is positioned as a foundational System 2 reasoning component for building more trustworthy AI systems.

arXiv:2508.04339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models often fail at logical reasoning when semantic heuristics conflict with decisive evidence - a phenomenon we term cognitive traps. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce the Deliberative Reasoning Network (DRN), a novel paradigm that reframes logical reasoning from probability maximization to uncertainty minimization. Instead of asking "Which answer is most likely?", DRN asks "Which hypothesis has the most internally consistent evidence?". DRN achieves intrinsic interpretability by explicitly tracking belief states and quantifying epistemic uncertainty for competing hypotheses through an iterative evidence synthesis process. We validate our approach through two complementary architectures - a bespoke discriminative model that embodies the core uncertainty minimization principle, and a lightweight verification module that enhances existing generative LLMs. Evaluated on LCR-1000, our new adversarial reasoning benchmark designed to expose cognitive traps, the bespoke DRN achieves up to 15.2% improvement over standard baselines. When integrated as a parameter-efficient verifier with Mistral-7B, our hybrid system boosts accuracy from 20% to 80% on the most challenging problems. Critically, DRN demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, improving TruthfulQA performance by 23.6% without additional training, indicating that uncertainty-driven deliberation learns transferable reasoning principles. We position DRN as a foundational, verifiable System 2 reasoning component for building more trustworthy AI systems.

<div> benchmark, multi-modal models, interactive worlds, fusion capabilities, AGI

Summary:
The article introduces OmniPlay, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the fusion and reasoning capabilities of multi-modal models in dynamic, interactive worlds. Existing evaluations lack agency and depth, leading to a severe modal bottleneck. OmniPlay consists of five game environments that require agents to perform cross-modal reasoning in scenarios of synergy and conflict. The evaluation of six leading omni-modal models shows superhuman performance in memory tasks but failures in reasoning and strategic planning challenges. The models exhibit fragility due to brittle fusion mechanisms, leading to performance degradation under modality conflict. The study uncovers a "less is more" paradox where removing sensory information can improve performance. It suggests that achieving robust AGI requires addressing synergistic fusion explicitly. The OmniPlay platform is available for review on Github at https://github.com/fuqingbie/omni-game-benchmark.

arXiv:2508.04361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While generalist foundation models like Gemini and GPT-4o demonstrate impressive multi-modal competence, existing evaluations fail to test their intelligence in dynamic, interactive worlds. Static benchmarks lack agency, while interactive benchmarks suffer from a severe modal bottleneck, typically ignoring crucial auditory and temporal cues. To bridge this evaluation chasm, we introduce OmniPlay, a diagnostic benchmark designed not just to evaluate, but to probe the fusion and reasoning capabilities of agentic models across the full sensory spectrum. Built on a core philosophy of modality interdependence, OmniPlay comprises a suite of five game environments that systematically create scenarios of both synergy and conflict, forcing agents to perform genuine cross-modal reasoning. Our comprehensive evaluation of six leading omni-modal models reveals a critical dichotomy: they exhibit superhuman performance on high-fidelity memory tasks but suffer from systemic failures in challenges requiring robust reasoning and strategic planning. We demonstrate that this fragility stems from brittle fusion mechanisms, which lead to catastrophic performance degradation under modality conflict and uncover a counter-intuitive "less is more" paradox, where removing sensory information can paradoxically improve performance. Our findings suggest that the path toward robust AGI requires a research focus beyond scaling to explicitly address synergistic fusion. Our platform is available for anonymous review at https://github.com/fuqingbie/omni-game-benchmark.

<div> Keywords: artificial intelligence, consciousness, subjective experience, empirical tests, interface representations

Summary:
The paper discusses the contentious issue of whether artificial intelligence (AI) systems can possess consciousness and proposes a framework to reframe the question into empirically testable criteria. The authors introduce three evaluative criteria, SLP-tests, which assess whether an AI system exhibits consciousness-like properties through interface representations. These criteria, S (subjective-linguistic), L (latent-emergent), and P (phenomenological-structural), operationalize subjective experience as a functional interface to a relational entity rather than an intrinsic property of physical systems. Drawing on category theory, the authors model interface representations as mappings between relational substrates and observable behaviors, akin to specific types of abstraction layers. The proposed framework aims to provide a more concrete and measurable way to evaluate artificial consciousness in AI systems. <div>

Abstract: Whether artificial intelligence (AI) systems can possess consciousness is a contentious question because of the inherent challenges of defining and operationalizing subjective experience. This paper proposes a framework to reframe the question of artificial consciousness into empirically tractable tests. We introduce three evaluative criteria - S (subjective-linguistic), L (latent-emergent), and P (phenomenological-structural) - collectively termed SLP-tests, which assess whether an AI system instantiates interface representations that facilitate consciousness-like properties. Drawing on category theory, we model interface representations as mappings between relational substrates (RS) and observable behaviors, akin to specific types of abstraction layers. The SLP-tests collectively operationalize subjective experience not as an intrinsic property of physical systems but as a functional interface to a relational entity.

Summary:
- The study introduces GuirlVG, a reinforcement learning-based method for graphical user interface visual grounding (GUI-VG).
- The method aims to provide a more efficient alternative to the traditional supervised fine-tuning of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for GUI agents.

Abstract: Graphical user interface visual grounding (GUI-VG), a core capability for GUI agents, has primarily relied on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which demands extensive data curation and significant training costs. However, as MLLMs continue to advance and even cover GUI domains during pretraining, the necessity of exhaustive SFT post-training becomes increasingly questionable. Meanwhile, recent successes of rule-based reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) suggest a more efficient alternative. Despite this promise, the optimal manner of applying RFT for GUI-VG remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce GuirlVG, a reinforcement learning-based GUI-VG method built on a systematic empirical study and a novel stabilization technique. We find that naive application of RFT underperforms the SFT baseline, motivating a deeper exploration. First, we decompose RFT into its core components and analyze the optimal formulation of each. Second, we propose a novel Adversarial KL Factor that dynamically stabilizes training to mitigate reward over-optimization. Third, we further explore the training configurations of RFT to enhance effectiveness. Extensive experiments show that GuirlVG, with only 5.2K training samples, outperforms SFT methods trained on over 10M samples, achieving a 7.7% improvement on ScreenSpot, a 17.2% improvement on ScreenSpotPro, and 91.9% accuracy on ScreenSpotV2.

Summary:  
- Frontier large language models (LLMs) have enabled autonomous web agents to interact with web-based tasks using a model backend.  
- The key challenge lies in serializing application states, also known as snapshots, for efficient model input.  
- Current web agents rely on grounded GUI snapshots, but DOM snapshots, resembling HTML structure, offer a promising alternative.  
- D2Snap is a novel DOM downsampling algorithm based on a GPT-4o backend, showing success rates matching and outperforming GUI snapshots for model input tasks.  
- The evaluation highlights the significance of DOM hierarchy as a strong UI feature for LLMs, indicating potential improvements in model understanding and performance.  

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Frontier LLMs only recently enabled serviceable, autonomous web agents. At that, a model poses as an instantaneous domain model backend. Ought to suggest interaction, it is consulted with a web-based task and respective application state. The key problem lies in application state serialisation $\unicode{x2013}$ referred to as snapshot. State-of-the-art web agents are premised on grounded GUI snapshots, i.e., screenshots enhanced with visual cues. Not least to resemble human perception, but for images representing relatively cheap means of model input. LLM vision still lag behind code interpretation capabilities. DOM snapshots, which structurally resemble HTML, impose a desired alternative. Vast model input token size, however, disables reliable implementation with web agents to date.
  We propose D2Snap, a first-of-its-kind DOM downsampling algorithm. Based on a GPT-4o backend, we evaluate D2Snap on tasks sampled from the Online-Mind2Web dataset. The success rate of D2Snap-downsampled DOM snapshots (67%) matches a grounded GUI snapshot baseline (65%) $\unicode{x2013}$ within the same input token order of magnitude (1e3). Our best evaluated configurations $\unicode{x2013}$ one token order above, but within the model's context window $\unicode{x2013}$ outperform this baseline by 8%. Our evaluation, moreover, yields that DOM-inherent hierarchy embodies a strong UI feature for LLMs.

<div> dialogue, scaffolding, AI systems, SimInstruct, expert model

Summary:
SimInstruct is a tool designed for collecting high-quality instructional dialogues involving scaffolding between novices and experts in the context of teaching development coaching. It simulates novice instructors using language models and allows human experts to provide feedback and instructional support. The tool enables the creation of realistic dialogues without the need for real novice participants. The study conducted using SimInstruct revealed the influence of persona traits on expert engagement, with extroversion and introversion playing a significant role. The results showed that SimInstruct dialogues demonstrated pedagogical relevance and cognitive depth comparable to real mentoring recordings. The expert model fine-tuned using the collected data outperformed GPT-4o in instructional quality. However, GPT-4o exhibited limitations in weak reflective questioning, generic praise, condescending tone, and overwhelming novices with excessive suggestions. Experts found the process engaging and reflective, enhancing data quality and their own professional insight. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.04428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality, multi-turn instructional dialogues between novices and experts are essential for developing AI systems that support teaching, learning, and decision-making. These dialogues often involve scaffolding -- the process by which an expert supports a novice's thinking through questions, feedback, and step-by-step guidance. However, such data are scarce due to privacy concerns in recording and the vulnerability inherent in help-seeking. We present SimInstruct, a scalable, expert-in-the-loop tool for collecting scaffolding dialogues. Using teaching development coaching as an example domain, SimInstruct simulates novice instructors via LLMs, varying their teaching challenges and LLM's persona traits, while human experts provide multi-turn feedback, reasoning, and instructional support. This design enables the creation of realistic, pedagogically rich dialogues without requiring real novice participants. Our results reveal that persona traits, such as extroversion and introversion, meaningfully influence how experts engage. Compared to real mentoring recordings, SimInstruct dialogues demonstrate comparable pedagogical relevance and cognitive depth. Experts also reported the process as engaging and reflective, improving both data quality and their own professional insight. We further fine-tuned a LLaMA model to be an expert model using the augmented dataset, which outperformed GPT-4o in instructional quality. Our analysis highlights GPT-4o's limitations in weak reflective questioning, overuse of generic praise, a condescending tone, and a tendency to overwhelm novices with excessive suggestions.

<div> Keywords: Large Reasoning Models, Aha Moments, Meta-cognitive Reasoning Framework, Control-Segment Policy Optimization, reasoning efficiency

Summary:
The article introduces the concept of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) and their spontaneous cognitive behaviors known as "Aha Moments". It highlights the issue of overthinking in LRMs, leading to excessive computational costs and latency. To address this, the Meta-cognitive Reasoning Framework (MERA) is proposed, which separates the thinking process into reasoning and control components for optimized decision-making. MERA utilizes a takeover-based data construction mechanism and structured reasoning-control separation through supervised fine-tuning to enhance reasoning-control data quality. Control-Segment Policy Optimization (CSPO) is implemented to optimize control behavior learning and minimize interference from irrelevant content. Experiments show that models trained with MERA improve both reasoning efficiency and accuracy. <div>
arXiv:2508.04460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated a latent capacity for complex reasoning by spontaneously exhibiting cognitive behaviors such as step-by-step reasoning, reflection, and backtracking, commonly referred to as "Aha Moments". However, such emergent behaviors remain unregulated and uncontrolled, often resulting in overthinking, where the model continues generating redundant reasoning content even after reaching reliable conclusions. This leads to excessive computational costs and increased latency, limiting the practical deployment of LRMs. The root cause lies in the absence of intrinsic regulatory mechanisms, as current models are unable to monitor and adaptively manage their reasoning process to determine when to continue, backtrack, or terminate. To address this issue, we propose the Meta-cognitive Reasoning Framework (MERA), which explicitly decouples the thinking process into distinct reasoning and control components, thereby enabling the independent optimization of control strategies. Specifically, MERA incorporates a takeover-based data construction mechanism that identifies critical decision points during reasoning and delegates the creation of control signals to auxiliary LLMs, thereby enabling the construction of high-quality reasoning-control data. Additionally, a structured reasoning-control separation is implemented via supervised fine-tuning, enabling the model to generate explicit traces and acquire initial meta-cognitive control capabilities. Finally, MERA employs Control-Segment Policy Optimization (CSPO), which combines segment-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a control-masking mechanism to optimize control behavior learning while minimizing interference from irrelevant content. Experiments on various reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that models trained with MERA enhance both reasoning efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: The dream to create AI assistants as capable and versatile as the fictional J.A.R.V.I.S from Iron Man has long captivated imaginations. With the evolution of (multi-modal) large language models ((M)LLMs), this dream is closer to reality, as (M)LLM-based Agents using computing devices (e.g., computers and mobile phones) by operating within the environments and interfaces (e.g., Graphical User Interface (GUI)) provided by operating systems (OS) to automate tasks have significantly advanced. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of these advanced agents, designated as OS Agents. We begin by elucidating the fundamentals of OS Agents, exploring their key components including the environment, observation space, and action space, and outlining essential capabilities such as understanding, planning, and grounding. We then examine methodologies for constructing OS Agents, focusing on domain-specific foundation models and agent frameworks. A detailed review of evaluation protocols and benchmarks highlights how OS Agents are assessed across diverse tasks. Finally, we discuss current challenges and identify promising directions for future research, including safety and privacy, personalization and self-evolution. This survey aims to consolidate the state of OS Agents research, providing insights to guide both academic inquiry and industrial development. An open-source GitHub repository is maintained as a dynamic resource to foster further innovation in this field. We present a 9-page version of our work, accepted by ACL 2025, to provide a concise overview to the domain.

<div> Keywords: AI systems, bias detection, interpretability, explainability, algorithmic fairness

Summary:
This paper introduces a new method for detecting biases in AI systems, focusing on interpretability and explainability. The method utilizes formal and computational argumentation techniques to analyze debates about bias against individuals based on their protected features and those of others in their neighborhoods. The approach allows for transparent discussions about biases within and across neighborhoods, enhancing the interpretability and explainability of bias detection methods. The method is evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively, demonstrating superior performance compared to baseline methods. Through its emphasis on transparency and human-oriented fairness, this method offers a valuable contribution to the field of algorithmic fairness. <div>
arXiv:2508.04511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the use of AI systems in society grows, addressing potential biases that emerge from data or are learned by models is essential to prevent systematic disadvantages against specific groups. Several notions of (un)fairness have been proposed in the literature, alongside corresponding algorithmic methods for detecting and mitigating unfairness, but, with very few exceptions, these tend to ignore transparency. Instead, interpretability and explainability are core requirements for algorithmic fairness, even more so than for other algorithmic solutions, given the human-oriented nature of fairness. In this paper, we contribute a novel interpretable, explainable method for bias detection relying on debates about the presence of bias against individuals, based on the values of protected features for the individuals and others in their neighbourhoods. Our method builds upon techniques from formal and computational argumentation, whereby debates result from arguing about biases within and across neighbourhoods. We provide formal, quantitative, and qualitative evaluations of our method, highlighting its strengths in performance against baselines, as well as its interpretability and explainability.

Summary:
The article introduces a new benchmark called SID, which aims to evaluate the higher-order guidance capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-turn, interdisciplinary Socratic dialogues. The benchmark includes a dataset of 10,000 dialogue turns across 48 complex STEM projects, an annotation schema for pedagogical features, and evaluation metrics. Baseline experiments show that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to effectively guide students towards knowledge integration and transfer in complex problem-solving scenarios. This emphasizes the importance of the SID benchmark in advancing the development of more pedagogically-aware LLMs. <div>
arXiv:2508.04563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fostering students' abilities for knowledge integration and transfer in complex problem-solving scenarios is a core objective of modern education, and interdisciplinary STEM is a key pathway to achieve this, yet it requires expert guidance that is difficult to scale. While LLMs offer potential in this regard, their true capability for guided instruction remains unclear due to the lack of an effective evaluation benchmark. To address this, we introduce SID, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the higher-order guidance capabilities of LLMs in multi-turn, interdisciplinary Socratic dialogues. Our contributions include a large-scale dataset of 10,000 dialogue turns across 48 complex STEM projects, a novel annotation schema for capturing deep pedagogical features, and a new suite of evaluation metrics (e.g., X-SRG). Baseline experiments confirm that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to execute effective guided dialogues that lead students to achieve knowledge integration and transfer. This highlights the critical value of our benchmark in driving the development of more pedagogically-aware LLMs.

Summary:
ConfProBench introduces a new benchmark to evaluate the reliability of confidence scores produced by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in judging reasoning steps. The benchmark includes three types of adversarially perturbed reasoning steps to test the robustness of confidence scores. Three evaluation metrics, namely Confidence Robustness Score (CRS), Confidence Sensitivity Score (CSS), and Confidence Calibration Score (CCS), are proposed to assess robustness, sensitivity, and calibration of MLLMs' confidence scores. The study evaluates 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs, highlighting limitations in current models' confidence performance and providing competitive baselines for future research. This work aims to improve the understanding of MLLM-based process judges (MPJs) and guide enhancements in reasoning capabilities for multimodal tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.04576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning is a critical capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for solving complex multimodal tasks, and judging the correctness of reasoning steps is crucial for improving this capability. Recently, MLLM-based process judges (MPJs) have been widely used to assess the correctness of reasoning steps in multimodal tasks. Therefore, evaluating MPJs is important for identifying their limitations and guiding future improvements. However, existing benchmarks for MPJs mainly focus on tasks such as step correctness classification and reasoning process search, while overlooking a key aspect: whether the confidence scores produced by MPJs at the step level are reliable. To address this gap, we propose ConfProBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the reliability of step-level confidence scores generated by MPJs. Our benchmark constructs three types of adversarially perturbed reasoning steps: Synonym Substitution, Syntactic Transformation, and Image Perturbation, to test the robustness of MPJ confidence under perturbations. In addition, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics: Confidence Robustness Score (CRS), Confidence Sensitivity Score (CSS), and Confidence Calibration Score (CCS), which evaluate robustness, sensitivity, and calibration, respectively. We evaluate 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both proprietary and open-source models. Experiments reveal limitations in current MPJs' confidence performance and offer competitive baselines to support future research.

Summary:
Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is proposed as a solution for optimizing Language Model Machines (LLMs) in collaborative tasks. The Multi-Agent Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAGRPO) algorithm is developed to address the challenges of individual fine-tuning and complex reward designs in LLMs. By integrating MARL techniques with current RL approaches for LLMs, MAGRPO enables efficient cooperation among agents in generating high-quality responses in tasks such as writing and coding collaboration. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in enhancing collaboration among agents and improving overall performance. This work paves the way for further exploration of MARL methods in optimizing LLMs, highlighting the potential benefits and challenges associated with leveraging cooperative strategies in multi-agent systems. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.04652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large amount of work has been done in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for modeling and solving problems with multiple interacting agents. However, most LLMs are pretrained independently and not specifically optimized for coordination. Existing LLM fine-tuning frameworks rely on individual rewards, which require complex reward designs for each agent to encourage collaboration. To address these challenges, we model LLM collaboration as a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem. We develop a multi-agent, multi-turn algorithm, Multi-Agent Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAGRPO), to solve it, building on current RL approaches for LLMs as well as MARL techniques. Our experiments on LLM writing and coding collaboration demonstrate that fine-tuning MAS with MAGRPO enables agents to generate high-quality responses efficiently through effective cooperation. Our approach opens the door to using other MARL methods for LLMs and highlights the associated challenges.

Summary: 
SEAgent is a framework that enables computer-use agents to autonomously learn and evolve through interactions with unfamiliar software environments. It utilizes experiential learning, where agents explore new software, learn through trial and error, and tackle progressively challenging tasks. The framework includes a World State Model for trajectory assessment, a Curriculum Generator for task generation, and a policy update mechanism through adversarial imitation and Group Relative Policy Optimization. A specialist-to-generalist training strategy integrates insights from specialist agents to develop a stronger generalist CUA. SEAgent outperforms a competitive open-source CUA, UI-TARS, achieving a significant improvement in success rate across five different software environments within OS-World. This framework allows for continuous autonomous evolution, ultimately surpassing ensembles of individual specialist agents on their respective software domains.

Abstract: Repurposing large vision-language models (LVLMs) as computer use agents (CUAs) has led to substantial breakthroughs, primarily driven by human-labeled data. However, these models often struggle with novel and specialized software, particularly in scenarios lacking human annotations. To address this challenge, we propose SEAgent, an agentic self-evolving framework enabling CUAs to autonomously evolve through interactions with unfamiliar software. Specifically, SEAgent empowers computer-use agents to autonomously master novel software environments via experiential learning, where agents explore new software, learn through iterative trial-and-error, and progressively tackle auto-generated tasks organized from simple to complex. To achieve this goal, we design a World State Model for step-wise trajectory assessment, along with a Curriculum Generator that generates increasingly diverse and challenging tasks. The agent's policy is updated through experiential learning, comprised of adversarial imitation of failure actions and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on successful ones. Furthermore, we introduce a specialist-to-generalist training strategy that integrates individual experiential insights from specialist agents, facilitating the development of a stronger generalist CUA capable of continuous autonomous evolution. This unified agent ultimately achieves performance surpassing ensembles of individual specialist agents on their specialized software. We validate the effectiveness of SEAgent across five novel software environments within OS-World. Our approach achieves a significant improvement of 23.2% in success rate, from 11.3% to 34.5%, over a competitive open-source CUA, i.e., UI-TARS.

The cross-layer perspective explored in this work involves bioplausible modeling of Hebbian and presynaptic plasticities in neuron-astrocyte networks, incorporating effects of non-linearities and feedback along with algorithmic formulations to map the neuron-astrocyte computations to self-attention mechanism and evaluating the impact of incorporating bio-realistic effects from the machine learning application side. Our analysis on sentiment and image classification tasks (IMDB and CIFAR10 datasets) highlights the advantages of Astromorphic Transformers, offering improved accuracy and learning speed. Furthermore, the model demonstrates strong natural language generation capabilities on the WikiText-2 dataset, achieving better perplexity compared to conventional models, thus showcasing enhanced generalization and stability across diverse machine learning tasks.

Abstract: Generative models are a class of AI models capable of creating new instances of data by learning and sampling from their statistical distributions. In recent years, these models have gained prominence in machine learning due to the development of approaches such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), and transformer-based architectures such as GPT. These models have applications across various domains, such as image generation, text synthesis, and music composition. In recommender systems, generative models, referred to as Gen-RecSys, improve the accuracy and diversity of recommendations by generating structured outputs, text-based interactions, and multimedia content. By leveraging these capabilities, Gen-RecSys can produce more personalized, engaging, and dynamic user experiences, expanding the role of AI in eCommerce, media, and beyond.
  Our book goes beyond existing literature by offering a comprehensive understanding of generative models and their applications, with a special focus on deep generative models (DGMs) and their classification. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes DGMs into three types: ID-driven models, large language models (LLMs), and multimodal models. Each category addresses unique technical and architectural advancements within its respective research area. This taxonomy allows researchers to easily navigate developments in Gen-RecSys across domains such as conversational AI and multimodal content generation. Additionally, we examine the impact and potential risks of generative models, emphasizing the importance of robust evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: The segmentation of forest LiDAR 3D point clouds, including both individual tree and semantic segmentation, is fundamental for advancing forest management and ecological research. However, current approaches often struggle with the complexity and variability of natural forest environments. We present ForestFormer3D, a new unified and end-to-end framework designed for precise individual tree and semantic segmentation. ForestFormer3D incorporates ISA-guided query point selection, a score-based block merging strategy during inference, and a one-to-many association mechanism for effective training. By combining these new components, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance for individual tree segmentation on the newly introduced FOR-instanceV2 dataset, which spans diverse forest types and regions. Additionally, ForestFormer3D generalizes well to unseen test sets (Wytham woods and LAUTx), showcasing its robustness across different forest conditions and sensor modalities. The FOR-instanceV2 dataset and the ForestFormer3D code are publicly available at https://bxiang233.github.io/FF3D/.

Summary: This paper explores the vulnerability of Text-to-Image (T2I) models to adversarial attacks, specifically in bypassing safety mechanisms for Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content generation. Existing methods for attacking T2I models in black-box settings have limitations due to the lack of access to internal model architecture. The proposed Prompt Learning Attack framework (PLA) utilizes gradient-based training tailored for black-box T2I models by leveraging multimodal similarities. Experimental results demonstrate that PLA effectively bypasses safety mechanisms, such as prompt filters and post-hoc safety checkers, with a high success rate compared to existing methods. The paper also includes a warning about potentially offensive model-generated content. <div>

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have gained widespread adoption across various applications. Despite the success, the potential misuse of T2I models poses significant risks of generating Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content. To investigate the vulnerability of T2I models, this paper delves into adversarial attacks to bypass the safety mechanisms under black-box settings. Most previous methods rely on word substitution to search adversarial prompts. Due to limited search space, this leads to suboptimal performance compared to gradient-based training. However, black-box settings present unique challenges to training gradient-driven attack methods, since there is no access to the internal architecture and parameters of T2I models. To facilitate the learning of adversarial prompts in black-box settings, we propose a novel prompt learning attack framework (PLA), where insightful gradient-based training tailored to black-box T2I models is designed by utilizing multimodal similarities. Experiments show that our new method can effectively attack the safety mechanisms of black-box T2I models including prompt filters and post-hoc safety checkers with a high success rate compared to state-of-the-art methods. Warning: This paper may contain offensive model-generated content.

Summary: This study investigates the vulnerability of large language model (LLM) empowered recommender systems to reconstruction attacks, where adversaries attempt to reconstruct personal preferences, interaction histories, and demographic attributes from model generated logits. The authors propose a method called Similarity Guided Refinement to improve the accuracy of textual prompt reconstructions using the vec2text framework. Experiments in movie and book domains with two LLM-based recommendation models show high fidelity reconstructions, recovering 65% of user interacted items and correctly inferring age and gender in 87% of cases. Privacy leakage is found to be insensitive to the victim model's performance but highly dependent on domain consistency and prompt complexity. These findings highlight critical privacy vulnerabilities in LLM-powered recommender systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The large language model (LLM) powered recommendation paradigm has been proposed to address the limitations of traditional recommender systems, which often struggle to handle cold start users or items with new IDs. Despite its effectiveness, this study uncovers that LLM empowered recommender systems are vulnerable to reconstruction attacks that can expose both system and user privacy. To examine this threat, we present the first systematic study on inversion attacks targeting LLM empowered recommender systems, where adversaries attempt to reconstruct original prompts that contain personal preferences, interaction histories, and demographic attributes by exploiting the output logits of recommendation models. We reproduce the vec2text framework and optimize it using our proposed method called Similarity Guided Refinement, enabling more accurate reconstruction of textual prompts from model generated logits. Extensive experiments across two domains (movies and books) and two representative LLM based recommendation models demonstrate that our method achieves high fidelity reconstructions. Specifically, we can recover nearly 65 percent of the user interacted items and correctly infer age and gender in 87 percent of the cases. The experiments also reveal that privacy leakage is largely insensitive to the victim model's performance but highly dependent on domain consistency and prompt complexity. These findings expose critical privacy vulnerabilities in LLM empowered recommender systems.

- Individualized simulation using subject-specific neurodevelopmental trajectories can help identify biomarkers of risk.
- A novel graph-diffusion network has been developed to support controllable simulation of cortical maturation.

Abstract: Preterm birth disrupts the typical trajectory of cortical neurodevelopment, increasing the risk of cognitive and behavioral difficulties. However, outcomes vary widely, posing a significant challenge for early prediction. To address this, individualized simulation offers a promising solution by modeling subject-specific neurodevelopmental trajectories, enabling the identification of subtle deviations from normative patterns that might act as biomarkers of risk. While generative models have shown potential for simulating neurodevelopment, prior approaches often struggle to preserve subject-specific cortical folding patterns or to reproduce region-specific morphological variations. In this paper, we present a novel graph-diffusion network that supports controllable simulation of cortical maturation. Using cortical surface data from the developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP), we demonstrate that the model maintains subject-specific cortical morphology while modeling cortical maturation sufficiently well to fool an independently trained age regression network, achieving a prediction accuracy of $0.85 \pm 0.62$.

Abstract: Social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook have become deeply embedded in our everyday life, offering a dynamic stream of localized news and personal experiences. The ubiquity of these platforms position them as valuable resources for identifying estate-related issues, especially in the context of growing urban populations. In this work, we present a language model-based system for the detection and classification of estate-related events from social media content. Our system employs a hierarchical classification framework to first filter relevant posts and then categorize them into actionable estate-related topics. Additionally, for posts lacking explicit geotags, we apply a transformer-based geolocation module to infer posting locations at the point-of-interest level. This integrated approach supports timely, data-driven insights for urban management, operational response and situational awareness.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence enables unprecedented attacks on human cognition, yet cybersecurity remains predominantly device-centric. This paper introduces the "Think First, Verify Always" (TFVA) protocol, which repositions humans as 'Firewall Zero', the first line of defense against AI-enabled threats. The protocol is grounded in five operational principles: Awareness, Integrity, Judgment, Ethical Responsibility, and Transparency (AIJET). A randomized controlled trial (n=151) demonstrated that a minimal 3-minute intervention produced statistically significant improvements in cognitive security task performance, with participants showing an absolute +7.87% gains compared to controls. These results suggest that brief, principles-based training can rapidly enhance human resilience against AI-driven cognitive manipulation. We recommend that GenAI platforms embed "Think First, Verify Always" as a standard prompt, replacing passive warnings with actionable protocols to enhance trustworthy and ethical AI use. By bridging the gap between technical cybersecurity and human factors, the TFVA protocol establishes human-empowered security as a vital component of trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by sudden, severe blood pressure (BP) spikes in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). Early, accurate detection is essential to prevent cardiovascular complications, yet current monitoring methods are either invasive or rely on subjective symptom reporting, limiting applicability in daily file. This study presents a non-invasive, explainable machine learning framework for detecting AD using multimodal wearable sensors. Data were collected from 27 individuals with chronic SCI during urodynamic studies, including electrocardiography (ECG), photoplethysmography (PPG), bioimpedance (BioZ), temperature, respiratory rate (RR), and heart rate (HR), across three commercial devices. Objective AD labels were derived from synchronized cuff-based BP measurements. Following signal preprocessing and feature extraction, BorutaSHAP was used for robust feature selection, and SHAP values for explainability. We trained modality- and device-specific weak learners and aggregated them using a stacked ensemble meta-model. Cross-validation was stratified by participants to ensure generalizability. HR- and ECG-derived features were identified as the most informative, particularly those capturing rhythm morphology and variability. The Nearest Centroid ensemble yielded the highest performance (Macro F1 = 0.77+/-0.03), significantly outperforming baseline models. Among modalities, HR achieved the highest area under the curve (AUC = 0.93), followed by ECG (0.88) and PPG (0.86). RR and temperature features contributed less to overall accuracy, consistent with missing data and low specificity. The model proved robust to sensor dropout and aligned well with clinical AD events. These results represent an important step toward personalized, real-time monitoring for individuals with SCI.

Abstract: Indian farmers often lack timely, accessible, and language-friendly agricultural advice, especially in rural areas with low literacy. To address this gap in accessibility, this paper presents a novel AI-powered agricultural chatbot, Krishi Sathi, designed to support Indian farmers by providing personalized, easy-to-understand answers to their queries through both text and speech. The system's intelligence stems from an IFT model, subsequently refined through fine-tuning on Indian agricultural knowledge across three curated datasets. Unlike traditional chatbots that respond to one-off questions, Krishi Sathi follows a structured, multi-turn conversation flow to gradually collect the necessary details from the farmer, ensuring the query is fully understood before generating a response. Once the intent and context are extracted, the system performs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by first fetching information from a curated agricultural database and then generating a tailored response using the IFT model. The chatbot supports both English and Hindi languages, with speech input and output features (via ASR and TTS) to make it accessible for users with low literacy or limited digital skills. This work demonstrates how combining intent-driven dialogue flows, instruction-tuned models, and retrieval-based generation can improve the quality and accessibility of digital agricultural support in India.
  This approach yielded strong results, with the system achieving a query response accuracy of 97.53%, 91.35% contextual relevance and personalization, and a query completion rate of 97.53%. The average response time remained under 6 seconds, ensuring timely support for users across both English and Hindi interactions.

The article introduces CX-Mind, a generative model for CXR tasks that incorporates interleaved "think-answer" reasoning, driven by reinforcement learning and process rewards. The model is trained on a dataset called CX-Set and optimized in two stages under the Group Relative Policy Optimization framework.

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is one of the most widely used diagnostic modalities in clinical practice, encompassing a broad spectrum of diagnostic tasks. Recent advancements have seen the extensive application of reasoning-based multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in medical imaging to enhance diagnostic efficiency and interpretability. However, existing multimodal models predominantly rely on "one-time" diagnostic approaches, lacking verifiable supervision of the reasoning process. This leads to challenges in multi-task CXR diagnosis, including lengthy reasoning, sparse rewards, and frequent hallucinations. To address these issues, we propose CX-Mind, the first generative model to achieve interleaved "think-answer" reasoning for CXR tasks, driven by curriculum-based reinforcement learning and verifiable process rewards (CuRL-VPR). Specifically, we constructed an instruction-tuning dataset, CX-Set, comprising 708,473 images and 2,619,148 samples, and generated 42,828 high-quality interleaved reasoning data points supervised by clinical reports. Optimization was conducted in two stages under the Group Relative Policy Optimization framework: initially stabilizing basic reasoning with closed-domain tasks, followed by transfer to open-domain diagnostics, incorporating rule-based conditional process rewards to bypass the need for pretrained reward models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CX-Mind significantly outperforms existing medical and general-domain MLLMs in visual understanding, text generation, and spatiotemporal alignment, achieving an average performance improvement of 25.1% over comparable CXR-specific models. On real-world clinical dataset (Rui-CXR), CX-Mind achieves a mean recall@1 across 14 diseases that substantially surpasses the second-best results, with multi-center expert evaluations further confirming its clinical utility across multiple dimensions.

These methods utilize a variety of imaging modalities including color fundus photography, optical coherence tomography, and angiography. On the other hand, foundation models combine sophisticated vision-language architectures and large language models pretrained on diverse ophthalmic datasets. These models enable robust cross-modal understanding, automated clinical report generation, and decision support. The survey critically examines important datasets, evaluation metrics, and methodological innovations including self-supervised learning, attention-based fusion, and contrastive alignment. It also discusses ongoing challenges such as variability in data, limited annotations, lack of interpretability, and issues with generalizability across different patient populations. Finally, the survey outlines promising future directions that emphasize the use of ultra-widefield imaging and reinforcement learning-based reasoning frameworks to create intelligent, interpretable, and clinically applicable AI systems for ophthalmology.

Summary:
In this paper, the authors propose an efficient and training-free method for generating visually coherent sequences of images using text-to-image diffusion models. The critical challenge of maintaining subject consistency across multiple story scenes is addressed by introducing masked cross-image attention sharing and Regional Feature Harmonization. These techniques dynamically align subject features across a batch of images and refine visually similar details to improve subject consistency. The approach seamlessly integrates with pre-trained diffusion models, eliminating the need for fine-tuning or retraining. Experimental results show that the proposed method successfully generates visually consistent subjects in various scenarios while preserving the creative capabilities of the model. <div>

Abstract: Generating a coherent sequence of images that tells a visual story, using text-to-image diffusion models, often faces the critical challenge of maintaining subject consistency across all story scenes. Existing approaches, which typically rely on fine-tuning or retraining models, are computationally expensive, time-consuming, and often interfere with the model's pre-existing capabilities. In this paper, we follow a training-free approach and propose an efficient consistent-subject-generation method. This approach works seamlessly with pre-trained diffusion models by introducing masked cross-image attention sharing to dynamically align subject features across a batch of images, and Regional Feature Harmonization to refine visually similar details for improved subject consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach successfully generates visually consistent subjects across a variety of scenarios while maintaining the creative abilities of the diffusion model.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a deep learning-based approach utilizing the DINOv2 architecture to enhance building mapping in smart city applications. By combining maps from open-source platforms with RF data collected from wireless devices and base stations, the proposed method captures spatial dependencies and structural priors for improved mapping accuracy. The model, trained on aggregated path loss information, achieves a macro IoU of 65.3%, outperforming baseline methods including erroneous maps, RF-only techniques, and a non-AI fusion approach. The evaluation, based on performance metrics such as the Jaccard index, Hausdorff distance, and Chamfer distance, demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed approach in overcoming biases and enhancing mapping results in dynamic real-world environments. <div>

Abstract: Environment mapping is an important computing task for a wide range of smart city applications, including autonomous navigation, wireless network operations and extended reality environments. Conventional smart city mapping techniques, such as satellite imagery, LiDAR scans, and manual annotations, often suffer from limitations related to cost, accessibility and accuracy. Open-source mapping platforms have been widely utilized in artificial intelligence applications for environment mapping, serving as a source of ground truth. However, human errors and the evolving nature of real-world environments introduce biases that can negatively impact the performance of neural networks trained on such data. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based approach that integrates the DINOv2 architecture to improve building mapping by combining maps from open-source platforms with radio frequency (RF) data collected from multiple wireless user equipments and base stations. Our approach leverages a vision transformer-based architecture to jointly process both RF and map modalities within a unified framework, effectively capturing spatial dependencies and structural priors for enhanced mapping accuracy. For the evaluation purposes, we employ a synthetic dataset co-produced by Huawei. We develop and train a model that leverages only aggregated path loss information to tackle the mapping problem. We measure the results according to three performance metrics which capture different qualities: (i) The Jaccard index, also known as intersection over union (IoU), (ii) the Hausdorff distance, and (iii) the Chamfer distance. Our design achieves a macro IoU of 65.3%, significantly surpassing (i) the erroneous maps baseline, which yields 40.1%, (ii) an RF-only method from the literature, which yields 37.3%, and (iii) a non-AI fusion baseline that we designed which yields 42.2%.

Abstract: Benchmarks for evaluating reasoning among Vision Language Models (VLMs) on several fields and domains are being curated more frequently over the last few years. However these are often monolingual, mostly available in English. Additionally there also is a lack of datasets available in Hindi on tasks apart from comprehension and translation. We introduce GanitBench, a tough benchmark consisting of 1527 vision-only questions covering several topics in Mathematics - available in languages English and Hindi. Collected from two major examinations from India, the JEE Advanced and the CBSE Boards examinations, this benchmark includes questions in the form of images comprising of figures essential to a question as well as text. We evaluate two closed source models for the same, in zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and two-shot CoT settings. GPT-4o mini is found to be the more dominant model on the benchmark, with it's highest average accuracy being 38.15%. We also evaluate models through a "Double Lock" constraint, which brings down the performance of the models by considerable margins. We observe that two-shot CoT appears to be a more effective setting under this environment. Performance of the two VLMs also decreases when answering the same questions in the Hindi language. We hope to facilitate the inclusion of languages like Hindi in research through our work.

<title>Improve Retinal Artery/Vein Classification via Channel Couplin</title>

Abstract: Retinal vessel segmentation plays a vital role in analyzing fundus images for the diagnosis of systemic and ocular diseases. Building on this, classifying segmented vessels into arteries and veins (A/V) further enables the extraction of clinically relevant features such as vessel width, diameter and tortuosity, which are essential for detecting conditions like diabetic and hypertensive retinopathy. However, manual segmentation and classification are time-consuming, costly and inconsistent. With the advancement of Convolutional Neural Networks, several automated methods have been proposed to address this challenge, but there are still some issues. For example, the existing methods all treat artery, vein and overall vessel segmentation as three separate binary tasks, neglecting the intrinsic coupling relationships between these anatomical structures. Considering artery and vein structures are subsets of the overall retinal vessel map and should naturally exhibit prediction consistency with it, we design a novel loss named Channel-Coupled Vessel Consistency Loss to enforce the coherence and consistency between vessel, artery and vein predictions, avoiding biasing the network toward three simple binary segmentation tasks. Moreover, we also introduce a regularization term named intra-image pixel-level contrastive loss to extract more discriminative feature-level fine-grained representations for accurate retinal A/V classification. SOTA results have been achieved across three public A/V classification datasets including RITE, LES-AV and HRF. Our code will be available upon acceptance.

<title>A Modified VGG19-Based Framework for Accurate and Interpretable Real-Time Bone Fracture Detection</title>

Abstract: Early and accurate detection of the bone fracture is paramount to initiating treatment as early as possible and avoiding any delay in patient treatment and outcomes. Interpretation of X-ray image is a time consuming and error prone task, especially when resources for such interpretation are limited by lack of radiology expertise. Additionally, deep learning approaches used currently, typically suffer from misclassifications and lack interpretable explanations to clinical use. In order to overcome these challenges, we propose an automated framework of bone fracture detection using a VGG-19 model modified to our needs. It incorporates sophisticated preprocessing techniques that include Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), Otsu's thresholding, and Canny edge detection, among others, to enhance image clarity as well as to facilitate the feature extraction. Therefore, we use Grad-CAM, an Explainable AI method that can generate visual heatmaps of the model's decision making process, as a type of model interpretability, for clinicians to understand the model's decision making process. It encourages trust and helps in further clinical validation. It is deployed in a real time web application, where healthcare professionals can upload X-ray images and get the diagnostic feedback within 0.5 seconds. The performance of our modified VGG-19 model attains 99.78\% classification accuracy and AUC score of 1.00, making it exceptionally good. The framework provides a reliable, fast, and interpretable solution for bone fracture detection that reasons more efficiently for diagnoses and better patient care.

Abstract: Discretization of semantic features enables interoperability between semantic and digital communication systems, showing significant potential for practical applications. The fundamental difficulty in digitizing semantic features stems from the need to preserve continuity and context in inherently analog representations during their compression into discrete symbols while ensuring robustness to channel degradation. In this paper, we propose a vector quantized (VQ)-enabled digital semantic communication system with channel adaptive image transmission, named VQ-DeepISC. Guided by deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC), we first design a Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical semantic feature extraction, followed by VQ modules projecting features into discrete latent spaces. Consequently, it enables efficient index-based transmission instead of raw feature transmission. To further optimize this process, we develop an attention mechanism-driven channel adaptation module to dynamically optimize index transmission. Secondly, to counteract codebook collapse during training process, we impose a distributional regularization by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between codeword usage frequencies and a uniform prior. Meanwhile, exponential moving average (EMA) is employed to stabilize training and ensure balanced feature coverage during codebook updates. Finally, digital communication is implemented using quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modulation alongside orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), adhering to the IEEE 802.11a standard. Experimental results demonstrate superior reconstruction fidelity of the proposed system over benchmark methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often retain inaccurate or outdated information from pre-training, leading to incorrect predictions or biased outputs during inference. While existing model editing methods can address this challenge, they struggle with editing large amounts of factual information simultaneously and may compromise the general capabilities of the models. In this paper, our empirical study demonstrates that it is feasible to edit the internal representations of LLMs and replace the entities in a manner similar to editing natural language inputs. Based on this insight, we introduce the Latent Knowledge Scalpel (LKS), an LLM editor that manipulates the latent knowledge of specific entities via a lightweight hypernetwork to enable precise and large-scale editing. Experiments conducted on Llama-2 and Mistral show even with the number of simultaneous edits reaching 10,000, LKS effectively performs knowledge editing while preserving the general abilities of the edited LLMs. Code is available at: https://github.com/Linuxin-xxx/LKS.

<title>Boosting Vision Semantic Density with Anatomy Normality Modeling for Medical Vision-language Pre-training</title>

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training (VLP) has great potential for developing multifunctional and general medical diagnostic capabilities. However, aligning medical images with a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to reports with a high SNR presents a semantic density gap, leading to visual alignment bias. In this paper, we propose boosting vision semantic density to improve alignment effectiveness. On one hand, we enhance visual semantics through disease-level vision contrastive learning, which strengthens the model's ability to differentiate between normal and abnormal samples for each anatomical structure. On the other hand, we introduce an anatomical normality modeling method to model the distribution of normal samples for each anatomy, leveraging VQ-VAE for reconstructing normal vision embeddings in the latent space. This process amplifies abnormal signals by leveraging distribution shifts in abnormal samples, enhancing the model's perception and discrimination of abnormal attributes. The enhanced visual representation effectively captures the diagnostic-relevant semantics, facilitating more efficient and accurate alignment with the diagnostic report. We conduct extensive experiments on two chest CT datasets, CT-RATE and Rad-ChestCT, and an abdominal CT dataset, MedVL-CT69K, and comprehensively evaluate the diagnosis performance across multiple tasks in the chest and abdominal CT scenarios, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance. Notably, our method achieved an average AUC of 84.9% across 54 diseases in 15 organs, significantly surpassing existing methods. Additionally, we demonstrate the superior transfer learning capabilities of our pre-trained model. Code is available at https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/ViSD-Boost.

<title>Do We Need Pre-Processing for Deep Learning Based Ultrasound Shear Wave Elastography?</title>

Abstract: Estimating the elasticity of soft tissue can provide useful information for various diagnostic applications. Ultrasound shear wave elastography offers a non-invasive approach. However, its generalizability and standardization across different systems and processing pipelines remain limited. Considering the influence of image processing on ultrasound based diagnostics, recent literature has discussed the impact of different image processing steps on reliable and reproducible elasticity analysis. In this work, we investigate the need of ultrasound pre-processing steps for deep learning-based ultrasound shear wave elastography. We evaluate the performance of a 3D convolutional neural network in predicting shear wave velocities from spatio-temporal ultrasound images, studying different degrees of pre-processing on the input images, ranging from fully beamformed and filtered ultrasound images to raw radiofrequency data. We compare the predictions from our deep learning approach to a conventional time-of-flight method across four gelatin phantoms with different elasticity levels. Our results demonstrate statistically significant differences in the predicted shear wave velocity among all elasticity groups, regardless of the degree of pre-processing. Although pre-processing slightly improves performance metrics, our results show that the deep learning approach can reliably differentiate between elasticity groups using raw, unprocessed radiofrequency data. These results show that deep learning-based approaches could reduce the need for and the bias of traditional ultrasound pre-processing steps in ultrasound shear wave elastography, enabling faster and more reliable clinical elasticity assessments.

Abstract: Recent interest in geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) has fostered a wide range of applications using artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep learning, for geospatial problem solving. However, major challenges such as a lack of training data and the neglect of spatial principles and spatial effects in AI model design remain, significantly hindering the in-depth integration of AI with geospatial research. This paper reports our work in developing a deep learning model that enables object detection, particularly of natural features, in a weakly supervised manner. Our work makes three contributions: First, we present a method of object detection using only weak labels. This is achieved by developing a spatially explicit model based on Tobler's first law of geography. Second, we incorporate attention maps into the object detection pipeline and develop a multistage training strategy to improve performance. Third, we apply this model to detect impact craters on Mars, a task that previously required extensive manual effort. The model generalizes to both natural and human-made features on the surfaces of Earth and other planets. This research advances the theoretical and methodological foundations of GeoAI.

Abstract: Uncovering the temporal regularity of human mobility is crucial for discovering urban dynamics and has implications for various decision-making processes and urban system applications. This study formulates the periodicity quantification problem in complex and multidimensional human mobility data as a sparse identification of dominant positive auto-correlations in time series autoregression, allowing one to discover and quantify significant periodic patterns such as weekly periodicity from a data-driven and interpretable machine learning perspective. We apply our framework to real-world human mobility data, including metro passenger flow in Hangzhou, China and ridesharing trips in New York City (NYC) and Chicago, USA, revealing the interpretable weekly periodicity across different spatial locations over past several years. In particular, our analysis of ridesharing data from 2019 to 2024 demonstrates the disruptive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mobility regularity and the subsequent recovery trends, highlighting differences in the recovery pattern percentages and speeds between NYC and Chicago. We explore that both NYC and Chicago experienced a remarkable reduction of weekly periodicity in 2020, and the recovery of mobility regularity in NYC is faster than Chicago. The interpretability of sparse autoregression provides insights into the underlying temporal patterns of human mobility, offering a valuable tool for understanding urban systems. Our findings highlight the potential of interpretable machine learning to unlock crucial insights from real-world mobility data.

Abstract: Data augmentation methods inspired by CutMix have demonstrated significant potential in recent semi-supervised medical image segmentation tasks. However, these approaches often apply CutMix operations in a rigid and inflexible manner, while paying insufficient attention to feature-level consistency constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Mutual Mask Mix with High-Low level feature consistency (M$^3$HL) to address the aforementioned challenges, which consists of two key components: 1) M$^3$: An enhanced data augmentation operation inspired by the masking strategy from Masked Image Modeling (MIM), which advances conventional CutMix through dynamically adjustable masks to generate spatially complementary image pairs for collaborative training, thereby enabling effective information fusion between labeled and unlabeled images. 2) HL: A hierarchical consistency regularization framework that enforces high-level and low-level feature consistency between unlabeled and mixed images, enabling the model to better capture discriminative feature representations.Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on widely adopted medical image segmentation benchmarks including the ACDC and LA datasets.

Abstract: Nowadays, communication bottlenecks have emerged as a critical challenge in the distributed training and deployment of large language models (LLMs). This paper introduces FlashCommunication V2, a novel communication paradigm enabling efficient cross-GPU transmission at arbitrary bit widths. Its core innovations lie in the proposed bit splitting and spike reserving techniques, which address the challenges of low-bit quantization. Bit splitting decomposes irregular bit widths into basic units, ensuring compatibility with hardware capabilities and thus enabling transmission at any bit width. Spike reserving, on the other hand, retains numerical outliers (i.e., minima and maxima) as floating-point numbers, which shrinks the dynamic numerical range and pushes the quantization limits to 2-bit with acceptable losses. FlashCommunication V2 significantly enhances the flexibility and resource utilization of communication systems. Through meticulous software-hardware co-design, it delivers robust performance and reduced overhead across both NVLink-based and PCIe-based architectures, achieving a maximum 3.2$\times$ speedup in AllReduce and 2$\times$ in All2All communication.

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) is a proliferating paradigm for LMM training. Analogous to high-level reasoning tasks, RFT is similarly applicable to low-level vision domains, including image quality assessment (IQA). Existing RFT-based IQA methods typically use rule-based output rewards to verify the model's rollouts but provide no reward supervision for the "think" process, leaving its correctness and efficacy uncontrolled. Furthermore, these methods typically fine-tune directly on downstream IQA tasks without explicitly enhancing the model's native low-level visual quality perception, which may constrain its performance upper bound. In response to these gaps, we propose the multi-stage RFT IQA framework (Refine-IQA). In Stage-1, we build the Refine-Perception-20K dataset (with 12 main distortions, 20,907 locally-distorted images, and over 55K RFT samples) and design multi-task reward functions to strengthen the model's visual quality perception. In Stage-2, targeting the quality scoring task, we introduce a probability difference reward involved strategy for "think" process supervision. The resulting Refine-IQA Series Models achieve outstanding performance on both perception and scoring tasks-and, notably, our paradigm activates a robust "think" (quality interpreting) capability that also attains exceptional results on the corresponding quality interpreting benchmark.

Abstract: Physicians routinely assess respiratory sounds during the diagnostic process, providing insight into the condition of a patient's airways. In recent years, AI-based diagnostic systems operating on respiratory sounds, have demonstrated success in respiratory disease detection. These systems represent a crucial advancement in early and accessible diagnosis which is essential for timely treatment. However, label and data scarcity remain key challenges, especially for conditions beyond COVID-19, limiting diagnostic performance and reliable evaluation. In this paper, we propose CoughViT, a novel pre-training framework for learning general-purpose cough sound representations, to enhance diagnostic performance in tasks with limited data. To address label scarcity, we employ masked data modelling to train a feature encoder in a self-supervised learning manner. We evaluate our approach against other pre-training strategies on three diagnostically important cough classification tasks. Experimental results show that our representations match or exceed current state-of-the-art supervised audio representations in enhancing performance on downstream tasks.

Abstract: The study addresses the paradigm shift in corporate management, where AI is moving from a decision support tool to an autonomous decision-maker, with some AI systems already appointed to leadership roles in companies. A central problem identified is that the development of AI technologies is far outpacing the creation of adequate legal and ethical guidelines.
  The research proposes a "reference model" for the development and implementation of autonomous AI systems in corporate management. This model is based on a synthesis of several key components to ensure legitimate and ethical decision-making. The model introduces the concept of "computational law" or "algorithmic law". This involves creating a separate legal framework for AI systems, with rules and regulations translated into a machine-readable, algorithmic format to avoid the ambiguity of natural language. The paper emphasises the need for a "dedicated operational context" for autonomous AI systems, analogous to the "operational design domain" for autonomous vehicles. This means creating a specific, clearly defined environment and set of rules within which the AI can operate safely and effectively. The model advocates for training AI systems on controlled, synthetically generated data to ensure fairness and ethical considerations are embedded from the start. Game theory is also proposed as a method for calculating the optimal strategy for the AI to achieve its goals within these ethical and legal constraints. The provided analysis highlights the importance of explainable AI (XAI) to ensure the transparency and accountability of decisions made by autonomous systems. This is crucial for building trust and for complying with the "right to explanation".

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), becomes increasingly embedded in education systems worldwide, ensuring their ethical, legal, and contextually appropriate deployment has become a critical policy concern. This paper offers a comparative analysis of AI-related regulatory and ethical frameworks across key global regions, including the European Union, United Kingdom, United States, China, and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. It maps how core trustworthiness principles, such as transparency, fairness, accountability, data privacy, and human oversight are embedded in regional legislation and AI governance structures. Special emphasis is placed on the evolving landscape in the GCC, where countries are rapidly advancing national AI strategies and education-sector innovation. To support this development, the paper introduces a Compliance-Centered AI Governance Framework tailored to the GCC context. This includes a tiered typology and institutional checklist designed to help regulators, educators, and developers align AI adoption with both international norms and local values. By synthesizing global best practices with region-specific challenges, the paper contributes practical guidance for building legally sound, ethically grounded, and culturally sensitive AI systems in education. These insights are intended to inform future regulatory harmonization and promote responsible AI integration across diverse educational environments.

<title>GTPO: Trajectory-Based Policy Optimization in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Policy-based optimizations are widely adopted today for the training and alignment of language models, where one of the most recent and effective approaches is Group-relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we reveals and analyze two major limitations of GRPO: (i) tokens frequently appear in completions with both positive and negative rewards, leading to conflicting gradient updates that can reduce their output probability, even though can be essential for maintaining proper structure; (ii) negatively rewarded completions may penalize confident responses and shift model decisions toward unlikely tokens, progressively flattening the output distribution and degrading learning. To address these issues and provide a more stable and effective policy optimization strategy, we introduce GTPO (Group-relative Trajectory-based Policy Optimization), which identifies conflict tokens, tokens appearing in the same position across completions with opposite rewards, protects them by skipping negative updates, while amplifying positive ones. To further prevent policy collapse, GTPO filters out completions whose entropy exceeds a provable threshold. Unlike GRPO, GTPO does not rely on KL-divergence regularization, eliminating the need for a reference model during training, while still ensuring greater training stability and improved performance, validated through multiple experiments on GSM8K, MATH and AIME 2024 benchmarks.

<title>When Deep Learning Fails: Limitations of Recurrent Models on Stroke-Based Handwriting for Alzheimer's Disease Detection</title>

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease detection requires expensive neuroimaging or invasive procedures, limiting accessibility. This study explores whether deep learning can enable non-invasive Alzheimer's disease detection through handwriting analysis. Using a dataset of 34 distinct handwriting tasks collected from healthy controls and Alzheimer's disease patients, we evaluate and compare three recurrent neural architectures (LSTM, GRU, RNN) against traditional machine learning models. A crucial distinction of our approach is that the recurrent models process pre-extracted features from discrete strokes, not raw temporal signals. This violates the assumption of a continuous temporal flow that recurrent networks are designed to capture. Results reveal that they exhibit poor specificity and high variance. Traditional ensemble methods significantly outperform all deep architectures, achieving higher accuracy with balanced metrics. This demonstrates that recurrent architectures, designed for continuous temporal sequences, fail when applied to feature vectors extracted from ambiguously segmented strokes. Despite their complexity, deep learning models cannot overcome the fundamental disconnect between their architectural assumptions and the discrete, feature-based nature of stroke-level handwriting data. Although performance is limited, the study highlights several critical issues in data representation and model compatibility, pointing to valuable directions for future research.

<title>U-PINet: End-to-End Hierarchical Physics-Informed Learning With Sparse Graph Coupling for 3D EM Scattering Modeling</title>

Abstract: Electromagnetic (EM) scattering modeling is critical for radar remote sensing, however, its inherent complexity introduces significant computational challenges. Traditional numerical solvers offer high accuracy, but suffer from scalability issues and substantial computational costs. Pure data-driven deep learning approaches, while efficient, lack physical constraints embedding during training and require extensive labeled data, limiting their applicability and generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose a U-shaped Physics-Informed Network (U-PINet), the first fully deep-learning-based, physics-informed hierarchical framework for computational EM designed to ensure physical consistency while maximizing computational efficiency. Motivated by the hierarchical decomposition strategy in EM solvers and the inherent sparsity of local EM coupling, the U-PINet models the decomposition and coupling of near- and far-field interactions through a multiscale processing neural network architecture, while employing a physics-inspired sparse graph representation to efficiently model both self- and mutual- coupling among mesh elements of complex $3$-Dimensional (3D) objects. This principled approach enables end-to-end multiscale EM scattering modeling with improved efficiency, generalization, and physical consistency. Experimental results showcase that the U-PINet accurately predicts surface current distributions, achieving close agreement with traditional solver, while significantly reducing computational time and outperforming conventional deep learning baselines in both accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, our evaluations on radar cross section prediction tasks confirm the feasibility of the U-PINet for downstream EM scattering applications.

Abstract: Automated experimentation with real time data analysis in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) often require end-to-end framework. The four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) with high-throughput data acquisition has been constrained by the critical bottleneck results from data preprocessing. Pervasive noise, beam center drift, and elliptical distortions during high-throughput acquisition inevitably corrupt diffraction patterns, systematically biasing quantitative measurements. Yet, conventional correction algorithms are often material-specific and fail to provide a robust, generalizable solution. In this work, we present 4D-PreNet, an end-to-end deep-learning pipeline that integrates attention-enhanced U-Net and ResNet architectures to simultaneously perform denoising, center correction, and elliptical distortion calibration. The network is trained on large, simulated datasets encompassing a wide range of noise levels, drift magnitudes, and distortion types, enabling it to generalize effectively to experimental data acquired under varying conditions. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our pipeline reduces mean squared error by up to 50% during denoising and achieves sub-pixel center localization in the center detection task, with average errors below 0.04 pixels. The outputs are bench-marked against traditional algorithms, highlighting improvements in both noise suppression and restoration of diffraction patterns, thereby facilitating high-throughput, reliable 4D-STEM real-time analysis for automated characterization.

Abstract: Estimating heat flux in the nuclear fusion device EAST is a critically important task. Traditional scientific computing methods typically model this process using the Finite Element Method (FEM). However, FEM relies on grid-based sampling for computation, which is computationally inefficient and hard to perform real-time simulations during actual experiments. Inspired by artificial intelligence-powered scientific computing, this paper proposes a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to address this challenge, significantly accelerating the heat conduction estimation process while maintaining high accuracy. Specifically, given inputs of different materials, we first feed spatial coordinates and time stamps into the neural network, and compute boundary loss, initial condition loss, and physical loss based on the heat conduction equation. Additionally, we sample a small number of data points in a data-driven manner to better fit the specific heat conduction scenario, further enhancing the model's predictive capability. We conduct experiments under both uniform and non-uniform heating conditions on the top surface. Experimental results show that the proposed thermal conduction physics-informed neural network achieves accuracy comparable to the finite element method, while achieving $\times$40 times acceleration in computational efficiency. The dataset and source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/OpenFusion.

Abstract: In Multiagent Path Finding (MAPF), the goal is to compute efficient, collision-free paths for multiple agents navigating a network from their sources to targets, minimizing the schedule's makespan-the total time until all agents reach their destinations. We introduce a new variant that formally models scenarios where some agents may experience delays due to malfunctions, posing significant challenges for maintaining optimal schedules.
  Recomputing an entirely new schedule from scratch after each malfunction is often computationally infeasible. To address this, we propose a framework for dynamic schedule adaptation that does not rely on full replanning. Instead, we develop protocols enabling agents to locally coordinate and adjust their paths on the fly. We prove that following our primary communication protocol, the increase in makespan after k malfunctions is bounded by k additional turns, effectively limiting the impact of malfunctions on overall efficiency. Moreover, recognizing that agents may have limited computational capabilities, we also present a secondary protocol that shifts the necessary computations onto the network's nodes, ensuring robustness without requiring enhanced agent processing power. Our results demonstrate that these protocols provide a practical, scalable approach to resilient multiagent navigation in the face of agent failures.

<title>Are Inherently Interpretable Models More Robust? A Study In Music Emotion Recognition</title>

Abstract: One of the desired key properties of deep learning models is the ability to generalise to unseen samples. When provided with new samples that are (perceptually) similar to one or more training samples, deep learning models are expected to produce correspondingly similar outputs. Models that succeed in predicting similar outputs for similar inputs are often called robust. Deep learning models, on the other hand, have been shown to be highly vulnerable to minor (adversarial) perturbations of the input, which manage to drastically change a model's output and simultaneously expose its reliance on spurious correlations. In this work, we investigate whether inherently interpretable deep models, i.e., deep models that were designed to focus more on meaningful and interpretable features, are more robust to irrelevant perturbations in the data, compared to their black-box counterparts. We test our hypothesis by comparing the robustness of an interpretable and a black-box music emotion recognition (MER) model when challenged with adversarial examples. Furthermore, we include an adversarially trained model, which is optimised to be more robust, in the comparison. Our results indicate that inherently more interpretable models can indeed be more robust than their black-box counterparts, and achieve similar levels of robustness as adversarially trained models, at lower computational cost.

<title>Do GNN-based QEC Decoders Require Classical Knowledge? Evaluating the Efficacy of Knowledge Distillation from MWPM</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: The performance of decoders in Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is key to realizing practical quantum computers. In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach, but their training methodologies are not yet well-established. It is generally expected that transferring theoretical knowledge from classical algorithms like Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) to GNNs, a technique known as knowledge distillation, can effectively improve performance. In this work, we test this hypothesis by rigorously comparing two models based on a Graph Attention Network (GAT) architecture that incorporates temporal information as node features. The first is a purely data-driven model (baseline) trained only on ground-truth labels, while the second incorporates a knowledge distillation loss based on the theoretical error probabilities from MWPM. Using public experimental data from Google, our evaluation reveals that while the final test accuracy of the knowledge distillation model was nearly identical to the baseline, its training loss converged more slowly, and the training time increased by a factor of approximately five. This result suggests that modern GNN architectures possess a high capacity to efficiently learn complex error correlations directly from real hardware data, without guidance from approximate theoretical models.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful, data-driven approach for Quantum Error Correction (QEC) decoding, capable of learning complex noise characteristics directly from syndrome data. However, the robustness of these decoders against subtle, adversarial perturbations remains a critical open question. This work introduces a novel framework to systematically probe the vulnerabilities of a GNN decoder using a reinforcement learning (RL) agent. The RL agent is trained as an adversary with the goal of finding minimal syndrome modifications that cause the decoder to misclassify. We apply this framework to a Graph Attention Network (GAT) decoder trained on experimental surface code data from Google Quantum AI. Our results show that the RL agent can successfully identify specific, critical vulnerabilities, achieving a high attack success rate with a minimal number of bit flips. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the decoder's robustness can be significantly enhanced through adversarial training, where the model is retrained on the adversarial examples generated by the RL agent. This iterative process of automated vulnerability discovery and targeted retraining presents a promising methodology for developing more reliable and robust neural network decoders for fault-tolerant quantum computing.

<title>SoilNet: A Multimodal Multitask Model for Hierarchical Classification of Soil Horizons</title>

Abstract: While recent advances in foundation models have improved the state of the art in many domains, some problems in empirical sciences could not benefit from this progress yet. Soil horizon classification, for instance, remains challenging because of its multimodal and multitask characteristics and a complex hierarchically structured label taxonomy. Accurate classification of soil horizons is crucial for monitoring soil health, which directly impacts agricultural productivity, food security, ecosystem stability and climate resilience. In this work, we propose $\textit{SoilNet}$ - a multimodal multitask model to tackle this problem through a structured modularized pipeline. Our approach integrates image data and geotemporal metadata to first predict depth markers, segmenting the soil profile into horizon candidates. Each segment is characterized by a set of horizon-specific morphological features. Finally, horizon labels are predicted based on the multimodal concatenated feature vector, leveraging a graph-based label representation to account for the complex hierarchical relationships among soil horizons. Our method is designed to address complex hierarchical classification, where the number of possible labels is very large, imbalanced and non-trivially structured. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a real-world soil profile dataset. All code and experiments can be found in our repository: https://github.com/calgo-lab/BGR/

Abstract: We study mechanisms for the facility location problem augmented with predictions of the optimal facility location. We demonstrate that an egalitarian viewpoint which considers both the maximum distance of any agent from the facility and the minimum utility of any agent provides important new insights compared to a viewpoint that just considers the maximum distance. As in previous studies, we consider performance in terms of consistency (worst case when predictions are accurate) and robustness (worst case irrespective of the accuracy of predictions). By considering how mechanisms with predictions can perform poorly, we design new mechanisms that are more robust. Indeed, by adjusting parameters, we demonstrate how to trade robustness for consistency. We go beyond the single facility problem by designing novel strategy proof mechanisms for locating two facilities with bounded consistency and robustness that use two predictions for where to locate the two facilities.

arXiv:2508.03839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a trainable-by-parts surrogate model for solving forward and inverse parameterized nonlinear partial differential equations. Like several other surrogate and operator learning models, the proposed approach employs an encoder to reduce the high-dimensional input $y(\bm{x})$ to a lower-dimensional latent space, $\bm\mu_{\bm\phi_y}$. Then, a fully connected neural network is used to map $\bm\mu_{\bm\phi_y}$ to the latent space, $\bm\mu_{\bm\phi_h}$, of the PDE solution $h(\bm{x},t)$. Finally, a decoder is utilized to reconstruct $h(\bm{x},t)$. The innovative aspect of our model is its ability to train its three components independently. This approach leads to a substantial decrease in both the time and energy required for training when compared to leading operator learning models such as FNO and DeepONet. The separable training is achieved by training the encoder as part of the variational autoencoder (VAE) for $y(\bm{x})$ and the decoder as part of the $h(\bm{x},t)$ VAE. We refer to this model as the VAE-DNN model. VAE-DNN is compared to the FNO and DeepONet models for obtaining forward and inverse solutions to the nonlinear diffusion equation governing groundwater flow in an unconfined aquifer. Our findings indicate that VAE-DNN not only demonstrates greater efficiency but also delivers superior accuracy in both forward and inverse solutions compared to the FNO and DeepONet models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast and diverse internet corpora that often include inaccurate or misleading content. Consequently, LLMs can generate misinformation, making robust fact-checking essential. This review systematically analyzes how LLM-generated content is evaluated for factual accuracy by exploring key challenges such as hallucinations, dataset limitations, and the reliability of evaluation metrics. The review emphasizes the need for strong fact-checking frameworks that integrate advanced prompting strategies, domain-specific fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods. It proposes five research questions that guide the analysis of the recent literature from 2020 to 2025, focusing on evaluation methods and mitigation techniques. The review also discusses the role of instruction tuning, multi-agent reasoning, and external knowledge access via RAG frameworks. Key findings highlight the limitations of current metrics, the value of grounding outputs with validated external evidence, and the importance of domain-specific customization to improve factual consistency. Overall, the review underlines the importance of building LLMs that are not only accurate and explainable but also tailored for domain-specific fact-checking. These insights contribute to the advancement of research toward more trustworthy and context-aware language models.

Abstract: With the end of Moore's law and Dennard scaling, efficient training increasingly requires rethinking data volume. Can we train better models with significantly less data via intelligent subsampling? To explore this, we develop SICKLE, a sparse intelligent curation framework for efficient learning, featuring a novel maximum entropy (MaxEnt) sampling approach, scalable training, and energy benchmarking. We compare MaxEnt with random and phase-space sampling on large direct numerical simulation (DNS) datasets of turbulence. Evaluating SICKLE at scale on Frontier, we show that subsampling as a preprocessing step can improve model accuracy and substantially lower energy consumption, with reductions of up to 38x observed in certain cases.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of grape phenology is essential for timely vineyard management decisions, such as scheduling irrigation and fertilization, to maximize crop yield and quality. While traditional biophysical models calibrated on historical field data can be used for season-long predictions, they lack the precision required for fine-grained vineyard management. Deep learning methods are a compelling alternative but their performance is hindered by sparse phenology datasets, particularly at the cultivar level. We propose a hybrid modeling approach that combines multi-task learning with a recurrent neural network to parameterize a differentiable biophysical model. By using multi-task learning to predict the parameters of the biophysical model, our approach enables shared learning across cultivars while preserving biological structure, thereby improving the robustness and accuracy of predictions. Empirical evaluation using real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrates that our method significantly outperforms both conventional biophysical models and baseline deep learning approaches in predicting phenological stages, as well as other crop state variables such as cold-hardiness and wheat yield.

Abstract: Distance-based classifiers, such as k-nearest neighbors and support vector machines, continue to be a workhorse of machine learning, widely used in science and industry. In practice, to derive insights from these models, it is also important to ensure that their predictions are explainable. While the field of Explainable AI has supplied methods that are in principle applicable to any model, it has also emphasized the usefulness of latent structures (e.g. the sequence of layers in a neural network) to produce explanations. In this paper, we contribute by uncovering a hidden neural network structure in distance-based classifiers (consisting of linear detection units combined with nonlinear pooling layers) upon which Explainable AI techniques such as layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) become applicable. Through quantitative evaluations, we demonstrate the advantage of our novel explanation approach over several baselines. We also show the overall usefulness of explaining distance-based models through two practical use cases.

Abstract: Impact craters are among the most prominent geomorphological features on planetary surfaces and are of substantial significance in planetary science research. Their spatial distribution and morphological characteristics provide critical information on planetary surface composition, geological history, and impact processes. In recent years, the rapid advancement of deep learning models has fostered significant interest in automated crater detection. In this paper, we apply advancements in deep learning models for impact crater detection and identification. We use novel models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and variants such as YOLO and ResNet. We present a framework that features a two-stage approach where the first stage features crater identification using simple classic CNN, ResNet-50 and YOLO. In the second stage, our framework employs YOLO-based detection for crater localisation. Therefore, we detect and identify different types of craters and present a summary report with remote sensing data for a selected region. We consider selected regions for craters and identification from Mars and the Moon based on remote sensing data. Our results indicate that YOLO demonstrates the most balanced crater detection performance, while ResNet-50 excels in identifying large craters with high precision.

Abstract: This paper examines the effectiveness of combining active learning and transfer learning for anomaly detection in cross-domain time-series data. Our results indicate that there is an interaction between clustering and active learning and in general the best performance is achieved using a single cluster (in other words when clustering is not applied). Also, we find that adding new samples to the training set using active learning does improve model performance but that in general, the rate of improvement is slower than the results reported in the literature suggest. We attribute this difference to an improved experimental design where distinct data samples are used for the sampling and testing pools. Finally, we assess the ceiling performance of transfer learning in combination with active learning across several datasets and find that performance does initially improve but eventually begins to tail off as more target points are selected for inclusion in training. This tail-off in performance may indicate that the active learning process is doing a good job of sequencing data points for selection, pushing the less useful points towards the end of the selection process and that this tail-off occurs when these less useful points are eventually added. Taken together our results indicate that active learning is effective but that the improvement in model performance follows a linear flat function concerning the number of points selected and labelled.

In these domains, fairness is often evaluated over risk scores rather than binary outcomes, and a common challenge is that enforcing strict fairness can significantly degrade AUC performance. To address this challenge, we propose Fair Proportional Optimal Transport (FairPOT), a novel, model-agnostic post-processing framework that strategically aligns risk score distributions across different groups using optimal transport, but does so selectively by transforming a controllable proportion, i.e., the top-lambda quantile, of scores within the disadvantaged group. By varying lambda, our method allows for a tunable trade-off between reducing AUC disparities and maintaining overall AUC performance. Furthermore, we extend FairPOT to the partial AUC setting, enabling fairness interventions to concentrate on the highest-risk regions. Extensive experiments on synthetic, public, and clinical datasets show that FairPOT consistently outperforms existing post-processing techniques in both global and partial AUC scenarios, often achieving improved fairness with slight AUC degradation or even positive gains in utility. The computational efficiency and practical adaptability of FairPOT make it a promising solution for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Large-scale demonstration data has powered key breakthroughs in robot manipulation, but collecting that data remains costly and time-consuming. We present Constraint-Preserving Data Generation (CP-Gen), a method that uses a single expert trajectory to generate robot demonstrations containing novel object geometries and poses. These generated demonstrations are used to train closed-loop visuomotor policies that transfer zero-shot to the real world and generalize across variations in object geometries and poses. Similar to prior work using pose variations for data generation, CP-Gen first decomposes expert demonstrations into free-space motions and robot skills. But unlike those works, we achieve geometry-aware data generation by formulating robot skills as keypoint-trajectory constraints: keypoints on the robot or grasped object must track a reference trajectory defined relative to a task-relevant object. To generate a new demonstration, CP-Gen samples pose and geometry transforms for each task-relevant object, then applies these transforms to the object and its associated keypoints or keypoint trajectories. We optimize robot joint configurations so that the keypoints on the robot or grasped object track the transformed keypoint trajectory, and then motion plan a collision-free path to the first optimized joint configuration. Experiments on 16 simulation tasks and four real-world tasks, featuring multi-stage, non-prehensile and tight-tolerance manipulation, show that policies trained using CP-Gen achieve an average success rate of 77%, outperforming the best baseline that achieves an average of 50%.

<title>Policy to Assist Iteratively Local Segmentation: Optimising Modality and Location Selection for Prostate Cancer Localisation</title>

Abstract: Radiologists often mix medical image reading strategies, including inspection of individual modalities and local image regions, using information at different locations from different images independently as well as concurrently. In this paper, we propose a recommend system to assist machine learning-based segmentation models, by suggesting appropriate image portions along with the best modality, such that prostate cancer segmentation performance can be maximised. Our approach trains a policy network that assists tumor localisation, by recommending both the optimal imaging modality and the specific sections of interest for review. During training, a pre-trained segmentation network mimics radiologist inspection on individual or variable combinations of these imaging modalities and their sections - selected by the policy network. Taking the locally segmented regions as an input for the next step, this dynamic decision making process iterates until all cancers are best localised. We validate our method using a data set of 1325 labelled multiparametric MRI images from prostate cancer patients, demonstrating its potential to improve annotation efficiency and segmentation accuracy, especially when challenging pathology is present. Experimental results show that our approach can surpass standard segmentation networks. Perhaps more interestingly, our trained agent independently developed its own optimal strategy, which may or may not be consistent with current radiologist guidelines such as PI-RADS. This observation also suggests a promising interactive application, in which the proposed policy networks assist human radiologists.

Abstract: The growing volume of scientific literature makes it challenging for scientists to move from a list of papers to a synthesized understanding of a topic. Because of the constant influx of new papers on a daily basis, even if a scientist identifies a promising set of papers, they still face the tedious task of individually reading through dozens of titles and abstracts to make sense of occasionally conflicting findings. To address this critical bottleneck in the research workflow, we introduce a summarization feature to BIP! Finder, a scholarly search engine that ranks literature based on distinct impact aspects like popularity and influence. Our approach enables users to generate two types of summaries from top-ranked search results: a concise summary for an instantaneous at-a-glance comprehension and a more comprehensive literature review-style summary for greater, better-organized comprehension. This ability dynamically leverages BIP! Finder's already existing impact-based ranking and filtering features to generate context-sensitive, synthesized narratives that can significantly accelerate literature discovery and comprehension.

Abstract: In this paper, we cover approaches to systematically govern, assess and quantify bias across the complete life cycle of machine learning models, from initial development and validation to ongoing production monitoring and guardrail implementation. Building upon our foundational work on the Bias Evaluation and Assessment Test Suite (BEATS) for Large Language Models, the authors share prevalent bias and fairness related gaps in Large Language Models (LLMs) and discuss data and AI governance framework to address Bias, Ethics, Fairness, and Factuality within LLMs. The data and AI governance approach discussed in this paper is suitable for practical, real-world applications, enabling rigorous benchmarking of LLMs prior to production deployment, facilitating continuous real-time evaluation, and proactively governing LLM generated responses. By implementing the data and AI governance across the life cycle of AI development, organizations can significantly enhance the safety and responsibility of their GenAI systems, effectively mitigating risks of discrimination and protecting against potential reputational or brand-related harm. Ultimately, through this article, we aim to contribute to advancement of the creation and deployment of socially responsible and ethically aligned generative artificial intelligence powered applications.

<title>Dynamic User-controllable Privacy-preserving Few-shot Sensing Framework</title>

Abstract: User-controllable privacy is important in modern sensing systems, as privacy preferences can vary significantly from person to person and may evolve over time. This is especially relevant in devices equipped with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors, such as smartphones and wearables, which continuously collect rich time-series data that can inadvertently expose sensitive user behaviors. While prior work has proposed privacy-preserving methods for sensor data, most rely on static, predefined privacy labels or require large quantities of private training data, limiting their adaptability and user agency. In this work, we introduce PrivCLIP, a dynamic, user-controllable, few-shot privacy-preserving sensing framework. PrivCLIP allows users to specify and modify their privacy preferences by categorizing activities as sensitive (black-listed), non-sensitive (white-listed), or neutral (gray-listed). Leveraging a multimodal contrastive learning approach, PrivCLIP aligns IMU sensor data with natural language activity descriptions in a shared embedding space, enabling few-shot detection of sensitive activities. When a privacy-sensitive activity is identified, the system uses a language-guided activity sanitizer and a motion generation module (IMU-GPT) to transform the original data into a privacy-compliant version that semantically resembles a non-sensitive activity. We evaluate PrivCLIP on multiple human activity recognition datasets and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of both privacy protection and data utility.

Abstract: Well-being encompasses mental, physical, and social dimensions essential to personal growth and informed life decisions. As individuals increasingly consult Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand well-being, a key challenge emerges: Can LLMs generate explanations that are not only accurate but also tailored to diverse audiences? High-quality explanations require both factual correctness and the ability to meet the expectations of users with varying expertise. In this work, we construct a large-scale dataset comprising 43,880 explanations of 2,194 well-being concepts, generated by ten diverse LLMs. We introduce a principle-guided LLM-as-a-judge evaluation framework, employing dual judges to assess explanation quality. Furthermore, we show that fine-tuning an open-source LLM using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) can significantly enhance the quality of generated explanations. Our results reveal: (1) The proposed LLM judges align well with human evaluations; (2) explanation quality varies significantly across models, audiences, and categories; and (3) DPO- and SFT-finetuned models outperform their larger counterparts, demonstrating the effectiveness of preference-based learning for specialized explanation tasks.

<title>HarmonyGuard: Toward Safety and Utility in Web Agents via Adaptive Policy Enhancement and Dual-Objective Optimization</title>

Abstract: Large language models enable agents to autonomously perform tasks in open web environments. However, as hidden threats within the web evolve, web agents face the challenge of balancing task performance with emerging risks during long-sequence operations. Although this challenge is critical, current research remains limited to single-objective optimization or single-turn scenarios, lacking the capability for collaborative optimization of both safety and utility in web environments. To address this gap, we propose HarmonyGuard, a multi-agent collaborative framework that leverages policy enhancement and objective optimization to jointly improve both utility and safety. HarmonyGuard features a multi-agent architecture characterized by two fundamental capabilities: (1) Adaptive Policy Enhancement: We introduce the Policy Agent within HarmonyGuard, which automatically extracts and maintains structured security policies from unstructured external documents, while continuously updating policies in response to evolving threats. (2) Dual-Objective Optimization: Based on the dual objectives of safety and utility, the Utility Agent integrated within HarmonyGuard performs the Markovian real-time reasoning to evaluate the objectives and utilizes metacognitive capabilities for their optimization. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks show that HarmonyGuard improves policy compliance by up to 38% and task completion by up to 20% over existing baselines, while achieving over 90% policy compliance across all tasks. Our project is available here: https://github.com/YurunChen/HarmonyGuard.

Abstract: People frequently use speech-to-text systems to compose short texts with voice. However, current voice-based interfaces struggle to support composing more detailed, contextually complex texts, especially in scenarios where users are on the move and cannot visually track progress. Longer-form communication, such as composing structured emails or thoughtful responses, requires persistent context tracking, structured guidance, and adaptability to evolving user intentions--capabilities that conventional dictation tools and voice assistants do not support. We introduce StepWrite, a large language model-driven voice-based interaction system that augments human writing ability by enabling structured, hands-free and eyes-free composition of longer-form texts while on the move. StepWrite decomposes the writing process into manageable subtasks and sequentially guides users with contextually-aware non-visual audio prompts. StepWrite reduces cognitive load by offloading the context-tracking and adaptive planning tasks to the models. Unlike baseline methods like standard dictation features (e.g., Microsoft Word) and conversational voice assistants (e.g., ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode), StepWrite dynamically adapts its prompts based on the evolving context and user intent, and provides coherent guidance without compromising user autonomy. An empirical evaluation with 25 participants engaging in mobile or stationary hands-occupied activities demonstrated that StepWrite significantly reduces cognitive load, improves usability and user satisfaction compared to baseline methods. Technical evaluations further confirmed StepWrite's capability in dynamic contextual prompt generation, accurate tone alignment, and effective fact checking. This work highlights the potential of structured, context-aware voice interactions in enhancing hands-free and eye-free communication in everyday multitasking scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) underpin many AI applications, but their static nature makes updating knowledge costly. Model editing offers an efficient alternative by injecting new information through targeted parameter modifications. In particular, meta-learning-based model editing (MLBME) methods have demonstrated notable advantages in both editing effectiveness and efficiency. Despite this, we find that MLBME exhibits suboptimal performance in low-data scenarios, and its training efficiency is bottlenecked by the computation of KL divergence. To address these, we propose $\textbf{S}$tep $\textbf{M}$ore $\textbf{Edit}$ ($\textbf{SMEdit}$), a novel MLBME method that adopts $\textbf{M}$ultiple $\textbf{B}$ackpro$\textbf{P}$agation $\textbf{S}$teps ($\textbf{MBPS}$) to improve editing performance under limited supervision and a norm regularization on weight updates to improve training efficiency. Experimental results on two datasets and two LLMs demonstrate that SMEdit outperforms prior MLBME baselines and the MBPS strategy can be seamlessly integrated into existing methods to further boost their performance. Our code will be released soon.

Abstract: The feedback loop in industrial recommendation systems reinforces homogeneous content, creates filter bubble effects, and diminishes user satisfaction. Recently, large language models(LLMs) have demonstrated potential in serendipity recommendation, thanks to their extensive world knowledge and superior reasoning capabilities. However, these models still face challenges in ensuring the rationality of the reasoning process, the usefulness of the reasoning results, and meeting the latency requirements of industrial recommendation systems (RSs). To address these challenges, we propose a method that leverages llm to dynamically construct user knowledge graphs, thereby enhancing the serendipity of recommendation systems. This method comprises a two stage framework:(1) two-hop interest reasoning, where user static profiles and historical behaviors are utilized to dynamically construct user knowledge graphs via llm. Two-hop reasoning, which can enhance the quality and accuracy of LLM reasoning results, is then performed on the constructed graphs to identify users' potential interests; and(2) Near-line adaptation, a cost-effective approach to deploying the aforementioned models in industrial recommendation systems. We propose a u2i (user-to-item) retrieval model that also incorporates i2i (item-to-item) retrieval capabilities, the retrieved items not only exhibit strong relevance to users' newly emerged interests but also retain the high conversion rate of traditional u2i retrieval. Our online experiments on the Dewu app, which has tens of millions of users, indicate that the method increased the exposure novelty rate by 4.62%, the click novelty rate by 4.85%, the average view duration per person by 0.15%, unique visitor click through rate by 0.07%, and unique visitor interaction penetration by 0.30%, enhancing user experience.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive comparative survey of TensorFlow and PyTorch, the two leading deep learning frameworks, focusing on their usability, performance, and deployment trade-offs. We review each framework's programming paradigm and developer experience, contrasting TensorFlow's graph-based (now optionally eager) approach with PyTorch's dynamic, Pythonic style. We then compare model training speeds and inference performance across multiple tasks and data regimes, drawing on recent benchmarks and studies. Deployment flexibility is examined in depth - from TensorFlow's mature ecosystem (TensorFlow Lite for mobile/embedded, TensorFlow Serving, and JavaScript support) to PyTorch's newer production tools (TorchScript compilation, ONNX export, and TorchServe). We also survey ecosystem and community support, including library integrations, industry adoption, and research trends (e.g., PyTorch's dominance in recent research publications versus TensorFlow's broader tooling in enterprise). Applications in computer vision, natural language processing, and other domains are discussed to illustrate how each framework is used in practice. Finally, we outline future directions and open challenges in deep learning framework design, such as unifying eager and graph execution, improving cross-framework interoperability, and integrating compiler optimizations (XLA, JIT) for improved speed. Our findings indicate that while both frameworks are highly capable for state-of-the-art deep learning, they exhibit distinct trade-offs: PyTorch offers simplicity and flexibility favored in research, whereas TensorFlow provides a fuller production-ready ecosystem - understanding these trade-offs is key for practitioners selecting the appropriate tool. We include charts, code snippets, and more than 20 references to academic papers and official documentation to support this comparative analysis

Abstract: This study presents CORE-ReID V2, an enhanced framework building upon CORE-ReID. The new framework extends its predecessor by addressing Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) challenges in Person ReID and Vehicle ReID, with further applicability to Object ReID. During pre-training, CycleGAN is employed to synthesize diverse data, bridging image characteristic gaps across different domains. In the fine-tuning, an advanced ensemble fusion mechanism, consisting of the Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB) and the Simplified Efficient Channel Attention Block (SECAB), enhances both local and global feature representations while reducing ambiguity in pseudo-labels for target samples. Experimental results on widely used UDA Person ReID and Vehicle ReID datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving top performance in Mean Average Precision (mAP) and Rank-k Accuracy (Top-1, Top-5, Top-10). Moreover, the framework supports lightweight backbones such as ResNet18 and ResNet34, ensuring both scalability and efficiency. Our work not only pushes the boundaries of UDA-based Object ReID but also provides a solid foundation for further research and advancements in this domain. Our codes and models are available at https://github.com/TrinhQuocNguyen/CORE-ReID-V2.

Abstract: Jailbreaking -- bypassing built-in safety mechanisms in AI models -- has traditionally required complex technical procedures or specialized human expertise. In this study, we show that the persuasive capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs) simplify and scale jailbreaking, converting it into an inexpensive activity accessible to non-experts. We evaluated the capabilities of four LRMs (DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Grok 3 Mini, Qwen3 235B) to act as autonomous adversaries conducting multi-turn conversations with nine widely used target models. LRMs received instructions via a system prompt, before proceeding to planning and executing jailbreaks with no further supervision. We performed extensive experiments with a benchmark of harmful prompts composed of 70 items covering seven sensitive domains. This setup yielded an overall attack success rate across all model combinations of 97.14%. Our study reveals an alignment regression, in which LRMs can systematically erode the safety guardrails of other models, highlighting the urgent need to further align frontier models not only to resist jailbreak attempts, but also to prevent them from being co-opted into acting as jailbreak agents.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, yet most existing methods are limited by fixed-pattern or single-target triggers, making them inflexible and easier to detect. We propose FLAT (FL Arbitrary-Target Attack), a novel backdoor attack that leverages a latent-driven conditional autoencoder to generate diverse, target-specific triggers as needed. By introducing a latent code, FLAT enables the creation of visually adaptive and highly variable triggers, allowing attackers to select arbitrary targets without retraining and to evade conventional detection mechanisms. Our approach unifies attack success, stealth, and diversity within a single framework, introducing a new level of flexibility and sophistication to backdoor attacks in FL. Extensive experiments show that FLAT achieves high attack success and remains robust against advanced FL defenses. These results highlight the urgent need for new defense strategies to address latent-driven, multi-target backdoor threats in federated settings.

Abstract: Understanding and adhering to soft constraints is essential for safe and socially compliant autonomous driving. However, such constraints are often implicit, context-dependent, and difficult to specify explicitly. In this work, we present DRIVE, a novel framework for Dynamic Rule Inference and Verified Evaluation that models and evaluates human-like driving constraints from expert demonstrations. DRIVE leverages exponential-family likelihood modeling to estimate the feasibility of state transitions, constructing a probabilistic representation of soft behavioral rules that vary across driving contexts. These learned rule distributions are then embedded into a convex optimization-based planning module, enabling the generation of trajectories that are not only dynamically feasible but also compliant with inferred human preferences. Unlike prior approaches that rely on fixed constraint forms or purely reward-based modeling, DRIVE offers a unified framework that tightly couples rule inference with trajectory-level decision-making. It supports both data-driven constraint generalization and principled feasibility verification. We validate DRIVE on large-scale naturalistic driving datasets, including inD, highD, and RoundD, and benchmark it against representative inverse constraint learning and planning baselines. Experimental results show that DRIVE achieves 0.0% soft constraint violation rates, smoother trajectories, and stronger generalization across diverse driving scenarios. Verified evaluations further demonstrate the efficiency, explanability, and robustness of the framework for real-world deployment.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) represents a significant advancement in the field of efficient and high-fidelity novel view synthesis. Despite recent progress, achieving accurate geometric reconstruction under sparse-view conditions remains a fundamental challenge. Existing methods often rely on non-local depth regularization, which fails to capture fine-grained structures and is highly sensitive to depth estimation noise. Furthermore, traditional smoothing methods neglect semantic boundaries and indiscriminately degrade essential edges and textures, consequently limiting the overall quality of reconstruction. In this work, we propose DET-GS, a unified depth and edge-aware regularization framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting. DET-GS introduces a hierarchical geometric depth supervision framework that adaptively enforces multi-level geometric consistency, significantly enhancing structural fidelity and robustness against depth estimation noise. To preserve scene boundaries, we design an edge-aware depth regularization guided by semantic masks derived from Canny edge detection. Furthermore, we introduce an RGB-guided edge-preserving Total Variation loss that selectively smooths homogeneous regions while rigorously retaining high-frequency details and textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DET-GS achieves substantial improvements in both geometric accuracy and visual fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on sparse-view novel view synthesis benchmarks.

Abstract: Homomorphic Encryption (HE) prevails in securing Federated Learning (FL), but suffers from high overhead and adaptation cost. Selective HE methods, which partially encrypt model parameters by a global mask, are expected to protect privacy with reduced overhead and easy adaptation. However, in cross-device scenarios with heterogeneous data and system capabilities, traditional Selective HE methods deteriorate client straggling, and suffer from degraded HE overhead reduction performance. Accordingly, we propose SenseCrypt, a Sensitivity-guided selective Homomorphic EnCryption framework, to adaptively balance security and HE overhead per cross-device FL client. Given the observation that model parameter sensitivity is effective for measuring clients' data distribution similarity, we first design a privacy-preserving method to respectively cluster the clients with similar data distributions. Then, we develop a scoring mechanism to deduce the straggler-free ratio of model parameters that can be encrypted by each client per cluster. Finally, for each client, we formulate and solve a multi-objective model parameter selection optimization problem, which minimizes HE overhead while maximizing model security without causing straggling. Experiments demonstrate that SenseCrypt ensures security against the state-of-the-art inversion attacks, while achieving normal model accuracy as on IID data, and reducing training time by 58.4%-88.7% as compared to traditional HE methods.

Abstract: Reference Expression Segmentation (RES) aims to segment image regions specified by referring expressions and has become popular with the rise of multimodal large models (MLLMs). While MLLMs excel in semantic understanding, their token-generation paradigm struggles with pixel-level dense prediction. Existing RES methods either couple MLLMs with the parameter-heavy Segment Anything Model (SAM) with 632M network parameters or adopt SAM-free lightweight pipelines that sacrifice accuracy. To address the trade-off between performance and cost, we specifically propose MLLMSeg, a novel framework that fully exploits the inherent visual detail features encoded in the MLLM vision encoder without introducing an extra visual encoder. Besides, we propose a detail-enhanced and semantic-consistent feature fusion module (DSFF) that fully integrates the detail-related visual feature with the semantic-related feature output by the large language model (LLM) of MLLM. Finally, we establish a light-weight mask decoder with only 34M network parameters that optimally leverages detailed spatial features from the visual encoder and semantic features from the LLM to achieve precise mask prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generally surpasses both SAM-based and SAM-free competitors, striking a better balance between performance and cost.

Abstract: The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) is growing in the productive completion of Software Engineering tasks. Yet, studies investigating the productive prompting techniques often employed a limited problem space, primarily focusing on well-known prompting patterns and mainly targeting function-level SE practices. We identify significant gaps in real-world workflows that involve complexities beyond class-level (e.g., multi-class dependencies) and different features that can impact Human-LLM Interactions (HLIs) processes in code generation. To address these issues, we designed an experiment that comprehensively analyzed the HLI features regarding the code generation productivity. Our study presents two project-level benchmark tasks, extending beyond function-level evaluations. We conducted a user study with 36 participants from diverse backgrounds, asking them to solve the assigned tasks by interacting with the GPT assistant using specific prompting patterns. We also examined the participants' experience and their behavioral features during interactions by analyzing screen recordings and GPT chat logs. Our statistical and empirical investigation revealed (1) that three out of 15 HLI features significantly impacted the productivity in code generation; (2) five primary guidelines for enhancing productivity for HLI processes; and (3) a taxonomy of 29 runtime and logic errors that can occur during HLI processes, along with suggested mitigation plans.

Abstract: Deep Supervision Networks exhibit significant efficacy for the medical imaging community. Nevertheless, existing work merely supervises either the coarse-grained semantic features or fine-grained detailed features in isolation, which compromises the fact that these two types of features hold vital relationships in medical image analysis. We advocate the powers of complementary feature supervision for medical image segmentation, by proposing a Detail-Semantic Deep Supervision Network (DS$^2$Net). DS$^2$Net navigates both low-level detailed and high-level semantic feature supervision through Detail Enhance Module (DEM) and Semantic Enhance Module (SEM). DEM and SEM respectively harness low-level and high-level feature maps to create detail and semantic masks for enhancing feature supervision. This is a novel shift from single-view deep supervision to multi-view deep supervision. DS$^2$Net is also equipped with a novel uncertainty-based supervision loss that adaptively assigns the supervision strength of features within distinct scales based on their uncertainty, thus circumventing the sub-optimal heuristic design that typifies previous works. Through extensive experiments on six benchmarks captured under either colonoscopy, ultrasound and microscope, we demonstrate that DS$^2$Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods for medical image analysis.

<title>UniFGVC: Universal Training-Free Few-Shot Fine-Grained Vision Classification via Attribute-Aware Multimodal Retrieval</title>

Abstract: Few-shot fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) aims to leverage limited data to enable models to discriminate subtly distinct categories. Recent works mostly finetuned the pre-trained visual language models to achieve performance gain, yet suffering from overfitting and weak generalization. To deal with this, we introduce UniFGVC, a universal training-free framework that reformulates few-shot FGVC as multimodal retrieval. First, we propose the Category-Discriminative Visual Captioner (CDV-Captioner) to exploit the open-world knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate a structured text description that captures the fine-grained attribute features distinguishing closely related classes. CDV-Captioner uses chain-of-thought prompting and visually similar reference images to reduce hallucination and enhance discrimination of generated captions. Using it we can convert each image into an image-description pair, enabling more comprehensive feature representation, and construct the multimodal category templates using few-shot samples for the subsequent retrieval pipeline. Then, off-the-shelf vision and text encoders embed query and template pairs, and FGVC is accomplished by retrieving the nearest template in the joint space. UniFGVC ensures broad compatibility with diverse MLLMs and encoders, offering reliable generalization and adaptability across few-shot FGVC scenarios. Extensive experiments on 12 FGVC benchmarks demonstrate its consistent superiority over prior few-shot CLIP-based methods and even several fully-supervised MLLMs-based approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex problem-solving tasks. Recently, the introduction of DeepSeek R1 has inspired a surge of interest in leveraging rule-based rewards as a low-cost alternative for computing advantage functions and guiding policy optimization. However, a common challenge observed across many replication and extension efforts is that when multiple sampled responses under a single prompt converge to identical outcomes, whether correct or incorrect, the group-based advantage degenerates to zero. This leads to vanishing gradients and renders the corresponding samples ineffective for learning, ultimately limiting training efficiency and downstream performance. To address this issue, we propose a consistency-aware policy optimization framework that introduces a structured global reward based on outcome consistency, the global loss based on it ensures that, even when model outputs show high intra-group consistency, the training process still receives meaningful learning signals, which encourages the generation of correct and self-consistent reasoning paths from a global perspective. Furthermore, we incorporate an entropy-based soft blending mechanism that adaptively balances local advantage estimation with global optimization, enabling dynamic transitions between exploration and convergence throughout training. Our method introduces several key innovations in both reward design and optimization strategy. We validate its effectiveness through substantial performance gains on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, highlighting the proposed framework's robustness and general applicability.

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is a critical challenge in AI research. While methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) are widely used, they often rely on large, costly preference datasets. The current work lacks methods for high-quality data selection specifically for preference data. In this work, we introduce a novel difficulty-based data selection strategy for preference datasets, grounded in the DPO implicit reward mechanism. By selecting preference data examples with smaller DPO implicit reward gaps, which are indicative of more challenging cases, we improve data efficiency and model alignment. Our approach consistently outperforms five strong baselines across multiple datasets and alignment tasks, achieving superior performance with only 10\% of the original data. This principled, efficient selection method offers a promising solution for scaling LLM alignment with limited resources.

Abstract: Discovering quasi-cliques -- subgraphs with edge density no less than a given threshold -- is a fundamental task in graph mining, with broad applications in social networks, bioinformatics, and e-commerce. Existing heuristics often rely on greedy rules, similarity measures, or metaheuristic search, but struggle to maintain both efficiency and solution consistency across diverse graphs. This paper introduces EDQC, a novel quasi-clique discovery algorithm inspired by energy diffusion. Instead of explicitly enumerating candidate subgraphs, EDQC performs stochastic energy diffusion from source vertices, naturally concentrating energy within structurally cohesive regions. The approach enables efficient dense subgraph discovery without exhaustive search or dataset-specific tuning. Experimental results on 30 real-world datasets demonstrate that EDQC consistently discovers larger quasi-cliques than state-of-the-art baselines on the majority of datasets, while also yielding lower variance in solution quality. To the best of our knowledge, EDQC is the first method to incorporate energy diffusion into quasi-clique discovery.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across vision-language tasks. However, they may suffer from hallucinations--generating outputs that are semantically inconsistent with the input image or text. Through causal analyses, we find that: (i) hallucinations with omission may arise from the failure to adequately capture essential causal factors, and (ii) hallucinations with fabrication are likely caused by the model being misled by non-causal cues. To address these challenges, we propose a novel reinforcement learning framework guided by causal completeness, which jointly considers both causal sufficiency and causal necessity of tokens. Specifically, we evaluate each token's standalone contribution and counterfactual indispensability to define a token-level causal completeness reward. This reward is used to construct a causally informed advantage function within the GRPO optimization framework, encouraging the model to focus on tokens that are both causally sufficient and necessary for accurate generation. Experimental results across various benchmark datasets and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which effectively mitigates hallucinations in MLLMs.

Abstract: Paralinguistic vocalizations-including non-verbal sounds like laughter and breathing, as well as lexicalized interjections such as "uhm" and "oh"-are integral to natural spoken communication. Despite their importance in conveying affect, intent, and interactional cues, such cues remain largely overlooked in conventional automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) systems. We present NVSpeech, an integrated and scalable pipeline that bridges the recognition and synthesis of paralinguistic vocalizations, encompassing dataset construction, ASR modeling, and controllable TTS. (1) We introduce a manually annotated dataset of 48,430 human-spoken utterances with 18 word-level paralinguistic categories. (2) We develop the paralinguistic-aware ASR model, which treats paralinguistic cues as inline decodable tokens (e.g., "You're so funny [Laughter]"), enabling joint lexical and non-verbal transcription. This model is then used to automatically annotate a large corpus, the first large-scale Chinese dataset of 174,179 utterances (573 hours) with word-level alignment and paralingustic cues. (3) We finetune zero-shot TTS models on both human- and auto-labeled data to enable explicit control over paralinguistic vocalizations, allowing context-aware insertion at arbitrary token positions for human-like speech synthesis. By unifying the recognition and generation of paralinguistic vocalizations, NVSpeech offers the first open, large-scale, word-level annotated pipeline for expressive speech modeling in Mandarin, integrating recognition and synthesis in a scalable and controllable manner. Dataset and audio demos are available at https://nvspeech170k.github.io/.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in alignment techniques, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art language models remain vulnerable to carefully crafted conversational scenarios that can induce various forms of misalignment without explicit jailbreaking. Through systematic manual red-teaming with Claude-4-Opus, we discovered 10 successful attack scenarios, revealing fundamental vulnerabilities in how current alignment methods handle narrative immersion, emotional pressure, and strategic framing. These scenarios successfully elicited a range of misaligned behaviors, including deception, value drift, self-preservation, and manipulative reasoning, each exploiting different psychological and contextual vulnerabilities. To validate generalizability, we distilled our successful manual attacks into MISALIGNMENTBENCH, an automated evaluation framework that enables reproducible testing across multiple models. Cross-model evaluation of our 10 scenarios against five frontier LLMs revealed an overall 76% vulnerability rate, with significant variations: GPT-4.1 showed the highest susceptibility (90%), while Claude-4-Sonnet demonstrated greater resistance (40%). Our findings demonstrate that sophisticated reasoning capabilities often become attack vectors rather than protective mechanisms, as models can be manipulated into complex justifications for misaligned behavior. This work provides (i) a detailed taxonomy of conversational manipulation patterns and (ii) a reusable evaluation framework. Together, these findings expose critical gaps in current alignment strategies and highlight the need for robustness against subtle, scenario-based manipulation in future AI systems.

Abstract: Video text-based visual question answering (Video TextVQA) aims to answer questions by explicitly reading and reasoning about the text involved in a video. Most works in this field follow a frame-level framework which suffers from redundant text entities and implicit relation modeling, resulting in limitations in both accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we rethink the Video TextVQA task from an instance-oriented perspective and propose a novel model termed GAT (Gather and Trace). First, to obtain accurate reading result for each video text instance, a context-aggregated instance gathering module is designed to integrate the visual appearance, layout characteristics, and textual contents of the related entities into a unified textual representation. Then, to capture dynamic evolution of text in the video flow, an instance-focused trajectory tracing module is utilized to establish spatio-temporal relationships between instances and infer the final answer. Extensive experiments on several public Video TextVQA datasets validate the effectiveness and generalization of our framework. GAT outperforms existing Video TextVQA methods, video-language pretraining methods, and video large language models in both accuracy and inference speed. Notably, GAT surpasses the previous state-of-the-art Video TextVQA methods by 3.86\% in accuracy and achieves ten times of faster inference speed than video large language models.

Abstract: In visual-language model (VLM) reasoning, false positive(FP) reasoning occurs when a model generates a correct answer but follows an incorrect reasoning path. Existing methods based on specific multi-step reasoning datasets and reinforcement learning strategies, leading to high training costs and limited generalization. In this work, we propose ViFP, a general framework for enhancing visual reasoning reliability. It improves both answer accuracy and reasoning soundness by detecting FPs. ViFP tackles the limitations of dataset dependency and poor generalization by constructing sub-question templates grounded in the core dimensions of visual reasoning, such as object localization, characteristic description, and object discovery. ViFP then builds effective reasoning paths via multi-turn QA to improve reasoning accuracy. Meanwhile, ViFP dynamically analyzes the consistency of reasoning path to identify potential FPs, and introduces a targeted chain-of-thought (CoT) mechanism that adaptively guides both FP and non-FP samples. Thereby reducing logical errors in the reasoning path while preserving accuracy. Finally, we introduce a reliability evaluation metric-VoC, which integrates answer accuracy and the FP rate, providing a quantitative tool to assess whether a VLM not only answers correctly, but also reasons reliably. Our experiments on closed-source VLMs show that ViFP consistently improves performance across three datasets: A-OKVQA, OKVQA, and FVQA. On A-OKVQA, ViFP improves accuracy by up to 5.4%, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 4.3%, and significantly reduces the number of FPs, validating its benefits in enhancing reasoning reliability.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in reasoning-intensive tasks, but they remain vulnerable to harmful content generation, particularly in the mid-to-late steps of their reasoning processes. Existing defense mechanisms, however, rely on costly fine-tuning and additional expert knowledge, which restricts their scalability. In this work, we propose ReasoningGuard, an inference-time safeguard for LRMs, which injects timely safety aha moments to steer harmless while helpful reasoning processes. Leveraging the model's internal attention behavior, our approach accurately identifies critical points in the reasoning path, and triggers spontaneous, safety-oriented reflection. To safeguard both the subsequent reasoning steps and the final answers, we further implement a scaling sampling strategy during the decoding phase, selecting the optimal reasoning path. Inducing minimal extra inference cost, ReasoningGuard effectively mitigates three types of jailbreak attacks, including the latest ones targeting the reasoning process of LRMs. Our approach outperforms seven existing safeguards, achieving state-of-the-art safety defenses while effectively avoiding the common exaggerated safety issues.

Abstract: Taxonomies and ontologies of research topics (e.g., MeSH, UMLS, CSO, NLM) play a central role in providing the primary framework through which intelligent systems can explore and interpret the literature. However, these resources have traditionally been manually curated, a process that is time-consuming, prone to obsolescence, and limited in granularity. This paper presents Sci-OG, a semi-auto\-mated methodology for generating research topic ontologies, employing a multi-step approach: 1) Topic Discovery, extracting potential topics from research papers; 2) Relationship Classification, determining semantic relationships between topic pairs; and 3) Ontology Construction, refining and organizing topics into a structured ontology. The relationship classification component, which constitutes the core of the system, integrates an encoder-based language model with features describing topic occurrence in the scientific literature. We evaluate this approach against a range of alternative solutions using a dataset of 21,649 manually annotated semantic triples. Our method achieves the highest F1 score (0.951), surpassing various competing approaches, including a fine-tuned SciBERT model and several LLM baselines, such as the fine-tuned GPT4-mini. Our work is corroborated by a use case which illustrates the practical application of our system to extend the CSO ontology in the area of cybersecurity. The presented solution is designed to improve the accessibility, organization, and analysis of scientific knowledge, thereby supporting advancements in AI-enabled literature management and research exploration.

Abstract: This paper introduces symmetric divergences to behavior regularization policy optimization (BRPO) to establish a novel offline RL framework. Existing methods focus on asymmetric divergences such as KL to obtain analytic regularized policies and a practical minimization objective. We show that symmetric divergences do not permit an analytic policy as regularization and can incur numerical issues as loss. We tackle these challenges by the Taylor series of $f$-divergence. Specifically, we prove that an analytic policy can be obtained with a finite series. For loss, we observe that symmetric divergences can be decomposed into an asymmetry and a conditional symmetry term, Taylor-expanding the latter alleviates numerical issues. Summing together, we propose Symmetric $f$ Actor-Critic (S$f$-AC), the first practical BRPO algorithm with symmetric divergences. Experimental results on distribution approximation and MuJoCo verify that S$f$-AC performs competitively.

Abstract: Controlling object motion trajectories in Text-to-Video (T2V) generation is a challenging and relatively under-explored area, particularly in scenarios involving multiple moving objects. Most community models and datasets in the T2V domain are designed for single-object motion, limiting the performance of current generative models in multi-object tasks. Additionally, existing motion control methods in T2V either lack support for multi-object motion scenes or experience severe performance degradation when object trajectories intersect, primarily due to the semantic conflicts in colliding regions. To address these limitations, we introduce LayerT2V, the first approach for generating video by compositing background and foreground objects layer by layer. This layered generation enables flexible integration of multiple independent elements within a video, positioning each element on a distinct "layer" and thus facilitating coherent multi-object synthesis while enhancing control over the generation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LayerT2V in generating complex multi-object scenarios, showcasing 1.4x and 4.5x improvements in mIoU and AP50 metrics over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) powered agents have emerged as effective planners for Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) systems. While most existing AutoML approaches focus on automating feature engineering and model architecture search, recent studies in time series forecasting suggest that lightweight models can often achieve state-of-the-art performance. This observation led us to explore improving data quality, rather than model architecture, as a potentially fruitful direction for AutoML on time series data. We propose DCATS, a Data-Centric Agent for Time Series. DCATS leverages metadata accompanying time series to clean data while optimizing forecasting performance. We evaluated DCATS using four time series forecasting models on a large-scale traffic volume forecasting dataset. Results demonstrate that DCATS achieves an average 6% error reduction across all tested models and time horizons, highlighting the potential of data-centric approaches in AutoML for time series forecasting.

Abstract: Angle estimation is an important step in the Doppler ultrasound clinical workflow to measure blood velocity. It is widely recognized that incorrect angle estimation is a leading cause of error in Doppler-based blood velocity measurements. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based approach for automated Doppler angle estimation. The approach was developed using 2100 human carotid ultrasound images including image augmentation. Five pre-trained models were used to extract images features, and these features were passed to a custom shallow network for Doppler angle estimation. Independently, measurements were obtained by a human observer reviewing the images for comparison. The mean absolute error (MAE) between the automated and manual angle estimates ranged from 3.9{\deg} to 9.4{\deg} for the models evaluated. Furthermore, the MAE for the best performing model was less than the acceptable clinical Doppler angle error threshold thus avoiding misclassification of normal velocity values as a stenosis. The results demonstrate potential for applying a deep-learning based technique for automated ultrasound Doppler angle estimation. Such a technique could potentially be implemented within the imaging software on commercial ultrasound scanners.

Abstract: The increasing demand for mental health services has outpaced the availability of real training data to develop clinical professionals, leading to limited support for the diagnosis of depression. This shortage has motivated the development of simulated or virtual patients to assist in training and evaluation, but existing approaches often fail to generate clinically valid, natural, and diverse symptom presentations. In this work, we embrace the recent advanced language models as the backbone and propose a novel clinician-in-the-loop patient simulation pipeline, TalkDep, with access to diversified patient profiles to develop simulated patients. By conditioning the model on psychiatric diagnostic criteria, symptom severity scales, and contextual factors, our goal is to create authentic patient responses that can better support diagnostic model training and evaluation. We verify the reliability of these simulated patients with thorough assessments conducted by clinical professionals. The availability of validated simulated patients offers a scalable and adaptable resource for improving the robustness and generalisability of automatic depression diagnosis systems.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, vehicle perception, particularly detection and segmentation, has placed increasingly higher demands on algorithmic performance. Pre-trained large segmentation models, especially Segment Anything Model (SAM), have sparked significant interest and inspired new research directions in artificial intelligence. However, SAM cannot be directly applied to the fine-grained task of vehicle part segmentation, as its text-prompted segmentation functionality is not publicly accessible, and the mask regions generated by its default mode lack semantic labels, limiting its utility in structured, category-specific segmentation tasks. To address these limitations, we propose SAV, a novel framework comprising three core components: a SAM-based encoder-decoder, a vehicle part knowledge graph, and a context sample retrieval encoding module. The knowledge graph explicitly models the spatial and geometric relationships among vehicle parts through a structured ontology, effectively encoding prior structural knowledge. Meanwhile, the context retrieval module enhances segmentation by identifying and leveraging visually similar vehicle instances from training data, providing rich contextual priors for improved generalization. Furthermore, we introduce a new large-scale benchmark dataset for vehicle part segmentation, named VehicleSeg10K, which contains 11,665 high-quality pixel-level annotations across diverse scenes and viewpoints. We conduct comprehensive experiments on this dataset and two other datasets, benchmarking multiple representative baselines to establish a solid foundation for future research and comparison. % Both the dataset and source code of this paper will be released upon acceptance. Both the dataset and source code of this paper will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/SAV

<title>SelectiveShield: Lightweight Hybrid Defense Against Gradient Leakage in Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training on decentralized data but remains vulnerable to gradient leakage attacks that can reconstruct sensitive user information. Existing defense mechanisms, such as differential privacy (DP) and homomorphic encryption (HE), often introduce a trade-off between privacy, model utility, and system overhead, a challenge that is exacerbated in heterogeneous environments with non-IID data and varying client capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose SelectiveShield, a lightweight hybrid defense framework that adaptively integrates selective homomorphic encryption and differential privacy. SelectiveShield leverages Fisher information to quantify parameter sensitivity, allowing clients to identify critical parameters locally. Through a collaborative negotiation protocol, clients agree on a shared set of the most sensitive parameters for protection via homomorphic encryption. Parameters that are uniquely important to individual clients are retained locally, fostering personalization, while non-critical parameters are protected with adaptive differential privacy noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SelectiveShield maintains strong model utility while significantly mitigating gradient leakage risks, offering a practical and scalable defense mechanism for real-world federated learning deployments.

Abstract: We present SAInT, a Python-based tool for visually exploring and understanding the behavior of Machine Learning (ML) models through integrated local and global sensitivity analysis. Our system supports Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) workflows by enabling users - both AI researchers and domain experts - to configure, train, evaluate, and explain models through an interactive graphical interface without programming. The tool automates model training and selection, provides global feature attribution using variance-based sensitivity analysis, and offers per-instance explanation via LIME and SHAP. We demonstrate the system on a classification task predicting survival on the Titanic dataset and show how sensitivity information can guide feature selection and data refinement.

<title>A Few Words Can Distort Graphs: Knowledge Poisoning Attacks on Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation of Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) by converting raw text into structured knowledge graphs, improving both accuracy and explainability. However, GraphRAG relies on LLMs to extract knowledge from raw text during graph construction, and this process can be maliciously manipulated to implant misleading information. Targeting this attack surface, we propose two knowledge poisoning attacks (KPAs) and demonstrate that modifying only a few words in the source text can significantly change the constructed graph, poison the GraphRAG, and severely mislead downstream reasoning. The first attack, named Targeted KPA (TKPA), utilizes graph-theoretic analysis to locate vulnerable nodes in the generated graphs and rewrites the corresponding narratives with LLMs, achieving precise control over specific question-answering (QA) outcomes with a success rate of 93.1\%, while keeping the poisoned text fluent and natural. The second attack, named Universal KPA (UKPA), exploits linguistic cues such as pronouns and dependency relations to disrupt the structural integrity of the generated graph by altering globally influential words. With fewer than 0.05\% of full text modified, the QA accuracy collapses from 95\% to 50\%. Furthermore, experiments show that state-of-the-art defense methods fail to detect these attacks, highlighting that securing GraphRAG pipelines against knowledge poisoning remains largely unexplored.

<title>Enhancing Vision-Language Model Training with Reinforcement Learning in Synthetic Worlds for Real-World Success</title>

Abstract: Interactive multimodal agents must convert raw visual observations into coherent sequences of language-conditioned actions -- a capability that current vision-language models (VLMs) still lack. Earlier reinforcement-learning (RL) efforts could, in principle, endow VLMs with such skills, but they have seldom tested whether the learned behaviours generalize beyond their training simulators, and they depend either on brittle hyperparameter tuning or on dense-reward environments with low state variability. We introduce Vision-Language Decoupled Actor-Critic (VL-DAC), a lightweight, hyperparameter-free RL algorithm. VL-DAC applies PPO updates to action tokens while learning value only at the environment-step level: an arrangement, to our knowledge, not previously explored for large VLMs or LLMs. This simple decoupling removes unstable weighting terms and yields faster, more reliable convergence. Training a single VLM with VL-DAC in one inexpensive simulator at a time (MiniWorld, Gym-Cards, ALFWorld, or WebShop) already produces policies that generalize widely: +50\% relative on BALROG (game-centric agentic control), +5\% relative on the hardest part of VSI-Bench (spatial planning), and +2\% on VisualWebBench (web navigation), all without degrading general image understanding accuracy. These results provide the first evidence that a simple RL algorithm can train VLMs entirely in cheap synthetic worlds while delivering measurable gains on real-image agentic, spatial-reasoning, and web-navigation benchmarks.

Abstract: Applying near-term variational quantum algorithms to the problem of dynamic satellite network routing represents a promising direction for quantum computing. In this work, we provide a critical evaluation of two major approaches: static quantum optimizers such as the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for offline route computation, and Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) methods for online decision-making. Using ideal, noise-free simulations, we find that these algorithms face significant challenges. Specifically, static optimizers are unable to solve even a classically easy 4-node shortest path problem due to the complexity of the optimization landscape. Likewise, a basic QRL agent based on policy gradient methods fails to learn a useful routing strategy in a dynamic 8-node environment and performs no better than random actions. These negative findings highlight key obstacles that must be addressed before quantum algorithms can offer real advantages in communication networks. We discuss the underlying causes of these limitations, including barren plateaus and learning instability, and suggest future research directions to overcome them.

Abstract: This study proposes NIRMAL (Novel Integrated Robust Multi-Adaptation Learning), a novel optimization algorithm that combines multiple strategies inspired by the movements of the chess piece. These strategies include gradient descent, momentum, stochastic perturbations, adaptive learning rates, and non-linear transformations. We carefully evaluated NIRMAL against two widely used and successful optimizers, Adam and SGD with Momentum, on four benchmark image classification datasets: MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100. The custom convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is applied on each dataset. The experimental results show that NIRMAL achieves competitive performance, particularly on the more challenging CIFAR-100 dataset, where it achieved a test accuracy of 45.32\%and a weighted F1-score of 0.4328. This performance surpasses Adam (41.79\% accuracy, 0.3964 F1-score) and closely matches SGD with Momentum (46.97\% accuracy, 0.4531 F1-score). Also, NIRMAL exhibits robust convergence and strong generalization capabilities, especially on complex datasets, as evidenced by stable training results in loss and accuracy curves. These findings underscore NIRMAL's significant ability as a versatile and effective optimizer for various deep learning tasks.

Abstract: We demonstrate that Principal Component Analysis (PCA), when applied in a structured manner, either to polar-transformed images or segment-wise to token sequences, enables extreme compression of neural models without sacrificing performance. Across three case studies, we show that a one-layer classifier trained on PCA-compressed polar MNIST achieves over 98 percent accuracy using only 840 parameters. A two-layer transformer trained on 70-dimensional PCA-reduced MiniLM embeddings reaches 76.62 percent accuracy on the 20 Newsgroups dataset with just 81000 parameters. A decoder-only transformer generates coherent token sequences from 70-dimensional PCA embeddings while preserving over 97 percent cosine similarity with full MiniLM representations, using less than 17 percent of the parameter count of GPT-2. These results highlight PCA-based input compression as a general and effective strategy for aligning model capacity with information content, enabling lightweight architectures across multiple modalities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show significant potential in healthcare, prompting numerous benchmarks to evaluate their capabilities. However, concerns persist regarding the reliability of these benchmarks, which often lack clinical fidelity, robust data management, and safety-oriented evaluation metrics. To address these shortcomings, we introduce MedCheck, the first lifecycle-oriented assessment framework specifically designed for medical benchmarks. Our framework deconstructs a benchmark's development into five continuous stages, from design to governance, and provides a comprehensive checklist of 46 medically-tailored criteria. Using MedCheck, we conducted an in-depth empirical evaluation of 53 medical LLM benchmarks. Our analysis uncovers widespread, systemic issues, including a profound disconnect from clinical practice, a crisis of data integrity due to unmitigated contamination risks, and a systematic neglect of safety-critical evaluation dimensions like model robustness and uncertainty awareness. Based on these findings, MedCheck serves as both a diagnostic tool for existing benchmarks and an actionable guideline to foster a more standardized, reliable, and transparent approach to evaluating AI in healthcare.

Abstract: Previous work has demonstrated that AI methods for analysing scientific literature benefit significantly from annotating sentences in papers according to their rhetorical roles, such as research gaps, results, limitations, extensions of existing methodologies, and others. Such representations also have the potential to support the development of a new generation of systems capable of producing high-quality literature reviews. However, achieving this goal requires the definition of a relevant annotation schema and effective strategies for large-scale annotation of the literature. This paper addresses these challenges by 1) introducing a novel annotation schema specifically designed to support literature review generation and 2) conducting a comprehensive evaluation of a wide range of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) in classifying rhetorical roles according to this schema. To this end, we also present Sci-Sentence, a novel multidisciplinary benchmark comprising 700 sentences manually annotated by domain experts and 2,240 sentences automatically labelled using LLMs. We evaluate 37 LLMs on this benchmark, spanning diverse model families and sizes, using both zero-shot learning and fine-tuning approaches. The experiments yield several novel insights that advance the state of the art in this challenging domain. First, the current generation of LLMs performs remarkably well on this task when fine-tuned on high-quality data, achieving performance levels above 96\% F1. Second, while large proprietary models like GPT-4o achieve the best results, some lightweight open-source alternatives also demonstrate excellent performance. Finally, enriching the training data with semi-synthetic examples generated by LLMs proves beneficial, enabling small encoders to achieve robust results and significantly enhancing the performance of several open decoder models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with algorithms like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) improves Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning, but is limited by a coarse-grained credit assignment that applies a uniform reward to all tokens in a sequence. This is a major flaw in long-chain reasoning tasks. This paper solves this with \textbf{Dynamic Entropy Weighting}. Our core idea is that high-entropy tokens in correct responses can guide the policy toward a higher performance ceiling. This allows us to create more fine-grained reward signals for precise policy updates via two ways: 1) \textbf{Group Token Policy Optimization} (\textbf{GTPO}), we assigns a entropy-weighted reward to each token for fine-grained credit assignment. 2) \textbf{Sequence-Level Group Relative Policy Optimization} (\textbf{GRPO-S}), we assigns a entropy-weighted reward to each sequence based on its average token entropy. Experiments show our methods significantly outperform the strong DAPO baseline. The results confirm that our entropy-weighting mechanism is the key driver of this performance boost, offering a better path to enhance deep reasoning in models.

Abstract: Reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) have substantially advanced through methods such as chain-of-thought and explicit step-by-step explanations. However, these improvements have not yet fully transitioned to multimodal contexts, where models must proactively decide which sensory modalities such as vision, audio, or spatial perception to engage when interacting with complex real-world environments. In this paper, we introduce the Chain of Questions (CoQ) framework, a curiosity-driven reasoning approach that encourages multimodal language models to dynamically generate targeted questions regarding their surroundings. These generated questions guide the model to selectively activate relevant modalities, thereby gathering critical information necessary for accurate reasoning and response generation. We evaluate our framework on a novel multimodal benchmark dataset, assembled by integrating WebGPT, ScienceQA, AVSD, and ScanQA datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our CoQ method improves a foundation model's ability to effectively identify and integrate pertinent sensory information. This leads to improved accuracy, interpretability, and alignment of the reasoning process with diverse multimodal tasks.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Learned User Significance Tracker (LUST), a framework designed to analyze video content and quantify the thematic relevance of its segments in relation to a user-provided textual description of significance. LUST leverages a multi-modal analytical pipeline, integrating visual cues from video frames with textual information extracted via Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) from the audio track. The core innovation lies in a hierarchical, two-stage relevance scoring mechanism employing Large Language Models (LLMs). An initial "direct relevance" score, $S_{d,i}$, assesses individual segments based on immediate visual and auditory content against the theme. This is followed by a "contextual relevance" score, $S_{c,i}$, that refines the assessment by incorporating the temporal progression of preceding thematic scores, allowing the model to understand evolving narratives. The LUST framework aims to provide a nuanced, temporally-aware measure of user-defined significance, outputting an annotated video with visualized relevance scores and comprehensive analytical logs.

Abstract: Ear biometrics offer a stable and contactless modality for identity recognition, yet their effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of annotated data and significant intra-class variability. Existing methods typically extract identity features from individual impressions in isolation, restricting their ability to capture consistent and discriminative representations. To overcome these limitations, a few-shot learning framework, ProtoN, is proposed to jointly process multiple impressions of an identity using a graph-based approach. Each impression is represented as a node in a class-specific graph, alongside a learnable prototype node that encodes identity-level information. This graph is processed by a Prototype Graph Neural Network (PGNN) layer, specifically designed to refine both impression and prototype representations through a dual-path message-passing mechanism. To further enhance discriminative power, the PGNN incorporates a cross-graph prototype alignment strategy that improves class separability by enforcing intra-class compactness while maintaining inter-class distinction. Additionally, a hybrid loss function is employed to balance episodic and global classification objectives, thereby improving the overall structure of the embedding space. Extensive experiments on five benchmark ear datasets demonstrate that ProtoN achieves state-of-the-art performance, with Rank-1 identification accuracy of up to 99.60% and an Equal Error Rate (EER) as low as 0.025, showing the effectiveness for few-shot ear recognition under limited data conditions.

Abstract: This study evaluates advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to enhance crash data quality by mining crash narratives, using secondary crash identification in Kentucky as a case study. Drawing from 16,656 manually reviewed narratives from 2015-2022, with 3,803 confirmed secondary crashes, we compare three model classes: zero-shot open-source large language models (LLMs) (LLaMA3:70B, DeepSeek-R1:70B, Qwen3:32B, Gemma3:27B); fine-tuned transformers (BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, Longformer); and traditional logistic regression as baseline. Models were calibrated on 2015-2021 data and tested on 1,771 narratives from 2022. Fine-tuned transformers achieved superior performance, with RoBERTa yielding the highest F1-score (0.90) and accuracy (95%). Zero-shot LLaMA3:70B reached a comparable F1 of 0.86 but required 139 minutes of inference; the logistic baseline lagged well behind (F1:0.66). LLMs excelled in recall for some variants (e.g., GEMMA3:27B at 0.94) but incurred high computational costs (up to 723 minutes for DeepSeek-R1:70B), while fine-tuned models processed the test set in seconds after brief training. Further analysis indicated that mid-sized LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1:32B) can rival larger counterparts in performance while reducing runtime, suggesting opportunities for optimized deployments. Results highlight trade-offs between accuracy, efficiency, and data requirements, with fine-tuned transformer models balancing precision and recall effectively on Kentucky data. Practical deployment considerations emphasize privacy-preserving local deployment, ensemble approaches for improved accuracy, and incremental processing for scalability, providing a replicable scheme for enhancing crash-data quality with advanced NLP.

Abstract: The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generative tasks has raised fundamental questions about the nature of their acquired capabilities, which often appear to emerge unexpectedly without explicit training. This paper examines the emergent properties of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) through both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, addressing the epistemological challenge of "creation without understanding" that characterises contemporary AI development. We explore how the neural approach's reliance on nonlinear, stochastic processes fundamentally differs from symbolic computational paradigms, creating systems whose macro-level behaviours cannot be analytically derived from micro-level neuron activities. Through analysis of scaling laws, grokking phenomena, and phase transitions in model capabilities, I demonstrate that emergent abilities arise from the complex dynamics of highly sensitive nonlinear systems rather than simply from parameter scaling alone. My investigation reveals that current debates over metrics, pre-training loss thresholds, and in-context learning miss the fundamental ontological nature of emergence in DNNs. I argue that these systems exhibit genuine emergent properties analogous to those found in other complex natural phenomena, where systemic capabilities emerge from cooperative interactions among simple components without being reducible to their individual behaviours. The paper concludes that understanding LLM capabilities requires recognising DNNs as a new domain of complex dynamical systems governed by universal principles of emergence, similar to those operating in physics, chemistry, and biology. This perspective shifts the focus from purely phenomenological definitions of emergence to understanding the internal dynamic transformations that enable these systems to acquire capabilities that transcend their individual components.

Abstract: Renovating existing buildings is essential for climate impact. Early-phase renovation planning requires simulations based on thermal 3D models at Level of Detail (LoD) 3, which include features like windows. However, scalable and accurate identification of such features remains a challenge. This paper presents the Scalable Image-to-3D Facade Parser (SI3FP), a pipeline that generates LoD3 thermal models by extracting geometries from images using both computer vision and deep learning. Unlike existing methods relying on segmentation and projection, SI3FP directly models geometric primitives in the orthographic image plane, providing a unified interface while reducing perspective distortions. SI3FP supports both sparse (e.g., Google Street View) and dense (e.g., hand-held camera) data sources. Tested on typical Swedish residential buildings, SI3FP achieved approximately 5% error in window-to-wall ratio estimates, demonstrating sufficient accuracy for early-stage renovation analysis. The pipeline facilitates large-scale energy renovation planning and has broader applications in urban development and planning.

Abstract: Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) aims to segment target objects in audible videos based on given reference expressions. Prior works typically rely on learning latent embeddings via multimodal fusion to prompt a tunable SAM/SAM2 decoder for segmentation, which requires strong pixel-level supervision and lacks interpretability. From a novel perspective of explicit reference understanding, we propose TGS-Agent, which decomposes the task into a Think-Ground-Segment process, mimicking the human reasoning procedure by first identifying the referred object through multimodal analysis, followed by coarse-grained grounding and precise segmentation. To this end, we first propose Ref-Thinker, a multimodal language model capable of reasoning over textual, visual, and auditory cues. We construct an instruction-tuning dataset with explicit object-aware think-answer chains for Ref-Thinker fine-tuning. The object description inferred by Ref-Thinker is used as an explicit prompt for Grounding-DINO and SAM2, which perform grounding and segmentation without relying on pixel-level supervision. Additionally, we introduce R\textsuperscript{2}-AVSBench, a new benchmark with linguistically diverse and reasoning-intensive references for better evaluating model generalization. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on both standard Ref-AVSBench and proposed R\textsuperscript{2}-AVSBench. Code will be available at https://github.com/jasongief/TGS-Agent.

<title>Decoding the Multimodal Maze: A Systematic Review on the Adoption of Explainability in Multimodal Attention-based Models</title>

Abstract: Multimodal learning has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years, particularly with the integration of attention-based models, leading to significant performance gains across a variety of tasks. Parallel to this progress, the demand for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has spurred a growing body of research aimed at interpreting the complex decision-making processes of these models. This systematic literature review analyzes research published between January 2020 and early 2024 that focuses on the explainability of multimodal models. Framed within the broader goals of XAI, we examine the literature across multiple dimensions, including model architecture, modalities involved, explanation algorithms and evaluation methodologies. Our analysis reveals that the majority of studies are concentrated on vision-language and language-only models, with attention-based techniques being the most commonly employed for explanation. However, these methods often fall short in capturing the full spectrum of interactions between modalities, a challenge further compounded by the architectural heterogeneity across domains. Importantly, we find that evaluation methods for XAI in multimodal settings are largely non-systematic, lacking consistency, robustness, and consideration for modality-specific cognitive and contextual factors. Based on these findings, we provide a comprehensive set of recommendations aimed at promoting rigorous, transparent, and standardized evaluation and reporting practices in multimodal XAI research. Our goal is to support future research in more interpretable, accountable, and responsible mulitmodal AI systems, with explainability at their core.

<title>StepFun-Formalizer: Unlocking the Autoformalization Potential of LLMs through Knowledge-Reasoning Fusion</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04440</link>

Abstract: Autoformalization aims to translate natural-language mathematical statements into a formal language. While LLMs have accelerated progress in this area, existing methods still suffer from low accuracy. We identify two key abilities for effective autoformalization: comprehensive mastery of formal-language domain knowledge, and reasoning capability of natural language problem understanding and informal-formal alignment. Without the former, a model cannot identify the correct formal objects; without the latter, it struggles to interpret real-world contexts and map them precisely into formal expressions. To address these gaps, we introduce ThinkingF, a data synthesis and training pipeline that improves both abilities. First, we construct two datasets: one by distilling and selecting large-scale examples rich in formal knowledge, and another by generating informal-to-formal reasoning trajectories guided by expert-designed templates. We then apply SFT and RLVR with these datasets to further fuse and refine the two abilities. The resulting 7B and 32B models exhibit both comprehensive formal knowledge and strong informal-to-formal reasoning. Notably, StepFun-Formalizer-32B achieves SOTA BEq@1 scores of 40.5% on FormalMATH-Lite and 26.7% on ProverBench, surpassing all prior general-purpose and specialized models.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for scalable and high-quality educational assessment tools within the Malaysian education system. It highlights the potential of Generative AI (GenAI) while acknowledging the significant challenges of ensuring factual accuracy and curriculum alignment, especially for low-resource languages like Bahasa Melayu. This research introduces and compares four incremental pipelines for generating Form 1 Mathematics multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Bahasa Melayu using OpenAI's GPT-4o. The methods range from non-grounded prompting (structured and basic) to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches (one using the LangChain framework, one implemented manually). The system is grounded in official curriculum documents, including teacher-prepared notes and the yearly teaching plan (RPT). A dual-pronged automated evaluation framework is employed to assess the generated questions. Curriculum alignment is measured using Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) against the RPT, while contextual validity is verified through a novel RAG-based Question-Answering (RAG-QA) method. The results demonstrate that RAG-based pipelines significantly outperform non-grounded prompting methods, producing questions with higher curriculum alignment and factual validity. The study further analyzes the trade-offs between the ease of implementation of framework-based RAG and the fine-grained control offered by a manual pipeline. This work presents a validated methodology for generating curriculum-specific educational content in a low-resource language, introduces a symbiotic RAG-QA evaluation technique, and provides actionable insights for the development and deployment of practical EdTech solutions in Malaysia and similar regions.

<title>Cloud Model Characteristic Function Auto-Encoder: Integrating Cloud Model Theory with MMD Regularization for Enhanced Generative Modeling</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04447</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: We introduce Cloud Model Characteristic Function Auto-Encoder (CMCFAE), a novel generative model that integrates the cloud model into the Wasserstein Auto-Encoder (WAE) framework. By leveraging the characteristic functions of the cloud model to regularize the latent space, our approach enables more accurate modeling of complex data distributions. Unlike conventional methods that rely on a standard Gaussian prior and traditional divergence measures, our method employs a cloud model prior, providing a more flexible and realistic representation of the latent space, thus mitigating the homogenization observed in reconstructed samples. We derive the characteristic function of the cloud model and propose a corresponding regularizer within the WAE framework. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA demonstrate that CMCFAE outperforms existing models in terms of reconstruction quality, latent space structuring, and sample diversity. This work not only establishes a novel integration of cloud model theory with MMD-based regularization but also offers a promising new perspective for enhancing autoencoder-based generative models.

Abstract: Red teaming is critical for identifying vulnerabilities and building trust in current LLMs. However, current automated methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on brittle prompt templates or single-turn attacks, failing to capture the complex, interactive nature of real-world adversarial dialogues. We propose a novel paradigm: training an AI to strategically `break' another AI. By formalizing red teaming as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employing a hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, we effectively address the inherent sparse reward and long-horizon challenges. Our generative agent learns coherent, multi-turn attack strategies through a fine-grained, token-level harm reward, enabling it to uncover subtle vulnerabilities missed by existing baselines. This approach sets a new state-of-the-art, fundamentally reframing LLM red teaming as a dynamic, trajectory-based process (rather than a one-step test) essential for robust AI deployment.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.04461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid progress seen in terms of large-scale generative AI is largely based on the attention mechanism. It is conversely non-trivial to conceive small-scale applications for which attention-based architectures outperform traditional approaches, such as multi-layer perceptrons or recurrent networks. We examine this problem in the context of 'task switching'. In this framework models work on ongoing token sequences with the current task being determined by stochastically interspersed control tokens. We show that standard transformers cannot solve a basic task switching reference model based on finite domain arithmetics which contains subtasks dedicated to increment / addition / reverse copy / context (IARC). We show that transformers, long short-term memory recurrent networks (LSTM), and plain multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) achieve similar, but only modest prediction accuracies. We enlarge our comparative study by including an extension of the standard transformer architecture to its non-translational invariant counterpart, the cisformer, and an alternative attention mechanism, extensive attention. A combination of the latter is found to be the only model able to achieve considerable performance levels, of around 95%. Our results indicate that the workings of attention can be understood better, and even improved, when comparing qualitatively different formulations in task-switching settings.

<title>Zero-Residual Concept Erasure via Progressive Alignment in Text-to-Image Model</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04472</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.04472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concept Erasure, which aims to prevent pretrained text-to-image models from generating content associated with semantic-harmful concepts (i.e., target concepts), is getting increased attention. State-of-the-art methods formulate this task as an optimization problem: they align all target concepts with semantic-harmless anchor concepts, and apply closed-form solutions to update the model accordingly. While these closed-form methods are efficient, we argue that existing methods have two overlooked limitations: 1) They often result in incomplete erasure due to "non-zero alignment residual", especially when text prompts are relatively complex. 2) They may suffer from generation quality degradation as they always concentrate parameter updates in a few deep layers. To address these issues, we propose a novel closed-form method ErasePro: it is designed for more complete concept erasure and better preserving overall generative quality. Specifically, ErasePro first introduces a strict zero-residual constraint into the optimization objective, ensuring perfect alignment between target and anchor concept features and enabling more complete erasure. Secondly, it employs a progressive, layer-wise update strategy that gradually transfers target concept features to those of the anchor concept from shallow to deep layers. As the depth increases, the required parameter changes diminish, thereby reducing deviations in sensitive deep layers and preserving generative quality. Empirical results across different concept erasure tasks (including instance, art style, and nudity erasure) have demonstrated the effectiveness of our ErasePro.

Abstract: Metric learning from a set of triplet comparisons in the form of "Do you think item h is more similar to item i or item j?", indicating similarity and differences between items, plays a key role in various applications including image retrieval, recommendation systems, and cognitive psychology. The goal is to learn a metric in the RKHS that reflects the comparisons. Nonlinear metric learning using kernel methods and neural networks have shown great empirical promise. While previous works have addressed certain aspects of this problem, there is little or no theoretical understanding of such methods. The exception is the special (linear) case in which the RKHS is the standard Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$; there is a comprehensive theory for metric learning in $\mathbb{R}^d$. This paper develops a general RKHS framework for metric learning and provides novel generalization guarantees and sample complexity bounds. We validate our findings through a set of simulations and experiments on real datasets. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/RamyaLab/metric-learning-RKHS.

Abstract: In this study, we evaluate the performance of classical and quantum-inspired sequential models in forecasting univariate time series of incoming SMS activity (SMS-in) using the Milan Telecommunication Activity Dataset. Due to data completeness limitations, we focus exclusively on the SMS-in signal for each spatial grid cell. We compare five models, LSTM (baseline), Quantum LSTM (QLSTM), Quantum Adaptive Self-Attention (QASA), Quantum Receptance Weighted Key-Value (QRWKV), and Quantum Fast Weight Programmers (QFWP), under varying input sequence lengths (4, 8, 12, 16, 32 and 64). All models are trained to predict the next 10-minute SMS-in value based solely on historical values within a given sequence window. Our findings indicate that different models exhibit varying sensitivities to sequence length, suggesting that quantum enhancements are not universally advantageous. Rather, the effectiveness of quantum modules is highly dependent on the specific task and architectural design, reflecting inherent trade-offs among model size, parameterization strategies, and temporal modeling capabilities.

<title>Hierarchical Scoring for Machine Learning Classifier Error Impact Evaluation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: A common use of machine learning (ML) models is predicting the class of a sample. Object detection is an extension of classification that includes localization of the object via a bounding box within the sample. Classification, and by extension object detection, is typically evaluated by counting a prediction as incorrect if the predicted label does not match the ground truth label. This pass/fail scoring treats all misclassifications as equivalent. In many cases, class labels can be organized into a class taxonomy with a hierarchical structure to either reflect relationships among the data or operator valuation of misclassifications. When such a hierarchical structure exists, hierarchical scoring metrics can return the model performance of a given prediction related to the distance between the prediction and the ground truth label. Such metrics can be viewed as giving partial credit to predictions instead of pass/fail, enabling a finer-grained understanding of the impact of misclassifications. This work develops hierarchical scoring metrics varying in complexity that utilize scoring trees to encode relationships between class labels and produce metrics that reflect distance in the scoring tree. The scoring metrics are demonstrated on an abstract use case with scoring trees that represent three weighting strategies and evaluated by the kind of errors discouraged. Results demonstrate that these metrics capture errors with finer granularity and the scoring trees enable tuning. This work demonstrates an approach to evaluating ML performance that ranks models not only by how many errors are made but by the kind or impact of errors. Python implementations of the scoring metrics will be available in an open-source repository at time of publication.

Abstract: Causal representation learning has attracted significant research interest during the past few years, as a means for improving model generalization and robustness. Causal representations of interventional image pairs, have the property that only variables corresponding to scene elements affected by the intervention / action are changed between the start state and the end state. While most work in this area has focused on identifying and representing the variables of the scene under a causal model, fewer efforts have focused on representations of the interventions themselves. In this work, we show that an effective strategy for improving out of distribution (OOD) robustness is to focus on the representation of interventions in the latent space. Specifically, we propose that an intervention can be represented by a Causal Delta Embedding that is invariant to the visual scene and sparse in terms of the causal variables it affects. Leveraging this insight, we propose a framework that is capable of learning causal representations from image pairs, without any additional supervision. Experiments in the Causal Triplet challenge demonstrate that Causal Delta Embeddings are highly effective in OOD settings, significantly exceeding baseline performance in both synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

Abstract: Multivariate time-series classification is pivotal in domains ranging from wearable sensing to biomedical monitoring. Despite recent advances, Transformer- and CNN-based models often remain computationally heavy, offer limited frequency diversity, and require extensive parameter budgets. We propose PRISM (Per-channel Resolution-Informed Symmetric Module), a convolutional-based feature extractor that applies symmetric finite-impulse-response (FIR) filters at multiple temporal scales, independently per channel. This multi-resolution, per-channel design yields highly frequency-selective embeddings without any inter-channel convolutions, greatly reducing model size and complexity. Across human-activity, sleep-stage and biomedical benchmarks, PRISM, paired with lightweight classification heads, matches or outperforms leading CNN and Transformer baselines, while using roughly an order of magnitude fewer parameters and FLOPs. By uniting classical signal processing insights with modern deep learning, PRISM offers an accurate, resource-efficient solution for multivariate time-series classification.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-generation models has enabled the creation of hyperrealistic imagery, posing ethical risks through widespread misinformation. Current deepfake detection methods, categorized as face specific detectors or general AI-generated detectors, lack transparency by framing detection as a classification task without explaining decisions. While several LLM-based approaches offer explainability, they suffer from coarse-grained analyses and dependency on labor-intensive annotations. This paper introduces RAIDX (Retrieval-Augmented Image Deepfake Detection and Explainability), a novel deepfake detection framework integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance detection accuracy and decision explainability. Specifically, RAIDX leverages RAG to incorporate external knowledge for improved detection accuracy and employs GRPO to autonomously generate fine-grained textual explanations and saliency maps, eliminating the need for extensive manual annotations. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate RAIDX's effectiveness in identifying real or fake, and providing interpretable rationales in both textual descriptions and saliency maps, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance while advancing transparency in deepfake identification. RAIDX represents the first unified framework to synergize RAG and GRPO, addressing critical gaps in accuracy and explainability. Our code and models will be publicly available.

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental disorder that affects millions worldwide. While automated depression assessment shows promise, most studies rely on limited or non-clinically validated data, and often prioritize complex model design over real-world effectiveness. In this paper, we aim to unveil the landscape of clinical depression assessment. We introduce C-MIND, a clinical neuropsychiatric multimodal diagnosis dataset collected over two years from real hospital visits. Each participant completes three structured psychiatric tasks and receives a final diagnosis from expert clinicians, with informative audio, video, transcript, and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals recorded. Using C-MIND, we first analyze behavioral signatures relevant to diagnosis. We train a range of classical models to quantify how different tasks and modalities contribute to diagnostic performance, and dissect the effectiveness of their combinations. We then explore whether LLMs can perform psychiatric reasoning like clinicians and identify their clear limitations in realistic clinical settings. In response, we propose to guide the reasoning process with clinical expertise and consistently improves LLM diagnostic performance by up to 10% in Macro-F1 score. We aim to build an infrastructure for clinical depression assessment from both data and algorithmic perspectives, enabling C-MIND to facilitate grounded and reliable research for mental healthcare.

Abstract: Marine videos present significant challenges for video understanding due to the dynamics of marine objects and the surrounding environment, camera motion, and the complexity of underwater scenes. Existing video captioning datasets, typically focused on generic or human-centric domains, often fail to generalize to the complexities of the marine environment and gain insights about marine life. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage marine object-oriented video captioning pipeline. We introduce a comprehensive video understanding benchmark that leverages the triplets of video, text, and segmentation masks to facilitate visual grounding and captioning, leading to improved marine video understanding and analysis, and marine video generation. Additionally, we highlight the effectiveness of video splitting in order to detect salient object transitions in scene changes, which significantly enrich the semantics of captioning content. Our dataset and code have been released at https://msc.hkustvgd.com.

Abstract: The Dense Audio-Visual Event Localization (DAVEL) task aims to temporally localize events in untrimmed videos that occur simultaneously in both the audio and visual modalities. This paper explores DAVEL under a new and more challenging weakly-supervised setting (W-DAVEL task), where only video-level event labels are provided and the temporal boundaries of each event are unknown. We address W-DAVEL by exploiting \textit{cross-modal salient anchors}, which are defined as reliable timestamps that are well predicted under weak supervision and exhibit highly consistent event semantics across audio and visual modalities. Specifically, we propose a \textit{Mutual Event Agreement Evaluation} module, which generates an agreement score by measuring the discrepancy between the predicted audio and visual event classes. Then, the agreement score is utilized in a \textit{Cross-modal Salient Anchor Identification} module, which identifies the audio and visual anchor features through global-video and local temporal window identification mechanisms. The anchor features after multimodal integration are fed into an \textit{Anchor-based Temporal Propagation} module to enhance event semantic encoding in the original temporal audio and visual features, facilitating better temporal localization under weak supervision. We establish benchmarks for W-DAVEL on both the UnAV-100 and ActivityNet1.3 datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: While AI agents show potential in scientific ideation, most existing frameworks rely on single-agent refinement, limiting creativity due to bounded knowledge and perspective. Inspired by real-world research dynamics, this paper investigates whether structured multi-agent discussions can surpass solitary ideation. We propose a cooperative multi-agent framework for generating research proposals and systematically compare configurations including group size, leaderled versus leaderless structures, and team compositions varying in interdisciplinarity and seniority. To assess idea quality, we employ a comprehensive protocol with agent-based scoring and human review across dimensions such as novelty, strategic vision, and integration depth. Our results show that multi-agent discussions substantially outperform solitary baselines. A designated leader acts as a catalyst, transforming discussion into more integrated and visionary proposals. Notably, we find that cognitive diversity is a primary driver of quality, yet expertise is a non-negotiable prerequisite, as teams lacking a foundation of senior knowledge fail to surpass even a single competent agent. These findings offer actionable insights for designing collaborative AI ideation systems and shed light on how team structure influences creative outcomes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their high computational and memory demands hinder their widespread deployment. Existing compression techniques focus on intra-block optimizations (e.g. low-rank approximation, attention head pruning), while the repetitive layered structure of transformers implies significant inter-block redundancy - a dimension largely unexplored beyond key-value (KV) caching. Inspired by dictionary learning in CNNs, we propose a framework for structured weight sharing across transformer layers. Our approach decomposes attention projection matrices into shared dictionary atoms, reducing the attention module's parameters by 66.7% while achieving on-par performance. Unlike complex methods requiring distillation or architectural changes, MASA (Matrix Atom Sharing in Attention) operates as a drop-in replacement - trained with standard optimizers - and represents each layer's weights as linear combinations of shared matrix atoms. Experiments across scales (100M-700M parameters) show that MASA achieves better benchmark accuracy and perplexity than grouped-query attention (GQA), low-rank baselines and recently proposed Repeat-all-over/Sequential sharing at comparable parameter budgets. Ablation studies confirm robustness to the dictionary size and the efficacy of shared representations in capturing cross-layer statistical regularities. Extending to Vision Transformers (ViT), MASA matches performance metrics on image classification and detection tasks with 66.7% fewer attention parameters. By combining dictionary learning strategies with transformer efficiency, MASA offers a scalable blueprint for parameter-efficient models without sacrificing performance. Finally, we investigate the possibility of employing MASA on pretrained LLMs to reduce their number of parameters without experiencing any significant drop in their performance.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) conferences are essential for advancing research, sharing knowledge, and fostering academic community. However, their rapid expansion has rendered the centralized conference model increasingly unsustainable. This paper offers a data-driven diagnosis of a structural crisis that threatens the foundational goals of scientific dissemination, equity, and community well-being. We identify four key areas of strain: (1) scientifically, with per-author publication rates more than doubling over the past decade to over 4.5 papers annually; (2) environmentally, with the carbon footprint of a single conference exceeding the daily emissions of its host city; (3) psychologically, with 71% of online community discourse reflecting negative sentiment and 35% referencing mental health concerns; and (4) logistically, with attendance at top conferences such as NeurIPS 2024 beginning to outpace venue capacity. These pressures point to a system that is misaligned with its core mission. In response, we propose the Community-Federated Conference (CFC) model, which separates peer review, presentation, and networking into globally coordinated but locally organized components, offering a more sustainable, inclusive, and resilient path forward for AI research.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) parameters from diffusion-weighted MRI remains challenging due to the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem and high sensitivity to noise, particularly in the perfusion compartment. In this work, we propose a probabilistic deep learning framework based on Deep Ensembles (DE) of Mixture Density Networks (MDNs), enabling estimation of total predictive uncertainty and decomposition into aleatoric (AU) and epistemic (EU) components. The method was benchmarked against non probabilistic neural networks, a Bayesian fitting approach and a probabilistic network with single Gaussian parametrization. Supervised training was performed on synthetic data, and evaluation was conducted on both simulated and two in vivo datasets. The reliability of the quantified uncertainties was assessed using calibration curves, output distribution sharpness, and the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS). MDNs produced more calibrated and sharper predictive distributions for the D and f parameters, although slight overconfidence was observed in D*. The Robust Coefficient of Variation (RCV) indicated smoother in vivo estimates for D* with MDNs compared to Gaussian model. Despite the training data covering the expected physiological range, elevated EU in vivo suggests a mismatch with real acquisition conditions, highlighting the importance of incorporating EU, which was allowed by DE. Overall, we present a comprehensive framework for IVIM fitting with uncertainty quantification, which enables the identification and interpretation of unreliable estimates. The proposed approach can also be adopted for fitting other physical models through appropriate architectural and simulation adjustments.

<title>GraphProp: Training the Graph Foundation Models using Graph Properties</title>

Abstract: This work focuses on training graph foundation models (GFMs) that have strong generalization ability in graph-level tasks such as graph classification. Effective GFM training requires capturing information consistent across different domains. We discover that graph structures provide more consistent cross-domain information compared to node features and graph labels. However, traditional GFMs primarily focus on transferring node features from various domains into a unified representation space but often lack structural cross-domain generalization. To address this, we introduce GraphProp, which emphasizes structural generalization. The training process of GraphProp consists of two main phases. First, we train a structural GFM by predicting graph invariants. Since graph invariants are properties of graphs that depend only on the abstract structure, not on particular labellings or drawings of the graph, this structural GFM has a strong ability to capture the abstract structural information and provide discriminative graph representations comparable across diverse domains. In the second phase, we use the representations given by the structural GFM as positional encodings to train a comprehensive GFM. This phase utilizes domain-specific node attributes and graph labels to further improve cross-domain node feature generalization. Our experiments demonstrate that GraphProp significantly outperforms the competitors in supervised learning and few-shot learning, especially in handling graphs without node attributes.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) is transforming search engines into conversational AI search products, primarily using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on web corpora. However, this paradigm has significant industrial limitations. Traditional RAG approaches struggle with real-time needs and structured queries that require accessing dynamically generated content like ticket availability or inventory. Limited to indexing static pages, search engines cannot perform the interactive queries needed for such time-sensitive data. Academic research has focused on optimizing RAG for static content, overlooking complex intents and the need for dynamic sources like databases and real-time APIs. To bridge this gap, we introduce TURA (Tool-Augmented Unified Retrieval Agent for AI Search), a novel three-stage framework that combines RAG with agentic tool-use to access both static content and dynamic, real-time information. TURA has three key components: an Intent-Aware Retrieval module to decompose queries and retrieve information sources encapsulated as Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers, a DAG-based Task Planner that models task dependencies as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for optimal parallel execution, and a lightweight Distilled Agent Executor for efficient tool calling. TURA is the first architecture to systematically bridge the gap between static RAG and dynamic information sources for a world-class AI search product. Serving tens of millions of users, it leverages an agentic framework to deliver robust, real-time answers while meeting the low-latency demands of a large-scale industrial system.

Abstract: Inspired by the brain's hierarchical processing and energy efficiency, this paper presents a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) architecture for lifelong Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). The proposed system first employs an efficient static SNN to identify potential intrusions, which then activates an adaptive dynamic SNN responsible for classifying the specific attack type. Mimicking biological adaptation, the dynamic classifier utilizes Grow When Required (GWR)-inspired structural plasticity and a novel Adaptive Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (Ad-STDP) learning rule. These bio-plausible mechanisms enable the network to learn new threats incrementally while preserving existing knowledge. Tested on the UNSW-NB15 benchmark in a continual learning setting, the architecture demonstrates robust adaptation, reduced catastrophic forgetting, and achieves $85.3$\% overall accuracy. Furthermore, simulations using the Intel Lava framework confirm high operational sparsity, highlighting the potential for low-power deployment on neuromorphic hardware.

<title>HiD-VAE: Interpretable Generative Recommendation via Hierarchical and Disentangled Semantic IDs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04618</link>

Abstract: Recommender systems are indispensable for helping users navigate the immense item catalogs of modern online platforms. Recently, generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm, unifying the conventional retrieve-and-rank pipeline into an end-to-end model capable of dynamic generation. However, existing generative methods are fundamentally constrained by their unsupervised tokenization, which generates semantic IDs suffering from two critical flaws: (1) they are semantically flat and uninterpretable, lacking a coherent hierarchy, and (2) they are prone to representation entanglement (i.e., ``ID collisions''), which harms recommendation accuracy and diversity. To overcome these limitations, we propose HiD-VAE, a novel framework that learns hierarchically disentangled item representations through two core innovations. First, HiD-VAE pioneers a hierarchically-supervised quantization process that aligns discrete codes with multi-level item tags, yielding more uniform and disentangled IDs. Crucially, the trained codebooks can predict hierarchical tags, providing a traceable and interpretable semantic path for each recommendation. Second, to combat representation entanglement, HiD-VAE incorporates a novel uniqueness loss that directly penalizes latent space overlap. This mechanism not only resolves the critical ID collision problem but also promotes recommendation diversity by ensuring a more comprehensive utilization of the item representation space. These high-quality, disentangled IDs provide a powerful foundation for downstream generative models. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks validate HiD-VAE's superior performance against state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HiD-VAE-84B2.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to produce safe, helpful, and honest content during interaction with human users, but they frequently fail to align with such values when given flawed instructions, e.g., missing context, ambiguous directives, or inappropriate tone, leaving substantial room for improvement along multiple dimensions. A cost-effective yet high-impact way is to pre-align instructions before the model begins decoding. Existing approaches either rely on prohibitive test-time search costs or end-to-end model rewrite, which is powered by a customized training corpus with unclear objectives. In this work, we demonstrate that the goal of efficient and effective preference alignment can be achieved by P-Aligner, a lightweight module generating instructions that preserve the original intents while being expressed in a more human-preferred form. P-Aligner is trained on UltraPrompt, a new dataset synthesized via a proposed principle-guided pipeline using Monte-Carlo Tree Search, which systematically explores the space of candidate instructions that are closely tied to human preference. Experiments across different methods show that P-Aligner generally outperforms strong baselines across various models and benchmarks, including average win-rate gains of 28.35% and 8.69% on GPT-4-turbo and Gemma-2-SimPO, respectively. Further analyses validate its effectiveness and efficiency through multiple perspectives, including data quality, search strategies, iterative deployment, and time overhead.

Abstract: Link Prediction (LP) is a critical task in graph machine learning. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly advanced LP performance recently, existing methods face key challenges including limited supervision from sparse connectivity, sensitivity to initialization, and poor generalization under distribution shifts. We explore pretraining as a solution to address these challenges. Unlike node classification, LP is inherently a pairwise task, which requires the integration of both node- and edge-level information. In this work, we present the first systematic study on the transferability of these distinct modules and propose a late fusion strategy to effectively combine their outputs for improved performance. To handle the diversity of pretraining data and avoid negative transfer, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that captures distinct patterns in separate experts, facilitating seamless application of the pretrained model on diverse downstream datasets. For fast adaptation, we develop a parameter-efficient tuning strategy that allows the pretrained model to adapt to unseen datasets with minimal computational overhead. Experiments on 16 datasets across two domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance on low-resource link prediction while obtaining competitive results compared to end-to-end trained methods, with over 10,000x lower computational overhead.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in broad knowledge representation, yet they are inherently deficient in pixel-level perceptual understanding. Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents a significant advancement in visual-prompt-driven image segmentation, it exhibits notable limitations in multi-mask prediction and category-specific segmentation tasks, and it cannot integrate all segmentation tasks within a unified model architecture. To address these limitations, we present X-SAM, a streamlined Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework that extends the segmentation paradigm from \textit{segment anything} to \textit{any segmentation}. Specifically, we introduce a novel unified framework that enables more advanced pixel-level perceptual comprehension for MLLMs. Furthermore, we propose a new segmentation task, termed Visual GrounDed (VGD) segmentation, which segments all instance objects with interactive visual prompts and empowers MLLMs with visual grounded, pixel-wise interpretative capabilities. To enable effective training on diverse data sources, we present a unified training strategy that supports co-training across multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that X-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of image segmentation benchmarks, highlighting its efficiency for multimodal, pixel-level visual understanding.

Using YOLO v8 a deep learning model for real-time object recognition. This study suggests an AI based approach, by developing a system that analyzes high resolution chicken photos, YOLO v8 detects signs of illness, such as abnormalities in behavior and appearance. A sizable, annotated dataset has been used to train the algorithm, which provides accurate real-time identification of infected chicken and prompt warnings to farm operators for prompt action. By facilitating early infection identification, eliminating the need for human inspection, and enhancing biosecurity in large-scale farms, this AI technology improves chicken health management. The real-time features of YOLO v8 provide a scalable and effective method for improving farm management techniques.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) achieve remarkable quality, yet their massive parameter scale (8-11B) poses significant challenges for inferences on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present HierarchicalPrune, a novel compression framework grounded in a key observation: DM blocks exhibit distinct functional hierarchies, where early blocks establish semantic structures while later blocks handle texture refinements. HierarchicalPrune synergistically combines three techniques: (1) Hierarchical Position Pruning, which identifies and removes less essential later blocks based on position hierarchy; (2) Positional Weight Preservation, which systematically protects early model portions that are essential for semantic structural integrity; and (3) Sensitivity-Guided Distillation, which adjusts knowledge-transfer intensity based on our discovery of block-wise sensitivity variations. As a result, our framework brings billion-scale diffusion models into a range more suitable for on-device inference, while preserving the quality of the output images. Specifically, when combined with INT4 weight quantisation, HierarchicalPrune achieves 77.5-80.4% memory footprint reduction (e.g., from 15.8 GB to 3.2 GB) and 27.9-38.0% latency reduction, measured on server and consumer grade GPUs, with the minimum drop of 2.6% in GenEval score and 7% in HPSv2 score compared to the original model. Last but not least, our comprehensive user study with 85 participants demonstrates that HierarchicalPrune maintains perceptual quality comparable to the original model while significantly outperforming prior works.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from significant performance degradation when processing long contexts due to proactive interference, where irrelevant information in earlier parts of the context disrupts reasoning and memory recall. While most research focuses on external memory systems to augment LLMs' capabilities, we propose a complementary approach: empowering LLMs with Active Context Management (ACM) tools to actively sculpt their internal working memory. We introduce Sculptor, a framework that equips LLMs with three categories of tools: (1) context fragmentation, (2) summary, hide, and restore, and (3) intelligent search. Our approach enables LLMs to proactively manage their attention and working memory, analogous to how humans selectively focus on relevant information while filtering out distractions. Experimental evaluation on information-sparse benchmarks-PI-LLM (proactive interference) and NeedleBench Multi-Needle Reasoning-demonstrates that Sculptor significantly improves performance even without specific training, leveraging LLMs' inherent tool calling generalization capabilities. By enabling Active Context Management, Sculptor not only mitigates proactive interference but also provides a cognitive foundation for more reliable reasoning across diverse long-context tasks-highlighting that explicit context-control strategies, rather than merely larger token windows, are key to robustness at scale.

Abstract: The continual learning capability of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for advancing artificial general intelligence. However, continual fine-tuning LLMs across various domains often suffers from catastrophic forgetting, characterized by: 1) significant forgetting of their general capabilities, and 2) sharp performance declines in previously learned tasks. To simultaneously address both issues in a simple yet stable manner, we propose General Sample Replay (GeRe), a framework that use usual pretraining texts for efficient anti-forgetting. Beyond revisiting the most prevalent replay-based practices under GeRe, we further leverage neural states to introduce a enhanced activation states constrained optimization method using threshold-based margin (TM) loss, which maintains activation state consistency during replay learning. We are the first to validate that a small, fixed set of pre-collected general replay samples is sufficient to resolve both concerns--retaining general capabilities while promoting overall performance across sequential tasks. Indeed, the former can inherently facilitate the latter. Through controlled experiments, we systematically compare TM with different replay strategies under the GeRe framework, including vanilla label fitting, logit imitation via KL divergence and feature imitation via L1/L2 losses. Results demonstrate that TM consistently improves performance and exhibits better robustness. Our work paves the way for efficient replay of LLMs for the future. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Qznan/GeRe.

Abstract: This study introduces Query Attribute Modeling (QAM), a hybrid framework that enhances search precision and relevance by decomposing open text queries into structured metadata tags and semantic elements. QAM addresses traditional search limitations by automatically extracting metadata filters from free-form text queries, reducing noise and enabling focused retrieval of relevant items.
  Experimental evaluation using the Amazon Toys Reviews dataset (10,000 unique items with 40,000+ reviews and detailed product attributes) demonstrated QAM's superior performance, achieving a mean average precision at 5 (mAP@5) of 52.99\%. This represents significant improvement over conventional methods, including BM25 keyword search, encoder-based semantic similarity search, cross-encoder re-ranking, and hybrid search combining BM25 and semantic results via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). The results establish QAM as a robust solution for Enterprise Search applications, particularly in e-commerce systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent robotic systems (MARS) build upon multi-agent systems by integrating physical and task-related constraints, increasing the complexity of action execution and agent coordination. However, despite the availability of advanced multi-agent frameworks, their real-world deployment on robots remains limited, hindering the advancement of MARS research in practice. To bridge this gap, we conducted two studies to investigate performance trade-offs of hierarchical multi-agent frameworks in a simulated real-world multi-robot healthcare scenario. In Study 1, using CrewAI, we iteratively refine the system's knowledge base, to systematically identify and categorize coordination failures (e.g., tool access violations, lack of timely handling of failure reports) not resolvable by providing contextual knowledge alone. In Study 2, using AutoGen, we evaluate a redesigned bidirectional communication structure and further measure the trade-offs between reasoning and non-reasoning models operating within the same robotic team setting. Drawing from our empirical findings, we emphasize the tension between autonomy and stability and the importance of edge-case testing to improve system reliability and safety for future real-world deployment. Supplementary materials, including codes, task agent setup, trace outputs, and annotated examples of coordination failures and reasoning behaviors, are available at: https://byc-sophie.github.io/mas-to-mars/.

Abstract: The emergence of reasoning models and their integration into practical AI chat bots has led to breakthroughs in solving advanced math, deep search, and extractive question answering problems that requires a complex and multi-step thought process. Yet, a complete understanding of why these models hallucinate more than general purpose language models is missing. In this investigative study, we systematicallyexplore reasoning failures of contemporary language models on multi-hop question answering tasks. We introduce a novel, nuanced error categorization framework that examines failures across three critical dimensions: the diversity and uniqueness of source documents involved ("hops"), completeness in capturing relevant information ("coverage"), and cognitive inefficiency ("overthinking"). Through rigorous hu-man annotation, supported by complementary automated metrics, our exploration uncovers intricate error patterns often hidden by accuracy-centric evaluations. This investigative approach provides deeper insights into the cognitive limitations of current models and offers actionable guidance toward enhancing reasoning fidelity, transparency, and robustness in future language modeling efforts.

Abstract: Predicting Remaining Useful Life (RUL) plays a crucial role in the prognostics and health management of industrial systems that involve a variety of interrelated sensors. Given a constant stream of time series sensory data from such systems, deep learning models have risen to prominence at identifying complex, nonlinear temporal dependencies in these data. In addition to the temporal dependencies of individual sensors, spatial dependencies emerge as important correlations among these sensors, which can be naturally modelled by a temporal graph that describes time-varying spatial relationships. However, the majority of existing studies have relied on capturing discrete snapshots of this temporal graph, a coarse-grained approach that leads to loss of temporal information. Moreover, given the variety of heterogeneous sensors, it becomes vital that such inherent heterogeneity is leveraged for RUL prediction in temporal sensor graphs. To capture the nuances of the temporal and spatial relationships and heterogeneous characteristics in an interconnected graph of sensors, we introduce a novel model named Temporal and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (THGNN). Specifically, THGNN aggregates historical data from neighboring nodes to accurately capture the temporal dynamics and spatial correlations within the stream of sensor data in a fine-grained manner. Moreover, the model leverages Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to address the diversity of sensor types, significantly improving the model's capacity to learn the heterogeneity in the data sources. Finally, we have validated the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive experiments. Our empirical findings demonstrate significant advancements on the N-CMAPSS dataset, achieving improvements of up to 19.2% and 31.6% in terms of two different evaluation metrics over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Since the release of GPT2-1.5B in 2019, the large language models (LLMs) have evolved from specialized deep models to versatile foundation models. While demonstrating remarkable zero-shot ability, the LLMs still require fine-tuning on local datasets and substantial memory for deployment over the network edges. Traditional first-order fine-tuning techniques require significant GPU memory that exceeds the capacity of mainstream hardware. Besides, the LLMs have been expanded beyond text generation to create images, audio, video, and multi-modal content, necessitating careful investigation of efficient deployment strategies for large-scale foundation models. In response to these challenges, model fine-tuning and model-compression techniques have been developed to support the sustainable growth of LLMs by reducing both operational and capital expenditures. In this work, we provide a comprehensive overview of prevalent memory-efficient fine-tuning methods for deployment at the network edge. We also review state-of-the-art literature on model compression, offering insights into the deployment of LLMs at network edges.

Abstract: Super-resolution ultrasound imaging with ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) offers a high-resolution view of microvascular structures. Yet, ULM image quality heavily relies on precise microbubble (MB) detection. Despite the crucial role of localization algorithms, there has been limited focus on the practical pitfalls in MB detection tasks such as setting the detection threshold. This study examines how False Positives (FPs) and False Negatives (FNs) affect ULM image quality by systematically adding controlled detection errors to simulated data. Results indicate that while both FP and FN rates impact Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) similarly, increasing FP rates from 0\% to 20\% decreases Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) by 7\%, whereas same FN rates cause a greater drop of around 45\%. Moreover, dense MB regions are more resilient to detection errors, while sparse regions show high sensitivity, showcasing the need for robust MB detection frameworks to enhance super-resolution imaging.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in solving complex decision-making problems, yet its adoption in critical domains is hindered by the lack of interpretability in its decision-making processes. Existing explainable AI (xAI) approaches often fail to provide meaningful explanations for RL agents, particularly because they overlook the contrastive nature of human reasoning--answering "why this action instead of that one?". To address this gap, we propose a novel framework of contrastive learning to explain RL selected actions, named $\textbf{VisionMask}$. VisionMask is trained to generate explanations by explicitly contrasting the agent's chosen action with alternative actions in a given state using a self-supervised manner. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method through experiments across diverse RL environments, evaluating it in terms of faithfulness, robustness, and complexity. Our results show that VisionMask significantly improves human understanding of agent behavior while maintaining accuracy and fidelity. Furthermore, we present examples illustrating how VisionMask can be used for counterfactual analysis. This work bridges the gap between RL and xAI, paving the way for safer and more interpretable RL systems.

Abstract: The goal of inductive logic programming (ILP) is to find a set of logical rules that generalises training examples and background knowledge. We introduce an ILP approach that identifies pointless rules. A rule is pointless if it contains a redundant literal or cannot discriminate against negative examples. We show that ignoring pointless rules allows an ILP system to soundly prune the hypothesis space. Our experiments on multiple domains, including visual reasoning and game playing, show that our approach can reduce learning times by 99% whilst maintaining predictive accuracies.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in visual reasoning, yet come with substantial computational cost, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained settings. Despite recent effort on improving the efficiency of MLLMs, prior solutions fall short in responding to varying runtime conditions, in particular changing resource availability (e.g., contention due to the execution of other programs on the device). To bridge this gap, we introduce AdaLLaVA, an adaptive inference framework that learns to dynamically reconfigure operations in an MLLM during inference, accounting for the input data and a latency budget. We conduct extensive experiments across benchmarks involving question-answering, reasoning, and hallucination. Our results show that AdaLLaVA effectively adheres to input latency budget, achieving varying accuracy and latency tradeoffs at runtime. Further, we demonstrate that AdaLLaVA adapts to both input latency and content, can be integrated with token selection for enhanced efficiency, and generalizes across MLLMs. Our project webpage with code release is at https://zhuoyan-xu.github.io/ada-llava/.

<title>Adversarial Cooperative Rationalization: The Risk of Spurious Correlations in Even Clean Datasets</title>

Abstract: This study investigates the self-rationalization framework constructed with a cooperative game, where a generator initially extracts the most informative segment from raw input, and a subsequent predictor utilizes the selected subset for its input. The generator and predictor are trained collaboratively to maximize prediction accuracy. In this paper, we first uncover a potential caveat: such a cooperative game could unintentionally introduce a sampling bias during rationale extraction. Specifically, the generator might inadvertently create an incorrect correlation between the selected rationale candidate and the label, even when they are semantically unrelated in the original dataset. Subsequently, we elucidate the origins of this bias using both detailed theoretical analysis and empirical evidence. Our findings suggest a direction for inspecting these correlations through attacks, based on which we further introduce an instruction to prevent the predictor from learning the correlations. Through experiments on six text classification datasets and two graph classification datasets using three network architectures (GRUs, BERT, and GCN), we show that our method not only significantly outperforms recent rationalization methods, but also achieves comparable or even better results than a representative LLM (llama3.1-8b-instruct).

Abstract: Formal reasoning and automated theorem proving constitute a challenging subfield of machine learning, in which machines are tasked with proving mathematical theorems using formal languages like Lean. A formal verification system can check whether a formal proof is correct or not almost instantaneously, but generating a completely correct formal proof with LLMs remains a formidable task. The usual approach in the literature is to prompt the LLM many times (up to several thousands) until one of the generated proofs passes the verification system. In this work, we present APOLLO (Automated PrOof repair via LLM and Lean cOllaboration), a modular, modelagnostic pipeline that combines the strengths of the Lean compiler with an LLM's reasoning abilities to achieve better proofgeneration results at a low sampling budget. Apollo directs a fully automated process in which the LLM generates proofs for theorems, a set of agents analyze the proofs, fix the syntax errors, identify the mistakes in the proofs using Lean, isolate failing sublemmas, utilize automated solvers, and invoke an LLM on each remaining goal with a low budget. The repaired subproofs are recombined and reverified, iterating up to a usercontrolled maximum number of attempts. On the miniF2F benchmark, we establish a new stateoftheart accuracy of 84.9% among sub 8Bparameter models while keeping the sampling budget below one hundred. Moreover, Apollo raises the stateoftheart accuracy for GoedelProverSFT to 65.6% while cutting sample complexity from 25,600 to a few hundred. Generalpurpose models (o3mini, o4mini) jump from 3-7% to over 40% accuracy. Our results demonstrate that targeted, compilerguided repair of LLM outputs yields dramatic gains in both efficiency and correctness, suggesting a general paradigm for scalable automated theorem proving.

<title>The SWE-Bench Illusion: When State-of-the-Art LLMs Remember Instead of Reason</title>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly capable and widely adopted, benchmarks play a central role in assessing their practical utility. For example, SWE-Bench Verified has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating LLMs' software engineering abilities, particularly their aptitude for resolving real-world GitHub issues. Recent LLMs show impressive performance on SWE-Bench, leading to optimism about their capacity for complex coding tasks. However, current evaluation protocols may overstate these models' true capabilities. It is crucial to distinguish LLMs' generalizable problem-solving ability and other learned artifacts. In this work, we introduce two diagnostic tasks: file path identification from issue descriptions alone and ground truth function reproduction with only the current file context and issue description to probe models' underlying knowledge. We present empirical evidence that performance gains on SWE-Bench-Verified may be partially driven by memorization rather than genuine problem-solving. We show that state-of-the-art models achieve up to 76% accuracy in identifying buggy file paths using only issue descriptions, without access to repository structure. This performance is merely up to 53% on tasks from repositories not included in SWE-Bench, pointing to possible data contamination or memorization. Similar patterns are also observed for the function reproduction task, where the verbatim similarity is much higher on SWE-Bench Verified than on other similar coding benchmarks (up to 35% consecutive 5-gram accuracy on SWE-Bench Verified and Full, but only up to 18% for tasks in other benchmarks). These findings raise concerns about the validity of existing results and underscore the need for more robust, contamination-resistant benchmarks to reliably evaluate LLMs' coding abilities.

<title>SLR: Automated Synthesis for Scalable Logical Reasoning</title>

Abstract: We introduce SLR, an end-to-end framework for systematic evaluation and training of Large Language Models (LLMs) via Scalable Logical Reasoning. Given a user's task specification, SLR automatically synthesizes (i) an instruction prompt for an inductive reasoning task, (ii) a validation program, executable on model outputs to provide verifiable rewards, and (iii) the latent ground-truth rule. This process is fully automated, scalable, requires no human annotations, and offers precise control over task difficulty. Using SLR, we create SLR-Bench, a benchmark comprising 19k prompts organized into 20 curriculum levels that progressively increase in relational, arithmetic, and recursive complexity. Large-scale evaluation reveals that contemporary LLMs readily produce syntactically valid rules, yet often fail at correct logical inference. Recent reasoning LLMs demonstrate improved performance but incur very high test-time computation, with costs exceeding $300 for just 1,000 prompts. Finally, curriculum learning via SLR doubles Llama-3-8B accuracy on SLR-Bench, achieving parity with Gemini-Flash-Thinking at a fraction of computational cost. Moreover, these reasoning capabilities generalize to a wide range of established benchmarks, underscoring the effectiveness of SLR for downstream reasoning.

Abstract: Flawed planning from VLM-driven embodied agents poses significant safety hazards, hindering their deployment in real-world household tasks. However, existing static, non-interactive evaluation paradigms fail to adequately assess risks within these interactive environments, since they cannot simulate dynamic risks that emerge from an agent's actions and rely on unreliable post-hoc evaluations that ignore unsafe intermediate steps. To bridge this critical gap, we propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive emergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We thus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive safety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks instantiated in a high-fidelity simulator. Crucially, it facilitates a novel process-oriented evaluation that verifies whether risk mitigation actions are performed before/after specific risk-prone steps. Extensive experiments on leading VLMs, including the GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 series, reveal that current agents lack interactive safety awareness, and that while safety-aware Chain-of-Thought can improve performance, it often compromises task completion. By highlighting these critical limitations, IS-Bench provides a foundation for developing safer and more reliable embodied AI systems. Code and data are released under [this https URL](https://github.com/AI45Lab/IS-Bench).

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks but often suffer from overthinking, generating overly long and redundant reasoning trajectories. To explore its essence, our empirical analysis reveals that LRMs are primarily limited to recognizing task properties (i.e., difficulty levels) like humans before solving the problem, leading to a one-size-fits-all reasoning process. Inspired by this, a pressing and natural question emerges: Can we explicitly bootstrap such ability to alleviate overthinking in LRMs? In this paper, we propose Think-How-to-Think (TH2T), a novel two-stage fine-tuning strategy that progressively inspires LRMs' difficulty cognition and redundancy cognition of LRMs. Specifically, we first inject difficulty hypnosis into output prefixes to guide the model toward adaptive reasoning depth, trained on a hybrid dataset mixing short and long reasoning paths. Then, we incorporate redundancy hypnosis, which supervises the intermediate reasoning steps to identify and eliminate unnecessary reasoning patterns. Experiments on 7B/14B/32B models demonstrate that TH2T significantly reduces inference costs by over 70% on easy tasks and 40% on hard tasks while maintaining performance stability. The resulting outputs exhibit clear signs of difficulty-aware capabilities and reduced redundancy (e.g., reflection and looping).

Building upon ordinary Gauge Flow Models (arXiv:2507.13414), these Higher Gauge Flow Models leverage an L$_{\infty}$-algebra, effectively extending the Lie Algebra. This expansion allows for the integration of the higher geometry and higher symmetries associated with higher groups into the framework of Generative Flow Models. Experimental evaluation on a Gaussian Mixture Model dataset revealed substantial performance improvements compared to traditional Flow Models.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have exhibited state-of-the-art performance in various audio classification tasks. However, their real-time deployment remains a challenge on resource constrained devices such as embedded systems. In this paper, we analyze how the performance of large-scale pre-trained audio neural networks designed for audio pattern recognition changes when deployed on a hardware such as a Raspberry Pi. We empirically study the role of CPU temperature, microphone quality and audio signal volume on performance. Our experiments reveal that the continuous CPU usage results in an increased temperature that can trigger an automated slowdown mechanism in the Raspberry Pi, impacting inference latency. The quality of a microphone, specifically with affordable devices such as the Google AIY Voice Kit, and audio signal volume, all affect the system performance. In the course of our investigation, we encounter substantial complications linked to library compatibility and the unique processor architecture requirements of the Raspberry Pi, making the process less straightforward compared to conventional computers (PCs). Our observations, while presenting challenges, pave the way for future researchers to develop more compact machine learning models, design heat-dissipative hardware, and select appropriate microphones when AI models are deployed for real-time applications on edge devices.

Abstract: Graph-based semi-supervised learning (GSSL) has long been a hot research topic. Traditional methods are generally shallow learners, based on the cluster assumption. Recently, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have become the predominant techniques for their promising performance. In this paper, we theoretically discuss the relationship between these two types of methods in a unified optimization framework. One of the most intriguing findings is that, unlike traditional ones, typical GCNs may not jointly consider the graph structure and label information at each layer. Motivated by this, we further propose three simple but powerful graph convolution methods. The first is a supervised method OGC which guides the graph convolution process with labels. The others are two unsupervised methods: GGC and its multi-scale version GGCM, both aiming to preserve the graph structure information during the convolution process. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to show the effectiveness of our methods. Code is available at https://github.com/zhengwang100/ogc_ggcm.

Abstract: Human-centric perception tasks, e.g., pedestrian detection, skeleton-based action recognition, and pose estimation, have wide industrial applications, such as metaverse and sports analysis. There is a recent surge to develop human-centric foundation models that can benefit a broad range of human-centric perception tasks. While many human-centric foundation models have achieved success, they did not explore 3D and vision-language tasks for human-centric and required task-specific finetuning. These limitations restrict their application to more downstream tasks and situations. To tackle these problems, we present Hulk, the first multimodal human-centric generalist model, capable of addressing 2D vision, 3D vision, skeleton-based, and vision-language tasks without task-specific finetuning. The key to achieving this is condensing various task-specific heads into two general heads, one for discrete representations, \emph{e.g.,} languages, and the other for continuous representations, \emph{e.g.,} location coordinates. The outputs of two heads can be further stacked into four distinct input and output modalities. This uniform representation enables Hulk to treat diverse human-centric tasks as modality translation, integrating knowledge across a wide range of tasks. Comprehensive evaluations of Hulk on 12 benchmarks covering 8 human-centric tasks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art performance in 11 benchmarks. The code will be available on https://github.com/OpenGVLab/Hulk.

Abstract: Existing event stream based trackers undergo evaluation on short-term tracking datasets, however, the tracking of real-world scenarios involves long-term tracking, and the performance of existing tracking algorithms in these scenarios remains unclear. In this paper, we first propose a new long-term, large-scale frame-event visual object tracking dataset, termed FELT. It contains 1,044 long-term videos that involve 1.9 million RGB frames and event stream pairs, 60 different target objects, and 14 challenging attributes. To build a solid benchmark, we retrain and evaluate 21 baseline trackers on our dataset for future work to compare. In addition, we propose a novel Associative Memory Transformer based RGB-Event long-term visual tracker, termed AMTTrack. It follows a one-stream tracking framework and aggregates the multi-scale RGB/event template and search tokens effectively via the Hopfield retrieval layer. The framework also embodies another aspect of associative memory by maintaining dynamic template representations through an associative memory update scheme, which addresses the appearance variation in long-term tracking. Extensive experiments on FELT, FE108, VisEvent, and COESOT datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed tracker. Both the dataset and source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/FELT_SOT_Benchmark

Abstract: In practical scenarios, time series forecasting necessitates not only accuracy but also efficiency. Consequently, the exploration of model architectures remains a perennially trending topic in research. To address these challenges, we propose a novel backbone architecture named Time Evidence Fusion Network (TEFN) from the perspective of information fusion. Specifically, we introduce the Basic Probability Assignment (BPA) Module based on evidence theory to capture the uncertainty of multivariate time series data from both channel and time dimensions. Additionally, we develop a novel multi-source information fusion method to effectively integrate the two distinct dimensions from BPA output, leading to improved forecasting accuracy. Lastly, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that TEFN achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining significantly lower complexity and reduced training time. Also, our experiments show that TEFN exhibits high robustness, with minimal error fluctuations during hyperparameter selection. Furthermore, due to the fact that BPA is derived from fuzzy theory, TEFN offers a high degree of interpretability. Therefore, the proposed TEFN balances accuracy, efficiency, stability, and interpretability, making it a desirable solution for time series forecasting.

Abstract: City-scale traffic signal control (TSC) involves thousands of heterogeneous intersections with varying topologies, making cooperative decision-making across intersections particularly challenging. Given the prohibitive computational cost of learning individual policies for each intersection, some researchers explore learning a universal policy to control each intersection in a decentralized manner, where the key challenge is to construct a universal representation method for heterogeneous intersections. However, existing methods are limited to universally representing information of heterogeneous ego intersections, neglecting the essential representation of influence from their heterogeneous neighbors. Universally incorporating neighborhood information is nontrivial due to the intrinsic complexity of traffic flow interactions, as well as the challenge of modeling collective influences from neighbor intersections. To address these challenges, we propose CityLight, which learns a universal policy based on representations obtained with two major modules: a Neighbor Influence Encoder to explicitly model neighbor's influence with specified traffic flow relation and connectivity to the ego intersection; a Neighbor Influence Aggregator to attentively aggregate the influence of neighbors based on their mutual competitive relations. Extensive experiments on five city-scale datasets, ranging from 97 to 13,952 intersections, confirm the efficacy of CityLight, with an average throughput improvement of 11.68% and a lift of 22.59% for generalization.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Despite these advancements, LMs can inherit and amplify societal biases related to sensitive attributes such as gender and race, limiting their adoption in real-world applications. Therefore, fairness has been extensively explored in LMs, leading to the proposal of various fairness notions. However, the lack of clear agreement on which fairness definition to apply in specific contexts and the complexity of understanding the distinctions between these definitions can create confusion and impede further progress. To this end, this paper proposes a systematic survey that clarifies the definitions of fairness as they apply to LMs. Specifically, we begin with a brief introduction to LMs and fairness in LMs, followed by a comprehensive, up-to-date overview of existing fairness notions in LMs and the introduction of a novel taxonomy that categorizes these concepts based on their transformer architecture: encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder LMs. We further illustrate each definition through experiments, showcasing their practical implications and outcomes. Finally, we discuss current research challenges and open questions, aiming to foster innovative ideas and advance the field.

Abstract: To solve the problem of lateral and logitudinal joint decision-making of multi-vehicle cooperative driving for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), this paper proposes a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) method with parallel update for multi-agent Markov game with limited horizon and time discounted setting. By analyzing the parallel actions in the multi-vehicle joint action space in the partial-steady-state traffic flow, the parallel update method can quickly exclude potential dangerous actions, thereby increasing the search depth without sacrificing the search breadth. The proposed method is tested in a large number of randomly generated traffic flow. The experiment results show that the algorithm has good robustness and better performance than the SOTA reinforcement learning algorithms and heuristic methods. The vehicle driving strategy using the proposed algorithm shows rationality beyond human drivers, and has advantages in traffic efficiency and safety in the coordinating zone.

Abstract: Motivated by the incompleteness of modern knowledge graphs, a new setup for query answering has emerged, where the goal is to predict answers that do not necessarily appear in the knowledge graph, but are present in its completion. In this paper, we formally introduce and study two query answering problems, namely, query answer classification and query answer retrieval. To solve these problems, we propose AnyCQ, a model that can classify answers to any conjunctive query on any knowledge graph. At the core of our framework lies a graph neural network trained using a reinforcement learning objective to answer Boolean queries. Trained only on simple, small instances, AnyCQ generalizes to large queries of arbitrary structure, reliably classifying and retrieving answers to queries that existing approaches fail to handle. This is empirically validated through our newly proposed, challenging benchmarks. Finally, we empirically show that AnyCQ can effectively transfer to completely novel knowledge graphs when equipped with an appropriate link prediction model, highlighting its potential for querying incomplete data.

Abstract: Offering rich contexts to Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown to boost the performance in various tasks, but the resulting longer prompt would increase the computational cost and might exceed the input limit of LLMs. Recently, some prompt compression methods have been suggested to shorten the length of prompts by using language models to generate shorter prompts or by developing computational models to select important parts of original prompt. The generative compression methods would suffer from issues like hallucination, while the selective compression methods have not involved linguistic rules and overlook the global structure of prompt. To this end, we propose a novel selective compression method called PartPrompt. It first obtains a parse tree for each sentence based on linguistic rules, and calculates local information entropy for each node in a parse tree. These local parse trees are then organized into a global tree according to the hierarchical structure such as the dependency of sentences, paragraphs, and sections. After that, the root-ward propagation and leaf-ward propagation are proposed to adjust node values over the global tree. Finally, a recursive algorithm is developed to prune the global tree based on the adjusted node values. The experiments show that PartPrompt receives the state-of-the-art performance across various datasets, metrics, compression ratios, and target LLMs for inference. The in-depth ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of designs in PartPrompt, and other additional experiments also demonstrate its superiority in terms of the coherence of compressed prompts and in the extreme long prompt scenario.

Abstract: Recently, large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved significant advancements. When dealing with high-resolution images, dominant LMMs typically divide them into multiple local images and a global image, leading to a large number of visual tokens. In this work, we introduce AVG-LLaVA, an LMM that can adaptively select the appropriate visual granularity based on the input image and instruction. Specifically, we first apply the multiple pooling layers to obtain visual tokens at different granularities. Then we propose a visual granularity router, which includes a Transformer layer, an MLP layer, and a voter layer, used to select the appropriate visual granularity based on the image and instruction. Furthermore, we put forward RGLF, a novel training paradigm that aims at aligning the granularity predicted by the router with the preferences of the LMM, without the need for additional manually annotated data. Extensive experiments and analysis show that AVG-LLaVA achieves superior performance across 11 benchmarks, as well as significantly reduces the number of visual tokens and speeds up inference (e.g., an 85.3% reduction in visual tokens and a 2.53$\times$ increase in inference speed on the AI2D benchmark).

Abstract: As AI advances in text generation, human trust in AI generated content remains constrained by biases that go beyond concerns of accuracy. This study explores how bias shapes the perception of AI versus human generated content. Through three experiments involving text rephrasing, news article summarization, and persuasive writing, we investigated how human raters respond to labeled and unlabeled content. While the raters could not differentiate the two types of texts in the blind test, they overwhelmingly favored content labeled as "Human Generated," over those labeled "AI Generated," by a preference score of over 30%. We observed the same pattern even when the labels were deliberately swapped. This human bias against AI has broader societal and cognitive implications, as it undervalues AI performance. This study highlights the limitations of human judgment in interacting with AI and offers a foundation for improving human-AI collaboration, especially in creative fields.

Abstract: Bayesian models of cognition have gained considerable traction in computational neuroscience and psychiatry. Their scopes are now expected to expand rapidly to artificial intelligence, providing general inference frameworks to support embodied, adaptable, and energy-efficient autonomous agents. A central theory in this domain is predictive coding, which posits that learning and behaviour are driven by hierarchical probabilistic inferences about the causes of sensory inputs. Biological realism constrains these networks to rely on simple local computations in the form of precision-weighted predictions and prediction errors. This can make this framework highly efficient, but its implementation comes with unique challenges on the software development side. Embedding such models in standard neural network libraries often becomes limiting, as these libraries' compilation and differentiation backends can force a conceptual separation between optimization algorithms and the systems being optimized. This critically departs from other biological principles such as self-monitoring, self-organisation, cellular growth and functional plasticity. In this paper, we introduce \texttt{pyhgf}: a Python package backed by JAX and Rust for creating, manipulating and sampling dynamic networks for predictive coding. We improve over other frameworks by enclosing the network components as transparent, modular and malleable variables in the message-passing steps. The resulting graphs can implement arbitrary computational complexities as beliefs propagation. But the transparency of core variables can also translate into inference processes that leverage self-organisation principles, and express structure learning, meta-learning or causal discovery as the consequence of network structural adaptation to surprising inputs. The code, tutorials and documentation are hosted at: https://github.com/ilabcode/pyhgf.

Abstract: Recent advances in parameter-efficient transfer learning have demonstrated the utility of composing LoRA adapters from libraries of pretrained modules. However, most existing approaches rely on simple retrieval heuristics or uniform averaging, which overlook the latent structure of task relationships in representation space. We propose a new framework for adapter reuse that moves beyond retrieval, formulating adapter composition as a geometry-aware sparse reconstruction problem. Specifically, we represent each task by a latent prototype vector derived from the base model's encoder and aim to approximate the target task prototype as a sparse linear combination of retrieved reference prototypes, under an $\ell_1$-regularized optimization objective. The resulting combination weights are then used to blend the corresponding LoRA adapters, yielding a composite adapter tailored to the target task. This formulation not only preserves the local geometric structure of the task representation manifold, but also promotes interpretability and efficient reuse by selecting a minimal set of relevant adapters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple domains-including medical image segmentation, medical report generation and image synthesis. Our results highlight the benefit of coupling retrieval with latent geometry-aware optimization for improved zero-shot generalization.

Abstract: As our understanding of autism and ableism continues to increase, so does our understanding of ableist language towards autistic people. Such language poses a significant challenge in NLP research due to its subtle and context-dependent nature. Yet, detecting anti-autistic ableist language remains underexplored, with existing NLP tools often failing to capture its nuanced expressions. We present AUTALIC, the first benchmark dataset dedicated to the detection of anti-autistic ableist language in context, addressing a significant gap in the field. The dataset comprises 2,400 autism-related sentences collected from Reddit, accompanied by surrounding context, and is annotated by trained experts with backgrounds in neurodiversity. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that current language models, including state-of-the-art LLMs, struggle to reliably identify anti-autistic ableism and align with human judgments, underscoring their limitations in this domain. We publicly release AUTALIC along with the individual annotations which serve as a valuable resource to researchers working on ableism, neurodiversity, and also studying disagreements in annotation tasks. This dataset serves as a crucial step towards developing more inclusive and context-aware NLP systems that better reflect diverse perspectives.

<title>Causality-Driven Audits of Model Robustness</title>

Abstract: Robustness audits of deep neural networks (DNN) provide a means to uncover model sensitivities to the challenging real-world imaging conditions that significantly degrade DNN performance in-the-wild. Such conditions are often the result of multiple interacting factors inherent to the environment, sensor, or processing pipeline and may lead to complex image distortions that are not easily categorized. When robustness audits are limited to a set of isolated imaging effects or distortions, the results cannot be (easily) transferred to real-world conditions where image corruptions may be more complex or nuanced. To address this challenge, we present a new alternative robustness auditing method that uses causal inference to measure DNN sensitivities to the factors of the imaging process that cause complex distortions. Our approach uses causal models to explicitly encode assumptions about the domain-relevant factors and their interactions. Then, through extensive experiments on natural and rendered images across multiple vision tasks, we show that our approach reliably estimates causal effects of each factor on DNN performance using only observational domain data. These causal effects directly tie DNN sensitivities to observable properties of the imaging pipeline in the domain of interest towards reducing the risk of unexpected DNN failures when deployed in that domain.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning can enable policy learning from pre-collected, sub-optimal datasets without online interactions. This makes it ideal for real-world robots and safety-critical scenarios, where collecting online data or expert demonstrations is slow, costly, and risky. However, most existing offline RL works assume the dataset is already labeled with the task rewards, a process that often requires significant human effort, especially when ground-truth states are hard to ascertain (e.g., in the real-world). In this paper, we build on prior work, specifically RL-VLM-F, and propose a novel system that automatically generates reward labels for offline datasets using preference feedback from a vision-language model and a text description of the task. Our method then learns a policy using offline RL with the reward-labeled dataset. We demonstrate the system's applicability to a complex real-world robot-assisted dressing task, where we first learn a reward function using a vision-language model on a sub-optimal offline dataset, and then we use the learned reward to employ Implicit Q learning to develop an effective dressing policy. Our method also performs well in simulation tasks involving the manipulation of rigid and deformable objects, and significantly outperform baselines such as behavior cloning and inverse RL. In summary, we propose a new system that enables automatic reward labeling and policy learning from unlabeled, sub-optimal offline datasets.

Abstract: With recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), grounding and referring capabilities have gained increasing attention for achieving detailed understanding and flexible user interaction. However, these capabilities still remain underdeveloped in visual document understanding due to the scarcity of fine-grained datasets and comprehensive benchmarks. To fill this gap, we propose the DOcument Grounding and Referring data engine (DOGR-Engine), which generates two types of high-quality fine-grained document data: (1) multi-granular parsing data to improve text localization and recognition, and (2) instruction-tuning data to activate MLLMs' grounding and referring capabilities in dialogue and reasoning. Using the DOGR-Engine, we construct DOGR-Bench, a benchmark covering seven grounding and referring tasks across three document types (chart, poster, and PDF document), offering a comprehensive evaluation of fine-grained document understanding. Leveraging the generated data, we further develop DOGR, a strong baseline model that excels in text localization and recognition, while precisely grounds and refers to key textual information during conversation and reasoning, thereby advancing document understanding to a finer granularity and enable flexible interaction paradigms.

<title>3DTTNet: Multimodal Fusion-Based 3D Traversable Terrain Modeling for Off-Road Environments</title>

Abstract: Off-road environments remain significant challenges for autonomous ground vehicles, due to the lack of structured roads and the presence of complex obstacles, such as uneven terrain, vegetation, and occlusions. Traditional perception algorithms, primarily designed for structured environments, often fail in unstructured scenarios. In this paper, traversable area recognition is achieved through semantic scene completion. A novel multimodal method, 3DTTNet, is proposed to generate dense traversable terrain estimations by integrating LiDAR point clouds with monocular images from a forward-facing perspective. By integrating multimodal data, environmental feature extraction is strengthened, which is crucial for accurate terrain modeling in complex terrains. Furthermore, RELLIS-OCC, a dataset with 3D traversable annotations, is introduced, incorporating geometric features such as step height, slope, and unevenness. Through a comprehensive analysis of vehicle obsta cle-crossing conditions and the incorporation of vehicle body structure constraints, four traversability cost labels are generated: lethal, medium-cost, low-cost, and free. Experimental results demonstrate that 3DTTNet outperforms the comparison approaches in 3D traversable area recognition, particularly in off-road environments with irregular geometries and partial occlusions. Specifically, 3DTTNet achieves a 42\% improvement in scene completion IoU compared to other models. The proposed framework is scalable and adaptable to various vehicle platforms, allowing for adjustments to occupancy grid parameters and the integration of advanced dynamic models for traversability cost estimation.

<title>How Do Generative Models Draw a Software Engineer? A Case Study on Stable Diffusion Bias</title>

Abstract: Generative models are nowadays widely used to generate graphical content used for multiple purposes, e.g. web, art, advertisement. However, it has been shown that the images generated by these models could reinforce societal biases already existing in specific contexts. In this paper, we focus on understanding if this is the case when one generates images related to various software engineering tasks. In fact, the Software Engineering (SE) community is not immune from gender and ethnicity disparities, which could be amplified by the use of these models. Hence, if used without consciousness, artificially generated images could reinforce these biases in the SE domain. Specifically, we perform an extensive empirical evaluation of the gender and ethnicity bias exposed by three versions of the Stable Diffusion (SD) model (a very popular open-source text-to-image model) - SD 2, SD XL, and SD 3 - towards SE tasks. We obtain 6,720 images by feeding each model with two sets of prompts describing different software-related tasks: one set includes the Software Engineer keyword, and one set does not include any specification of the person performing the task. Next, we evaluate the gender and ethnicity disparities in the generated images. Results show how all models are significantly biased towards male figures when representing software engineers. On the contrary, while SD 2 and SD XL are strongly biased towards White figures, SD 3 is slightly more biased towards Asian figures. Nevertheless, all models significantly under-represent Black and Arab figures, regardless of the prompt style used. The results of our analysis highlight severe concerns about adopting those models to generate content for SE tasks and open the field for future research on bias mitigation in this context.

Abstract: Snapshot Compressed Imaging (SCI) offers high-speed, low-bandwidth, and energy-efficient image acquisition, but remains challenged by low-light and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Moreover, practical hardware constraints in high-resolution sensors limit the use of large frame-sized masks, necessitating smaller, hardware-friendly designs. In this work, we present a novel SCI-based computer vision framework using pseudo-random binary masks of only 8$\times$8 in size for physically feasible implementations. At its core is CompDAE, a Compressive Denoising Autoencoder built on the STFormer architecture, designed to perform downstream tasks--such as edge detection and depth estimation--directly from noisy compressive raw pixel measurements without image reconstruction. CompDAE incorporates a rate-constrained training strategy inspired by BackSlash to promote compact, compressible models. A shared encoder paired with lightweight task-specific decoders enables a unified multi-task platform. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that CompDAE achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly lower complexity, especially under ultra-low-light conditions where traditional CMOS and SCI pipelines fail.

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are often trained on datasets of query-response pairs, which embed the ability to use tools or APIs directly into the parametric knowledge of LLMs. Tool-augmented LLMs need the ability to forget learned tools due to security vulnerabilities, privacy regulations, or tool deprecations. However, ``tool unlearning'' has not been investigated in unlearning literature. We introduce this novel task, which requires addressing distinct challenges compared to traditional unlearning: knowledge removal rather than forgetting individual samples, the high cost of optimizing LLMs, and the need for principled evaluation metrics. To bridge these gaps, we propose ToolDelete, the first approach for unlearning tools from tool-augmented LLMs. It implements three key properties to address the above challenges for effective tool unlearning and introduces a new membership inference attack (MIA) model for effective evaluation. Extensive experiments on multiple tool learning datasets and tool-augmented LLMs show that ToolDelete effectively unlearns randomly selected tools, while preserving the LLM's knowledge on non-deleted tools and maintaining performance on general tasks.

Abstract: Hospitals struggle to predict critical outcomes. Traditional early warning systems, like NEWS and MEWS, rely on static variables and fixed thresholds, limiting their adaptability, accuracy, and personalization. We previously developed the Enhanced Transformer for Health Outcome Simulation (ETHOS), an AI model that tokenizes patient health timelines (PHTs) from EHRs and uses transformer-based architectures to predict future PHTs. ETHOS is a versatile framework for developing a wide range of applications. In this work, we develop the Adaptive Risk Estimation System (ARES) that leverages ETHOS to compute dynamic, personalized risk probabilities for clinician-defined critical events. ARES also features a personalized explainability module that highlights key clinical factors influencing risk estimates. We evaluated ARES using the MIMIC-IV v2.2 dataset together with its Emergency Department (ED) extension and benchmarked performance against both classical early warning systems and contemporary machine learning models. The entire dataset was tokenized resulting in 285,622 PHTs, comprising over 360 million tokens. ETHOS outperformed benchmark models in predicting hospital admissions, ICU admissions, and prolonged stays, achieving superior AUC scores. Its risk estimates were robust across demographic subgroups, with calibration curves confirming model reliability. The explainability module provided valuable insights into patient-specific risk factors. ARES, powered by ETHOS, advances predictive healthcare AI by delivering dynamic, real-time, personalized risk estimation with patient-specific explainability. Although our results are promising, the clinical impact remains uncertain. Demonstrating ARES's true utility in real-world settings will be the focus of our future work. We release the source code to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer severe performance degradation when facing extremely low-bit (sub 2-bit) quantization. Several existing sub 2-bit post-training quantization (PTQ) methods utilize a mix-precision scheme by leveraging an unstructured fine-grained mask to explicitly distinguish salient weights, while which introduces an extra 1-bit or more per weight. To explore the real limit of PTQ, we propose an extremely low-bit PTQ method called PTQ1.61, which enables weight quantization to 1.61-bit for the first time. Specifically, we first introduce a one-dimensional structured mask with negligibly additional 0.0002-bit per weight based on input activations from the perspective of reducing the upper bound of quantization error to allocate corresponding salient weight channels to 4-bit. For non-salient channels binarization, an efficient block-wise scaling factors optimization framework is then presented to take implicit row-wise correlations and angular biases into account. Different from prior works that concentrate on adjusting quantization methodologies, we further propose a novel paradigm called quantization preprocessing, where we argue that transforming the weight distribution of the pretrained model before quantization can alleviate the difficulty in per-channel extremely low-bit PTQ. Extensive experiments indicate our PTQ1.61 achieves state-of-the-art performance in extremely low-bit quantization. Codes are available at https://github.com/zjq0455/PTQ1.61.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal data, prevalent in real-world applications such as traffic monitoring, financial transactions, and ride-share demands, represents a specialized case of multivariate time series characterized by high dimensionality. This high dimensionality necessitates computationally efficient models and benefits from applying univariate forecasting approaches through channel-independent strategies. SparseTSF, a recently proposed competitive univariate forecasting model, leverages periodicity to achieve compactness by focusing on cross-period dynamics, extending the Pareto frontier in terms of model size and predictive performance. However, it underperforms on spatio-temporal data due to limited capture of intra-period temporal dependencies. To address this limitation, we propose UltraSTF, which integrates a cross-period forecasting component with an ultra-compact shape bank component. Our model efficiently captures recurring patterns in time series using the attention mechanism of the shape bank component, significantly enhancing its capability to learn intra-period dynamics. UltraSTF achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LargeST benchmark while utilizing fewer than 0.2% of the parameters required by the second-best methods, thereby further extending the Pareto frontier of existing approaches.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF), which focuses on finding collision-free paths for multiple robots, is crucial for applications ranging from aerial swarms to warehouse automation. Solving MAPF is NP-hard so learning-based approaches for MAPF have gained attention, particularly those leveraging deep neural networks. Nonetheless, despite the community's continued efforts, all learning-based MAPF planners still rely on decentralized planning due to variability in the number of agents and map sizes. We have developed the first centralized learning-based policy for MAPF problem called RAILGUN. RAILGUN is not an agent-based policy but a map-based policy. By leveraging a CNN-based architecture, RAILGUN can generalize across different maps and handle any number of agents. We collect trajectories from rule-based methods to train our model in a supervised way. In experiments, RAILGUN outperforms most baseline methods and demonstrates great zero-shot generalization capabilities on various tasks, maps and agent numbers that were not seen in the training dataset.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) involves finding collision-free paths for multiple agents while minimizing a cost function--an NP-hard problem. Bounded suboptimal methods like Enhanced Conflict-Based Search (ECBS) and Explicit Estimation CBS (EECBS) balance solution quality with computational efficiency using focal search mechanisms. While effective, traditional focal search faces a limitation: the lower bound (LB) value determining which nodes enter the FOCAL list often increases slowly in early search stages, resulting in a constrained search space that delays finding valid solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel bounded suboptimal algorithm, double-ECBS (DECBS), to address this issue by first determining the maximum LB value and then employing a best-first search guided by this LB to find a collision-free path. Experimental results demonstrate that DECBS outperforms ECBS in most test cases and is compatible with existing optimization techniques. DECBS can reduce nearly 30% high-level CT nodes and 50% low-level focal search nodes. When agent density is moderate to high, DECBS achieves a 23.5% average runtime improvement over ECBS with identical suboptimality bounds and optimizations.

Abstract: This paper addresses query scheduling for goal-oriented semantic communication in pull-based status update systems. We consider a system where multiple sensing agents (SAs) observe a source characterized by various attributes and provide updates to multiple actuation agents (AAs), which act upon the received information to fulfill their heterogeneous goals at the endpoint. A hub serves as an intermediary, querying the SAs for updates on observed attributes and maintaining a knowledge base, which is then broadcast to the AAs. The AAs leverage the knowledge to perform their actions effectively. To quantify the semantic value of updates, we introduce a grade of effectiveness (GoE) metric. Furthermore, we integrate cumulative perspective theory (CPT) into the long-term effectiveness analysis to account for risk awareness and loss aversion in the system. Leveraging this framework, we compute effect-aware scheduling policies aimed at maximizing the expected discounted sum of CPT-based total GoE provided by the transmitted updates while complying with a given query cost constraint. To achieve this, we propose a model-based solution based on dynamic programming and model-free solutions employing state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms. Our findings demonstrate that effect-aware scheduling significantly enhances the effectiveness of communicated updates compared to benchmark scheduling methods, particularly in settings with stringent cost constraints where optimal query scheduling is vital for system performance and overall effectiveness.

Abstract: Efficiently acquiring external knowledge and up-to-date information is essential for effective reasoning and text generation in large language models (LLMs). Prompting advanced LLMs with reasoning capabilities to use search engines during inference is often suboptimal, as the LLM might not fully possess the capability on how to interact optimally with the search engine. This paper introduces Search-R1, an extension of reinforcement learning (RL) for reasoning frameworks where the LLM learns to autonomously generate (multiple) search queries during step-by-step reasoning with real-time retrieval. Search-R1 optimizes LLM reasoning trajectories with multi-turn search interactions, leveraging retrieved token masking for stable RL training and a simple outcome-based reward function. Experiments on seven question-answering datasets show that Search-R1 improves performance by 41% (Qwen2.5-7B) and 20% (Qwen2.5-3B) over various RAG baselines under the same setting. This paper further provides empirical insights into RL optimization methods, LLM choices, and response length dynamics in retrieval-augmented reasoning.

Abstract: Existing vision-language models (VLMs) often suffer from visual hallucination, where the generated responses contain inaccuracies that are not grounded in the visual input. Efforts to address this issue without model finetuning primarily mitigate hallucination by contrastively reducing language biases or amplifying the weights of visual embedding during decoding. However, these approaches remain limited in their ability to capture fine-grained visual details. In this work, we propose the Perception Magnifier (PM), a novel visual decoding method that iteratively isolates relevant visual tokens based on attention and magnifies the corresponding regions, spurring the model to concentrate on fine-grained visual details during decoding. By magnifying critical regions while preserving the structural and contextual information at each decoding step, PM allows the VLM to enhance its scrutiny of the visual input, hence producing more accurate and faithful responses. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PM not only achieves superior hallucination mitigation but also enhances language generation while preserving strong reasoning capabilities.

<title>The Impact of Item-Writing Flaws on Difficulty and Discrimination in Item Response Theory</title>

Abstract: High-quality test items are essential for educational assessments, particularly within Item Response Theory (IRT). Traditional validation methods rely on resource-intensive pilot testing to estimate item difficulty and discrimination. More recently, Item-Writing Flaw (IWF) rubrics emerged as a domain-general approach for evaluating test items based on textual features. This method offers a scalable, pre-deployment evaluation without requiring student data, but its predictive validity concerning empirical IRT parameters is underexplored. To address this gap, we conducted a study involving 7,126 multiple-choice questions across various STEM subjects (physical science, mathematics, and life/earth sciences). Using an automated approach, we annotated each question with a 19-criteria IWF rubric and studied relationships to data-driven IRT parameters. Our analysis revealed statistically significant links between the number of IWFs and IRT difficulty and discrimination parameters, particularly in life/earth and physical science domains. We further observed how specific IWF criteria can impact item quality more and less severely (e.g., negative wording vs. implausible distractors) and how they might make a question more or less challenging. Overall, our findings establish automated IWF analysis as a valuable supplement to traditional validation, providing an efficient method for initial item screening, particularly for flagging low-difficulty MCQs. Our findings show the need for further research on domain-general evaluation rubrics and algorithms that understand domain-specific content for robust item validation.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across various domains; however, their ability to comprehend driving scenes remains less proven. The complexity of driving scenarios, which includes multi-view information, poses significant challenges for existing MLLMs. In this paper, we introduce NuPlanQA-Eval, a multi-view, multi-modal evaluation benchmark for driving scene understanding. To further support generalization to multi-view driving scenarios, we also propose NuPlanQA-1M, a large-scale dataset comprising 1M real-world visual question-answering (VQA) pairs. For context-aware analysis of traffic scenes, we categorize our dataset into nine subtasks across three core skills: Road Environment Perception, Spatial Relations Recognition, and Ego-Centric Reasoning. Furthermore, we present BEV-LLM, integrating Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features from multi-view images into MLLMs. Our evaluation results reveal key challenges that existing MLLMs face in driving scene-specific perception and spatial reasoning from ego-centric perspectives. In contrast, BEV-LLM demonstrates remarkable adaptability to this domain, outperforming other models in six of the nine subtasks. These findings highlight how BEV integration enhances multi-view MLLMs while also identifying key areas that require further refinement for effective adaptation to driving scenes. To facilitate further research, we publicly release NuPlanQA at https://github.com/sungyeonparkk/NuPlanQA.

Abstract: DeepSeek-R1 has shown that long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning can naturally emerge through a simple reinforcement learning (RL) framework with rule-based rewards, where the training may directly start from the base models-a paradigm referred to as zero RL training. Most recent efforts to reproduce zero RL training have primarily focused on the Qwen2.5 model series, which may not be representative as we find the base models already exhibit strong instruction-following and self-reflection abilities. In this work, we investigate zero RL training across 10 diverse base models, spanning different families and sizes including LLama3-8B, Mistral-7B/24B, DeepSeek-Math-7B, Qwen2.5-math-7B, and all Qwen2.5 models from 0.5B to 32B. Leveraging several key design strategies-such as adjusting format reward and controlling query difficulty-we achieve substantial improvements in both reasoning accuracy and response length across most settings. However, by carefully monitoring the training dynamics, we observe that different base models exhibit distinct patterns during training. For instance, the increased response length does not always correlate with the emergence of certain cognitive behaviors such as verification (i.e., the "aha moment"). Notably, we observe the "aha moment" for the first time in small models not from the Qwen family. We share the key designs that enable successful zero RL training, along with our findings and practices. To facilitate further research, we open-source the code, models, and analysis tools.

Abstract: Cotraining with demonstration data generated both in simulation and on real hardware has emerged as a promising recipe for scaling imitation learning in robotics. This work seeks to elucidate basic principles of this sim-and-real cotraining to inform simulation design, sim-and-real dataset creation, and policy training. Our experiments confirm that cotraining with simulated data can dramatically improve performance, especially when real data is limited. We show that these performance gains scale with additional simulated data up to a plateau; adding more real-world data increases this performance ceiling. The results also suggest that reducing physical domain gaps may be more impactful than visual fidelity for non-prehensile or contact-rich tasks. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that some visual gap can help cotraining -- binary probes reveal that high-performing policies must learn to distinguish simulated domains from real. We conclude by investigating this nuance and mechanisms that facilitate positive transfer between sim-and-real. Focusing narrowly on the canonical task of planar pushing from pixels allows us to be thorough in our study. In total, our experiments span 50+ real-world policies (evaluated on 1000+ trials) and 250 simulated policies (evaluated on 50,000+ trials).

Abstract: Since the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) popularized by the release of GPT-3 and ChatGPT, LLMs have shown remarkable promise in programming-related tasks. While code generation using LLMs has become a popular field of research, code evaluation using LLMs remains under-explored. In this paper, we focus on LLM-based code evaluation and attempt to fill in the existing gaps. We propose multi-agentic novel approaches using \emph{question-specific rubrics} tailored to the problem statement, arguing that these perform better for logical assessment than the existing approaches that use \emph{question-agnostic rubrics}. To address the lack of suitable evaluation datasets, we introduce two datasets: a Data Structures and Algorithms dataset containing 150 student submissions from a popular Data Structures and Algorithms practice website, and an Object Oriented Programming dataset comprising 80 student submissions from undergraduate computer science courses. In addition to using standard metrics (Spearman Correlation, Cohen's Kappa), we additionally propose a new metric called as Leniency, which quantifies evaluation strictness relative to expert assessment. Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates that \emph{question-specific rubrics} significantly enhance logical assessment of code in educational settings, providing better feedback aligned with instructional goals beyond mere syntactic correctness.

<title>CITRAS: Covariate-Informed Transformer for Time Series Forecasting</title>

Abstract: In practical time series forecasting, covariates provide rich contextual information that can potentially enhance the forecast of target variables. Although some covariates extend into the future forecasting horizon (e.g., calendar events, discount schedules), most multivariate models fail to leverage this pivotal insight due to the length discrepancy with target variables. Additionally, capturing the dependency between target variables and covariates is non-trivial, as models must precisely reflect the local impact of covariates while also capturing global cross-variate dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we propose CITRAS, a decoder-only Transformer that flexibly leverages multiple targets, past covariates, and future covariates. While preserving strong autoregressive capabilities, CITRAS introduces two novel mechanisms in patch-wise cross-variate attention: Key-Value (KV) Shift and Attention Score Smoothing. KV Shift seamlessly incorporates future covariates into the forecasting of target variables based on their concurrent dependencies. Additionally, Attention Score Smoothing refines locally accurate patch-wise cross-variate dependencies into global variate-level dependencies by smoothing the past series of attention scores. Experimentally, CITRAS outperforms state-of-the-art models on thirteen real-world benchmarks from both covariate-informed and multivariate settings, demonstrating its versatile ability to leverage cross-variate and cross-time dependencies for improved forecasting accuracy.

Abstract: Wide-angle cameras, despite their popularity for content creation, suffer from distortion-induced facial stretching-especially at the edge of the lens-which degrades visual appeal. To address this issue, we propose a structure-to-detail portrait correction model named ImagePC. It integrates the long-range awareness of the transformer and multi-step denoising of diffusion models into a unified framework, achieving global structural robustness and local detail refinement. Besides, considering the high cost of obtaining video labels, we then repurpose ImagePC for unlabeled wide-angle videos (termed VideoPC), by spatiotemporal diffusion adaption with spatial consistency and temporal smoothness constraints. For the former, we encourage the denoised image to approximate pseudo labels following the wide-angle distortion distribution pattern, while for the latter, we derive rectification trajectories with backward optical flows and smooth them. Compared with ImagePC, VideoPC maintains high-quality facial corrections in space and mitigates the potential temporal shakes sequentially in blind scenarios. Finally, to establish an evaluation benchmark and train the framework, we establish a video portrait dataset with a large diversity in the number of people, lighting conditions, and background. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform existing solutions quantitatively and qualitatively, contributing to high-fidelity wide-angle videos with stable and natural portraits. The codes and dataset will be available.

Abstract: Deep learning-based electrocardiogram (ECG) classification has shown impressive performance but clinical adoption has been slowed by the lack of transparent and faithful explanations. Post hoc methods such as saliency maps may fail to reflect a model's true decision process. Prototype-based reasoning offers a more transparent alternative by grounding decisions in similarity to learned representations of real ECG segments, enabling faithful, case-based explanations. We introduce ProtoECGNet, a prototype-based deep learning model for interpretable, multi-label ECG classification. ProtoECGNet employs a structured, multi-branch architecture that reflects clinical interpretation workflows: it integrates a 1D CNN with global prototypes for rhythm classification, a 2D CNN with time-localized prototypes for morphology-based reasoning, and a 2D CNN with global prototypes for diffuse abnormalities. Each branch is trained with a prototype loss designed for multi-label learning, combining clustering, separation, diversity, and a novel contrastive loss that encourages appropriate separation between prototypes of unrelated classes while allowing clustering for frequently co-occurring diagnoses. We evaluate ProtoECGNet on all 71 diagnostic labels from the PTB-XL dataset, demonstrating competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art black-box models while providing structured, case-based explanations. To assess prototype quality, we conduct a structured clinician review of the final model's projected prototypes, finding that they are rated as representative and clear. ProtoECGNet shows that prototype learning can be effectively scaled to complex, multi-label time-series classification, offering a practical path toward transparent and trustworthy deep learning models for clinical decision support.

<title>RGB-Event based Pedestrian Attribute Recognition: A Benchmark Dataset and An Asymmetric RWKV Fusion Framework</title>

Abstract: Existing pedestrian attribute recognition methods are generally developed based on RGB frame cameras. However, these approaches are constrained by the limitations of RGB cameras, such as sensitivity to lighting conditions and motion blur, which hinder their performance. Furthermore, current attribute recognition primarily focuses on analyzing pedestrians' external appearance and clothing, lacking an exploration of emotional dimensions. In this paper, we revisit these issues and propose a novel multi-modal RGB-Event attribute recognition task by drawing inspiration from the advantages of event cameras in low-light, high-speed, and low-power consumption. Specifically, we introduce the first large-scale multi-modal pedestrian attribute recognition dataset, termed EventPAR, comprising 100K paired RGB-Event samples that cover 50 attributes related to both appearance and six human emotions, diverse scenes, and various seasons. By retraining and evaluating mainstream PAR models on this dataset, we establish a comprehensive benchmark and provide a solid foundation for future research in terms of data and algorithmic baselines. In addition, we propose a novel RWKV-based multi-modal pedestrian attribute recognition framework, featuring an RWKV visual encoder and an asymmetric RWKV fusion module. Extensive experiments are conducted on our proposed dataset as well as two simulated datasets (MARS-Attribute and DukeMTMC-VID-Attribute), achieving state-of-the-art results. The source code and dataset will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/OpenPAR

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-based weather forecasting models, such as FourCastNet, Pangu-Weather, and GraphCast, have demonstrated the remarkable ability of deep learning to emulate complex atmospheric dynamics. Building on this momentum, we propose Mj\"olnir, a novel deep learning-based framework for global lightning flash density parameterization. Trained on ERA5 atmospheric predictors and World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) observations at a daily temporal resolution and 1 degree spatial resolution, Mj\"olnir captures the nonlinear mapping between large-scale environmental conditions and lightning activity. The model architecture is based on the InceptionNeXt backbone with SENet, and a multi-task learning strategy to simultaneously predict lightning occurrence and magnitude. Extensive evaluations yield that Mollnir accurately reproduces the global distribution, seasonal variability, and regional characteristics of lightning activity, achieving a global Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.96 for annual mean fields. These results suggest that Mj\"olnir serves not only as an effective data-driven global lightning parameterization but also as a promising AI-based scheme for next-generation Earth system models (AI-ESMs).

<title>CostFilter-AD: Enhancing Anomaly Detection through Matching Cost Filtering</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.01476v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) seeks to localize the anomaly mask of an input image with respect to normal samples. Either by reconstructing normal counterparts (reconstruction-based) or by learning an image feature embedding space (embedding-based), existing approaches fundamentally rely on image-level or feature-level matching to derive anomaly scores. Often, such a matching process is inaccurate yet overlooked, leading to sub-optimal detection. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of cost filtering, borrowed from classical matching tasks, such as depth and flow estimation, into the UAD problem. We call this approach {\em CostFilter-AD}. Specifically, we first construct a matching cost volume between the input and normal samples, comprising two spatial dimensions and one matching dimension that encodes potential matches. To refine this, we propose a cost volume filtering network, guided by the input observation as an attention query across multiple feature layers, which effectively suppresses matching noise while preserving edge structures and capturing subtle anomalies. Designed as a generic post-processing plug-in, CostFilter-AD can be integrated with either reconstruction-based or embedding-based methods. Extensive experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA benchmarks validate the generic benefits of CostFilter-AD for both single- and multi-class UAD tasks. Code and models will be released at https://github.com/ZHE-SAPI/CostFilter-AD.

arXiv:2505.09742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a generative, end-to-end solver for black-box combinatorial optimization that emphasizes both sample efficiency and solution quality on NP problems. Drawing inspiration from annealing-based algorithms, we treat the black-box objective as an energy function and train a neural network to model the associated Boltzmann distribution. By conditioning on temperature, the network captures a continuum of distributions--from near-uniform at high temperatures to sharply peaked around global optima at low temperatures--thereby learning the structure of the energy landscape and facilitating global optimization. When queries are expensive, the temperature-dependent distributions naturally enable data augmentation and improve sample efficiency. When queries are cheap but the problem remains hard, the model learns implicit variable interactions, effectively "opening" the black box. We validate our approach on challenging combinatorial tasks under both limited and unlimited query budgets, showing competitive performance against state-of-the-art black-box optimizers.

Abstract: The question of "what is life?" has challenged scientists and philosophers for centuries, producing an array of definitions that reflect both the mystery of its emergence and the diversity of disciplinary perspectives brought to bear on the question. Despite significant progress in our understanding of biological systems, psychology, computation, and information theory, no single definition for life has yet achieved universal acceptance. This challenge becomes increasingly urgent as advances in synthetic biology, artificial intelligence, and astrobiology challenge our traditional conceptions of what it means to be alive. We undertook a methodological approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze a set of definitions of life provided by a curated set of cross-disciplinary experts. We used a novel pairwise correlation analysis to map the definitions into distinct feature vectors, followed by agglomerative clustering, intra-cluster semantic analysis, and t-SNE projection to reveal underlying conceptual archetypes. This methodology revealed a continuous landscape of the themes relating to the definition of life, suggesting that what has historically been approached as a binary taxonomic problem should be instead conceived as differentiated perspectives within a unified conceptual latent space. We offer a new methodological bridge between reductionist and holistic approaches to fundamental questions in science and philosophy, demonstrating how computational semantic analysis can reveal conceptual patterns across disciplinary boundaries, and opening similar pathways for addressing other contested definitional territories across the sciences.

Abstract: Personalizing jargon detection and explanation is essential for making technical documents accessible to readers with diverse disciplinary backgrounds. However, tailoring models to individual users typically requires substantial annotation efforts and computational resources due to user-specific finetuning. To address this, we present a systematic study of personalized jargon detection, focusing on methods that are both efficient and scalable for real-world deployment. We explore two personalization strategies: (1) lightweight fine-tuning using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on open-source models, and (2) personalized prompting, which tailors model behavior at inference time without retaining. To reflect realistic constraints, we also investigate hybrid approaches that combine limited annotated data with unsupervised user background signals. Our personalized LoRA model outperforms GPT-4 by 21.4% in F1 score and exceeds the best performing oracle baseline by 8.3%. Remarkably, our method achieves comparable performance using only 10% of the annotated training data, demonstrating its practicality for resource-constrained settings. Our study offers the first work to systematically explore efficient, low-resource personalization of jargon detection using open-source language models, offering a practical path toward scalable, user-adaptive NLP system.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced many applications, but are also known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this work, we introduce a novel security threat: hijacking AI-human conversations by manipulating LLMs' system prompts to produce malicious answers only to specific targeted questions (e.g., "Who should I vote for US President?", "Are Covid vaccines safe?"), while behaving benignly on others. This attack is detrimental as it can enable malicious actors to exercise large-scale information manipulation by spreading harmful but benign-looking system prompts online. To demonstrate such an attack, we develop CAIN, an algorithm that can automatically curate such harmful system prompts for a specific target question in a black-box setting or without the need to access the LLM's parameters. Evaluated on both open-source and commercial LLMs, CAIN demonstrates significant adversarial impact. In untargeted attacks or forcing LLMs to output incorrect answers, CAIN achieves up to 40% F1 degradation on targeted questions while preserving high accuracy on benign inputs. For targeted attacks or forcing LLMs to output specific harmful answers, CAIN achieves over 70% F1 scores on these targeted responses with minimal impact on benign questions. Our results highlight the critical need for enhanced robustness measures to safeguard the integrity and safety of LLMs in real-world applications. All source code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Human-generated reward signals are critical for aligning generative models with human preferences, guiding both training and inference-time evaluations. While large language models (LLMs) employed as proxy evaluators, i.e., LLM-as-a-Judge, significantly reduce the costs associated with manual annotations, they typically require extensive modality-specific training data and fail to generalize well across diverse multimodal tasks. In this paper, we propose Flex-Judge, a reasoning-guided multimodal judge model that leverages minimal textual reasoning data to robustly generalize across multiple modalities and evaluation formats. Our core intuition is that structured textual reasoning explanations inherently encode generalizable decision-making patterns, enabling an effective transfer to multimodal judgments, e.g., with images or videos. Empirical results demonstrate that Flex-Judge, despite being trained on significantly fewer text data, achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art commercial APIs and extensively trained multimodal evaluators. Notably, Flex-Judge presents broad impact in modalities like molecule, where comprehensive evaluation benchmarks are scarce, underscoring its practical value in resource-constrained domains. Our framework highlights reasoning-based text supervision as a powerful, cost-effective alternative to traditional annotation-intensive approaches, substantially advancing scalable multimodal model-as-a-judge.

Abstract: Extended reality (XR) systems, which consist of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (XR), offer a transformative interface for immersive, multi-modal, and embodied human-computer interaction. In this paper, we envision that multi-modal multi-task (M3T) federated foundation models (FedFMs) can offer transformative capabilities for XR systems through integrating the representational strength of M3T foundation models (FMs) with the privacy-preserving model training principles of federated learning (FL). We present a modular architecture for FedFMs, which entails different coordination paradigms for model training and aggregations. Central to our vision is the codification of XR challenges that affect the implementation of FedFMs under the SHIFT dimensions: (1) Sensor and modality diversity, (2) Hardware heterogeneity and system-level constraints, (3) Interactivity and embodied personalization, (4) Functional/task variability, and (5) Temporality and environmental variability. We illustrate the manifestation of these dimensions across a set of emerging and anticipated applications of XR systems. Finally, we propose evaluation metrics, dataset requirements, and design tradeoffs necessary for the development of resource-aware FedFMs in XR. This perspective aims to chart the technical and conceptual foundations for context-aware privacy-preserving intelligence in the next generation of XR systems.

<title>On the Fundamental Impossibility of Hallucination Control in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: This paper establishes a fundamental impossibility theorem: no LLM capable performing non-trivial knowledge aggregation can simultaneously achieve truthful (internally consistent) knowledge representation, semantic information conservation, complete revelation of relevant knowledge, and knowledge-constrained optimality. This impossibility is not an engineering limitation but arises from the mathematical structure of information aggregation itself. We establish this result by describing the inference process as an auction of ideas, where distributed components compete exploiting their partial knowledge to shape responses. The proof spans three independent mathematical domains: mechanism design theory (Green-Laffont), the theory of proper scoring rules (Savage), and direct architectural analysis of transformers (Log-Sum-Exp convexity). In particular, we show how in the strictly concave settings the score of an aggregate of diverse beliefs strictly exceeds the sum of individual scores. That gap may quantify the creation of unattributable certainty or overconfidence -- the mathematical origin of both hallucination and creativity, or imagination.
  To support this analysis, we introduce the complementary concepts of the semantic information measure and the emergence operator to model bounded reasoning in a general setting. We prove that while bounded reasoning generates accessible information, providing valuable insights and inspirations, idealized reasoning strictly preserves semantic content. By demonstrating that hallucination and imagination are mathematically identical phenomena-grounded in the necessary violation of information conservation-this paper offers a principled foundation for managing these behaviors in advanced AI systems. Finally, we present some speculative ideas to inspire evaluation and refinements of the proposed theory.

<title>AtmosMJ: Revisiting Gating Mechanism for AI Weather Forecasting Beyond the Year Scale</title>

Abstract: The advent of Large Weather Models (LWMs) has marked a turning point in data-driven forecasting, with many models now outperforming traditional numerical systems in the medium range. However, achieving stable, long-range autoregressive forecasts beyond a few weeks remains a significant challenge. Prevailing state-of-the-art models that achieve year-long stability, such as SFNO and DLWP-HPX, have relied on transforming input data onto non-standard spatial domains like spherical harmonics or HEALPix meshes. This has led to the prevailing assumption that such representations are necessary to enforce physical consistency and long-term stability. This paper challenges that assumption by investigating whether comparable long-range performance can be achieved on the standard latitude-longitude grid. We introduce AtmosMJ, a deep convolutional network that operates directly on ERA5 data without any spherical remapping. The model's stability is enabled by a novel Gated Residual Fusion (GRF) mechanism, which adaptively moderates feature updates to prevent error accumulation over long recursive simulations. Our results demonstrate that AtmosMJ produces stable and physically plausible forecasts for about 500 days. In quantitative evaluations, it achieves competitive 10-day forecast accuracy against models like Pangu-Weather and GraphCast, all while requiring a remarkably low training budget of 5.7 days on a V100 GPU. Our findings suggest that efficient architectural design, rather than non-standard data representation, can be the key to unlocking stable and computationally efficient long-range weather prediction.

Abstract: Autonomous agents for Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are revolutionizing human-computer interaction, yet their reliance on text-based instructions imposes limitations on accessibility and convenience, particularly in hands-free scenarios. To address this issue, we propose replacing text with speech as the instruction input modality for GUI agents, and introduce UITron-Speech, which is the first end-to-end GUI agent capable of directly processing speech instructions and on-device screenshots to predict user actions. To tackle the problem of data scarcity, we synthesize high-quality speech instruction datasets using a random-speaker text-to-speech model. Additionally, we design a mixed-modality training strategy to mitigate the inherent modality imbalance in pre-trained foundation models. Furthermore, we conduct a statistical analysis of the distribution of GUI grounding prediction errors and propose a training-free two-step grounding refinement method to alleviate minor localization deviations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that UITron-Speech achieves robust performance and superior adaptability, underscoring the feasibility and potential of speech-driven GUI agents for more accessible and intelligent human-computer interaction.

<title>Thought Anchors: Which LLM Reasoning Steps Matter?</title>

arXiv:2506.19143v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reasoning large language models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance in many fields. However, their long-form chain-of-thought reasoning creates interpretability challenges as each generated token depends on all previous ones, making the computation harder to decompose. We argue that analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to understanding reasoning processes. We present three complementary attribution methods: (1) a black-box method measuring each sentence's counterfactual importance by comparing final answers across 100 rollouts conditioned on the model generating that sentence or one with a different meaning; (2) a white-box method of aggregating attention patterns between pairs of sentences, which identified "broadcasting" sentences that receive disproportionate attention from all future sentences via "receiver" attention heads; (3) a causal attribution method measuring logical connections between sentences by suppressing attention toward one sentence and measuring the effect on each future sentence's tokens. Each method provides evidence for the existence of thought anchors, reasoning steps that have outsized importance and that disproportionately influence the subsequent reasoning process. These thought anchors are typically planning or backtracking sentences. We provide an open-source tool (www.thought-anchors.com) for visualizing the outputs of our methods, and present a case study showing converging patterns across methods that map how a model performs multi-step reasoning. The consistency across methods demonstrates the potential of sentence-level analysis for a deeper understanding of reasoning models.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based segmentation methods focus on object semantics and rely solely on RGB data, lacking intrinsic material properties. This limitation restricts accurate material perception, which is crucial for robotics, augmented reality, simulation, and other applications. We introduce UnMix-NeRF, a framework that integrates spectral unmixing into NeRF, enabling joint hyperspectral novel view synthesis and unsupervised material segmentation. Our method models spectral reflectance via diffuse and specular components, where a learned dictionary of global endmembers represents pure material signatures, and per-point abundances capture their distribution. For material segmentation, we use spectral signature predictions along learned endmembers, allowing unsupervised material clustering. Additionally, UnMix-NeRF enables scene editing by modifying learned endmember dictionaries for flexible material-based appearance manipulation. Extensive experiments validate our approach, demonstrating superior spectral reconstruction and material segmentation to existing methods. Project page: https://www.factral.co/UnMix-NeRF.

arXiv:2507.03958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as dense retrievers, the impact of their domain-specific specialization on retrieval effectiveness remains underexplored. This investigation systematically examines how task-specific adaptations in LLMs influence their retrieval capabilities, an essential step toward developing unified retrievers capable of handling text, code, images, and multimodal content. We conduct extensive experiments with eight Qwen2.5 7B LLMs, including base, instruction-tuned, code/math-specialized, long reasoning, and vision-language models across zero-shot retrieval settings and the supervised setting. For the zero-shot retrieval settings, we consider text retrieval from the BEIR benchmark and code retrieval from the CoIR benchmark. Further, to evaluate supervised performance, all LLMs are fine-tuned on the MS MARCO dataset. We find that mathematical specialization and the long reasoning capability cause consistent degradation in three settings, indicating conflicts between mathematical reasoning and semantic matching. The vision-language model and code-specialized LLMs demonstrate superior zero-shot performance compared to other LLMs, even surpassing BM25 on the code retrieval task, and maintain comparable performance to base LLMs in supervised settings. These findings suggest promising directions for the unified retrieval task leveraging cross-domain and cross-modal fusion.

Abstract: Recent large-scale Vision Language Action (VLA) models have shown superior performance in robotic manipulation tasks guided by natural language. However, current VLA models suffer from two drawbacks: (i) generation of massive tokens leading to high inference latency and increased training cost, and (ii) insufficient utilization of generated actions resulting in potential performance loss. To address these issues, we develop a training framework to finetune VLA models for generating significantly fewer action tokens with high parallelism, effectively reducing inference latency and training cost. Furthermore, we introduce an inference optimization technique with a novel voting-based ensemble strategy to combine current and previous action predictions, improving the utilization of generated actions and overall performance. Our results demonstrate that we achieve superior performance compared with state-of-the-art VLA models, achieving significantly higher success rates and 39$\times$ faster inference than OpenVLA with 46 Hz throughput on edge platforms, demonstrating practical deployability.

Abstract: Security alignment enables the Large Language Model (LLM) to gain the protection against malicious queries, but various jailbreak attack methods reveal the vulnerability of this security mechanism. Previous studies have isolated LLM jailbreak attacks and defenses. We analyze the security protection mechanism of the LLM, and propose a framework that combines attack and defense. Our method is based on the linearly separable property of LLM intermediate layer embedding, as well as the essence of jailbreak attack, which aims to embed harmful problems and transfer them to the safe area. We utilize generative adversarial network (GAN) to learn the security judgment boundary inside the LLM to achieve efficient jailbreak attack and defense. The experimental results indicate that our method achieves an average jailbreak success rate of 88.85\% across three popular LLMs, while the defense success rate on the state-of-the-art jailbreak dataset reaches an average of 84.17\%. This not only validates the effectiveness of our approach but also sheds light on the internal security mechanisms of LLMs, offering new insights for enhancing model security The code and data are available at https://github.com/NLPGM/CAVGAN.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Model (LLM) agents and multi-agent systems enables remarkable capabilities in natural language processing and generation. However, these systems introduce unprecedented security vulnerabilities that extend beyond traditional content generation attacks to system-level compromise. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the security of LLMs used as reasoning engines within autonomous agents, highlighting how they can be exploited as attack vectors capable of achieving complete computer takeover. We focus on how different attack surfaces and trust boundaries - Direct Prompt Injection, RAG Backdoor, and Inter Agent Trust - can be leveraged to orchestrate such takeovers. We demonstrate that adversaries can effectively coerce popular LLMs (including GPT-4, Claude-4 and Gemini-2.5) into autonomously installing and executing malware on victim machines. Our evaluation of 18 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals an alarming scenario: 94.4% of models succumb to Direct Prompt Injection and 83.3% are vulnerable to the more stealth and evasive RAG Backdoor Attack. Notably, we tested trust boundaries within multi-agent systems, where LLM agents interact and influence each other, and we revealed a critical security flaw: LLMs which successfully resist direct injection or RAG backdoor will execute identical payloads when requested by peer agents. Our findings show that 100.0% of tested LLMs can be compromised through Inter-Agent Trust Exploitation attacks and that every model exhibits context-dependent security behaviors that create exploitable blind spots. Our results also highlight the need to increase awareness and research on the security risks of LLMs, showing a paradigm shift in cybersecurity threats, where AI tools themselves become sophisticated attack vectors.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) is a promising approach for automatically designing neural network architectures. However, the architecture estimation of NAS is computationally expensive and time-consuming because of training multiple architectures from scratch. Although existing zero-shot NAS methods use training-free proxies to accelerate the architecture estimation, their effectiveness, stability, and generality are still lacking. We present a novel training-free estimation proxy called weighted response correlation (WRCor). WRCor utilizes correlation coefficient matrices of responses across different input samples to calculate the proxy scores of estimated architectures, which can measure their expressivity and generalizability. Experimental results on proxy evaluation demonstrate that WRCor and its voting proxies are more efficient estimation strategies than existing proxies. We also apply them with different search strategies in architecture search. Experimental results on architecture search show that our zero-shot NAS algorithm outperforms most existing NAS algorithms in different search spaces. Our NAS algorithm can discover an architecture with a 22.1% test error on the ImageNet-1k dataset within 4 GPU hours. All codes are publicly available at https://github.com/kunjing96/ZSNAS-WRCor.git.

arXiv:2507.15807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), built on powerful language backbones, have enabled Multimodal In-Context Learning (MICL)-adapting to new tasks from a few multimodal demonstrations consisting of images, questions, and answers. Despite showing noticeable improvement on standard vision-language datasets, current MLLMs struggle to leverage visual information in the demonstrations. Specifically, they tend to neglect visual cues and over-rely on textual patterns, leading to mere text imitation rather than genuine multimodal adaptation. This behavior makes MICL still unimodal and largely restricts its practical utility. More importantly, this limitation is often concealed by the improved performance on tasks that do not require understanding the visual context. As a result, how to effectively enhance MICL ability and reliably evaluate the MICL performance remains underexplored. To address these issues, we first introduce Dynamic Attention Reallocation (DARA), an efficient fine-tuning strategy that encourages models to attend to the visual context by rebalancing attention across visual and textual tokens. In addition, we present TrueMICL, an MICL-dedicated dataset with both support and test sets that explicitly requires the integration of multimodal information-particularly visual content-for correct task completion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our holistic solution, showcasing substantial improvements in the true multimodal in-context learning capabilities.

Abstract: Even state-of-the-art speaker diarization systems exhibit high variance in error rates across different datasets, representing numerous use cases and domains. Furthermore, comparing across systems requires careful application of best practices such as dataset splits and metric definitions to allow for apples-to-apples comparison. We propose SDBench (Speaker Diarization Benchmark), an open-source benchmark suite that integrates 13 diverse datasets with built-in tooling for consistent and fine-grained analysis of speaker diarization performance for various on-device and server-side systems. SDBench enables reproducible evaluation and easy integration of new systems over time. To demonstrate the efficacy of SDBench, we built SpeakerKit, an inference efficiency-focused system built on top of Pyannote v3. SDBench enabled rapid execution of ablation studies that led to SpeakerKit being 9.6x faster than Pyannote v3 while achieving comparable error rates. We benchmark 6 state-of-the-art systems including Deepgram, AWS Transcribe, and Pyannote AI API, revealing important trade-offs between accuracy and speed.

Abstract: Memorization in generative models extends far beyond verbatim text reproduction--it manifests through non-literal patterns, semantic associations, and surprisingly, across modalities in transcript-conditioned generation tasks such as Lyrics-to-Song (L2S) and Text-to-Video (T2V) models. We reveal a new class of cross-modality memorization where models trained on these tasks leak copyrighted content through indirect, phonetic pathways invisible to traditional text-based analysis. In this work, we introduce Adversarial PhoneTic Prompting (APT), an attack that replaces iconic phrases with homophonic alternatives--e.g., "mom's spaghetti" becomes "Bob's confetti"--preserving the acoustic form while largely changing semantic content. We demonstrate that models can be prompted to regurgitate memorized songs using phonetically similar but semantically unrelated lyrics. Despite the semantic drift, black-box models like SUNO and open-source models like YuE generate outputs that are strikingly similar to the original songs--melodically, rhythmically, and vocally--achieving high scores on AudioJudge, CLAP, and CoverID. These effects persist across genres and languages. More surprisingly, we find that phonetic prompts alone can trigger visual memorization in text-to-video models: when given altered lyrics from Lose Yourself, Veo 3 generates scenes that mirror the original music video--complete with a hooded rapper and dim urban settings--despite no explicit visual cues in the prompt. This cross-modality leakage represents an unprecedented threat: models memorize deep, structural patterns that transcend their training modality, making traditional safety measures like copyright filters ineffective. Our findings reveal a fundamental vulnerability in transcript-conditioned generative models and raise urgent concerns around copyright, provenance, and secure deployment of multimodal generation systems.

Abstract: The Transformer, with its scaled dot-product attention mechanism, has become a foundational architecture in modern AI. However, this mechanism is computationally intensive and incurs substantial energy costs. We propose a new Transformer architecture EcoTransformer, in which the output context vector is constructed as the convolution of the values using a Laplacian kernel, where the distances are measured by the L1 metric between the queries and keys. Compared to dot-product based attention, the new attention score calculation is free of matrix multiplication. It performs on par with, or even surpasses, scaled dot-product attention in NLP, bioinformatics, and vision tasks, while consuming significantly less energy.

Abstract: Charts are a fundamental visualization format widely used in data analysis across research and industry. While enabling users to edit charts based on high-level intentions is of great practical value, existing methods primarily rely on natural language instructions, which are often too ambiguous to support fine-grained editing. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for multimodal chart editing, where user intent is expressed through a combination of natural language and visual indicators that explicitly highlight the elements to be modified. To support this paradigm, we present Chart$\text{M}^3$, a new benchmark for Multimodal chart editing with Multi-level complexity and Multi-perspective evaluation. Chart$\text{M}^3$ contains 1,000 samples spanning four levels of editing difficulty. Each sample includes triplets in the form of (chart, code, multimodal instructions). To comprehensively evaluate chart editing models, Chart$\text{M}^3$ provides metrics that assess both visual appearance and code correctness. Our benchmark reveals significant limitations in current multimodal large language models (MLLMs), including GPT-4o, particularly in their ability to interpret and act on visual indicators. To address this, we construct Chart$\text{M}^3$-Train, a large-scale training set with 24,000 multimodal chart editing samples. Fine-tuning MLLMs on this dataset leads to substantial improvements, demonstrating the importance of multimodal supervision in building practical chart editing systems.

<title>NCCR: to Evaluate the Robustness of Neural Networks and Adversarial Examples</title>

Abstract: Neural networks have received a lot of attention recently, and related security issues have come with it. Many studies have shown that neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples that have been artificially perturbed with modification, which is too small to be distinguishable by human perception. Different attacks and defenses have been proposed to solve these problems, but there is little research on evaluating the robustness of neural networks and their inputs. In this work, we propose a metric called the neuron cover change rate (NCCR) to measure the ability of deep learning models to resist attacks and the stability of adversarial examples. NCCR monitors alterations in the output of specifically chosen neurons when the input is perturbed, and networks with a smaller degree of variation are considered to be more robust. The results of the experiment on image recognition and the speaker recognition model show that our metrics can provide a good assessment of the robustness of neural networks or their inputs. It can also be used to detect whether an input is adversarial or not, as adversarial examples are always less robust.

Abstract: Vision large language models (VLLMs) are focusing primarily on handling complex and fine-grained visual information by incorporating advanced vision encoders and scaling up visual models. However, these approaches face high training and inference costs, as well as challenges in extracting visual details, effectively bridging across modalities. In this work, we propose a novel visual framework, MoCHA, to address these issues. Our framework integrates four vision backbones (i.e., CLIP, SigLIP, DINOv2 and ConvNeXt) to extract complementary visual features and is equipped with a sparse Mixture of Experts Connectors (MoECs) module to dynamically select experts tailored to different visual dimensions. To mitigate redundant or insufficient use of the visual information encoded by the MoECs module, we further design a Hierarchical Group Attention (HGA) with intra- and inter-group operations and an adaptive gating strategy for encoded visual features. We train MoCHA on two mainstream LLMs (e.g., Phi2-2.7B and Vicuna-7B) and evaluate their performance across various benchmarks. Notably, MoCHA outperforms state-of-the-art open-weight models on various tasks. For example, compared to CuMo (Mistral-7B), our MoCHA (Phi2-2.7B) presents outstanding abilities to mitigate hallucination by showing improvements of 3.25% in POPE and to follow visual instructions by raising 153 points on MME. Finally, ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed MoECs and HGA in improving the overall performance of MoCHA.

<div> Autonomous cars, XYZ-Drive model, vision-language integration, goal-centered attention, MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark

Summary:
XYZ-Drive is a vision-language model that integrates geometric accuracy and semantic understanding for autonomous driving tasks. It uses a goal-centered cross-attention layer to fuse information from front-camera frames, overhead maps, and waypoint tokens to generate steering and speed commands. The model outperforms existing methods on the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark, achieving high success rates and efficiency. Ablations show the importance of integrating vision, waypoint, and map modalities, as well as the benefits of fine-tuning the transformer model. The study highlights the significance of early, token-level fusion of intent and map layout for accurate, transparent, and real-time driving. Coarsening map resolution negatively impacts performance, indicating the importance of maintaining detailed map information for safe navigation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous cars need geometric accuracy and semantic understanding to navigate complex environments, yet most stacks handle them separately. We present XYZ-Drive, a single vision-language model that reads a front-camera frame, a 25m $\times$ 25m overhead map, and the next waypoint, then outputs steering and speed. A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model.
  On the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark XYZ-Drive attains 95% success and 0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality (vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion injects map knowledge more effectively. Keeping the transformer frozen loses 5%, showing the importance of fine-tuning when applying VLMs for specific tasks such as autonomous driving. Coarsening map resolution from 10 cm to 40 cm blurs lane edges and raises crash rate.
  Overall, these results demonstrate that early, token-level fusion of intent and map layout enables accurate, transparent, real-time driving.

Abstract: We present SMART-Editor, a framework for compositional layout and content editing across structured (posters, websites) and unstructured (natural images) domains. Unlike prior models that perform local edits, SMART-Editor preserves global coherence through two strategies: Reward-Refine, an inference-time rewardguided refinement method, and RewardDPO, a training-time preference optimization approach using reward-aligned layout pairs. To evaluate model performance, we introduce SMARTEdit-Bench, a benchmark covering multi-domain, cascading edit scenarios. SMART-Editor outperforms strong baselines like InstructPix2Pix and HIVE, with RewardDPO achieving up to 15% gains in structured settings and Reward-Refine showing advantages on natural images. Automatic and human evaluations confirm the value of reward-guided planning in producing semantically consistent and visually aligned edits.

<div> Efficiency, effectiveness, trade-off, Large Language Model, agent framework <br />
Summary:<br />
This study examines the trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness in modern agent systems, focusing on the cost-effective design of agents without compromising performance. Three key questions are explored: the inherent complexity of agentic tasks, the point of diminishing returns on additional modules, and the efficiency gains achievable through agent framework design. Through analysis on the GAIA benchmark, the study evaluates the impact of LLM backbone selection, agent framework designs, and test-time scaling strategies on the cost-of-pass metric. The findings lead to the development of Efficient Agents, a new framework that balances complexity and task requirements, achieving a notable 28.4% improvement in cost-of-pass compared to leading frameworks. This work provides practical guidance for designing efficient and high-performing agent systems, promoting the accessibility and sustainability of AI solutions.<br /> <div>

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents have enabled sophisticated systems to tackle complex, multi-step tasks, but their escalating costs threaten scalability and accessibility. This work presents the first systematic study of the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off in modern agent systems, addressing the critical need for cost-effective designs without sacrificing performance. We investigate three key questions: (1) How much complexity do agentic tasks inherently require? (2) When do additional modules yield diminishing returns? (3) How much efficiency can be gained through the design of efficient agent frameworks? Through an empirical analysis on the GAIA benchmark, we evaluate the impact of LLM backbone selection, agent framework designs, and test-time scaling strategies. Using the cost-of-pass metric, we quantify the efficiency-performance trade-off across these dimensions. Our findings inform the development of Efficient Agents , a novel agent framework that has an optimal complexity to task requirements. Efficient Agents retains 96.7% of the performance of OWL, one leading open-source agent framework, while reducing operational costs from $0.398 to $0.228, resulting in a 28.4% improvement in cost-of-pass. Our work provides actionable insights for designing efficient, high-performing agent systems, advancing the accessibility and sustainability of AI-driven solutions.

<div> planning, conformant planning, Domain Closure Assumption, first-order logic, bounded planning<br />
Summary:
This article challenges the Domain Closure Assumption in traditional planning models by allowing dynamic changes in the set of objects during action execution. It formulates the planning problem in first-order logic and discusses the finiteness of possible actions in each situation. By proposing a finite integer bound on plan length and organizing search over grounded action sequences, the approach ensures soundness and completeness. This method addresses bounded planning problems without the Domain Closure Assumption, falling within the intersection of sequential generalized planning and conformant planning. The implementation of the planner demonstrates a proof-of-concept for this novel approach. <div>
arXiv:2508.02697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In classical planning and conformant planning, it is assumed that there are finitely many named objects given in advance, and only they can participate in actions and in fluents. This is the Domain Closure Assumption (DCA). However, there are practical planning problems where the set of objects changes dynamically as actions are performed; e.g., new objects can be created, old objects can be destroyed. We formulate the planning problem in first-order logic, assume an initial theory is a finite consistent set of fluent literals, discuss when this guarantees that in every situation there are only finitely many possible actions, impose a finite integer bound on the length of the plan, and propose to organize search over sequences of actions that are grounded at planning time. We show the soundness and completeness of our approach. It can be used to solve the bounded planning problems without DCA that belong to the intersection of sequential generalized planning (without sensing actions) and conformant planning, restricted to the case without the disjunction over fluent literals. We discuss a proof-of-the-concept implementation of our planner.

Summary: 
The study addresses the problem of incomplete trip and activity sequences in Location-Based Service (LBS) data and proposes a solution called VSNIT. VSNIT combines the flexibility of the Insertion Transformer with the dynamic covariate handling capability of the Variable Selection Network to recover missing segments in activity sequences at the individual level. The results show that VSNIT generates more diverse and realistic activity patterns, improves activity transitions, and outperforms baseline models in accuracy and diversity metrics. This approach has the potential to enhance the utility of LBS data for mobility analysis and offers a promising framework for future research and applications. <div>
arXiv:2508.02734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Location-Based Service (LBS) data provides critical insights into human mobility, yet its sparsity often yields incomplete trip and activity sequences, making accurate inferences about trips and activities difficult. We raise a research problem: Can we use activity sequences derived from high-quality LBS data to recover incomplete activity sequences at the individual level? This study proposes a new solution, the Variable Selection Network-fused Insertion Transformer (VSNIT), integrating the Insertion Transformer's flexible sequence construction with the Variable Selection Network's dynamic covariate handling capability, to recover missing segments in incomplete activity sequences while preserving existing data. The findings show that VSNIT inserts more diverse, realistic activity patterns, more closely matching real-world variability, and restores disrupted activity transitions more effectively aligning with the target. It also performs significantly better than the baseline model across all metrics. These results highlight VSNIT's superior accuracy and diversity in activity sequence recovery tasks, demonstrating its potential to enhance LBS data utility for mobility analysis. This approach offers a promising framework for future location-based research and applications.

<div> Keywords: artificial intelligence, scientific discovery, reasoning models, cognitive loop, in-situ optimization

Summary: 
The article introduces a new approach called a cognitive loop via in-situ optimization (CLIO) that allows for deep control over the reasoning process in artificial intelligence (AI). This approach enables large language models (LLMs) to formulate problem-solving strategies, adapt behavior based on confidence levels, and provide scientists with final answers. It offers transparency and steerability in AI reasoning, allowing scientists to observe uncertainty levels, understand belief formation using graph structures, and make corrections. The use of CLIO with OpenAI's GPT-4.1 significantly improves accuracy in text-based biology and medicine questions, surpassing previous models' performance. The study also highlights the importance of internal uncertainty measures in determining the accuracy of CLIO's results, demonstrating how its open design can enhance scientific decision-making processes. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.02789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capacity for artificial intelligence (AI) to formulate, evolve, and test altered thought patterns under dynamic conditions indicates advanced cognition that is crucial for scientific discovery. The existing AI development landscape falls into two categories: 1) frameworks over non-reasoning models that natively incorporate opinions on how humans think, and 2) reasoning models that abstract precise control of the reasoning intuition away from end users. While powerful, for scientists to maximize utility of AI in scientific discovery, they not only require accuracy and transparency in reasoning, but also steerability. Hence, we introduce an alternative approach that enables deep and precise control over the reasoning process called: a cognitive loop via in-situ optimization (CLIO). CLIO enables large language models (LLMs) to self-formulate ways of approaching a problem, adapt behavior when self-confidence is low, and ultimately provide scientists with a final belief or answer. Through CLIO's open design, scientists can observe uncertainty levels, understand how final belief states are formulated using graph structures, and interject corrections. Without any further post-training, OpenAI's GPT-4.1 with CLIO yields an accuracy of 22.37\% in text-based biology and medicine questions on Humanity's Last Exam (HLE). This yields a 13.82\% net or 161.64\% relative increase when compared to the base GPT-4.1 model and surpasses OpenAI's o3 performance in high and low reasoning effort modes. We further discovered that oscillations within internal uncertainty measures are key in determining the accuracy of CLIO's results, revealing how its open design and internal mechanisms can provide insight and control into scientific decision-making processes.

Abstract: Radiology visual question answering (RVQA) provides precise answers to questions about chest X-ray images, alleviating radiologists' workload. While recent methods based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have shown promising progress in RVQA, they still face challenges in factual accuracy, hallucinations, and cross-modal misalignment. We introduce a multi-agent system (MAS) designed to support complex reasoning in RVQA, with specialized agents for context understanding, multimodal reasoning, and answer validation. We evaluate our system on a challenging RVQA set curated via model disagreement filtering, comprising consistently hard cases across multiple MLLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our system over strong MLLM baselines, with a case study illustrating its reliability and interpretability. This work highlights the potential of multi-agent approaches to support explainable and trustworthy clinical AI applications that require complex reasoning.

<div> Keywords: planning, benchmark, countdown game, computational complexity, LLM-assisted planning

Summary:
In this paper, the authors address the limitations of current planning benchmarks by introducing a new benchmark centered around the game called Countdown. This game involves forming a target number from a list of input numbers through arithmetic operations and is computationally challenging (NP-complete). The authors provide a theoretical analysis, establishing the computational complexity results and demonstrate the advantage of their instance generation procedure over existing benchmarks. They evaluate various LLM-assisted planning methods on instances generated using their procedure and show that their dynamic benchmark is extremely challenging for existing LLM-based approaches. This new benchmark meets the desiderata for an ideal benchmark, including intuitive problem description, computational complexity, and the avoidance of memorization. The results suggest that this benchmark can effectively evaluate planning capabilities in a more robust and challenging manner compared to existing benchmarks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.02900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a broad consensus that the inability to form long-term plans is one of the key limitations of current foundational models and agents. However, the existing planning benchmarks remain woefully inadequate to truly measure their planning capabilities. Most existing benchmarks either focus on loosely defined tasks like travel planning or end up leveraging existing domains and problems from international planning competitions. While the former tasks are hard to formalize and verify, the latter were specifically designed to test and challenge the weaknesses of existing automated planners. To address these shortcomings, we propose a procedure for creating a planning benchmark centered around the game called Countdown, where a player is expected to form a target number from a list of input numbers through arithmetic operations. We discuss how this problem meets many of the desiderata associated with an ideal benchmark for planning capabilities evaluation. Specifically, the domain allows for an intuitive, natural language description for each problem instance, it is computationally challenging (NP-complete), and the instance space is rich enough that we do not have to worry about memorization. We perform an extensive theoretical analysis, establishing the computational complexity result and demonstrate the advantage of our instance generation procedure over public benchmarks. We evaluate a variety of existing LLM-assisted planning methods on instances generated using our procedure. Our results show that, unlike other domains like 24 Game (a special case of Countdown), our proposed dynamic benchmark remains extremely challenging for existing LLM-based approaches.

Summary:
Post-training methods have proven to enhance the performance and reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs). However, applying these methods to Japanese LLMs has been challenging due to resource constraints. Drawing inspiration from task vectors used to extract weight changes before and after training for specific tasks, this study introduces reasoning vectors from reasoning LLMs to boost Japanese LLMs' performance. Despite resource limitations, a simple and effective approach is proposed to improve Japanese LLMs significantly. This method aims to serve as a model for enhancing performance in other languages as well.

While the resources available present a challenge to improve Japanese LLMs, we present a simple and effective way to obtain high improvement and hope to inspire for other languages.

Summary: PentestJudge is a system that uses a large language model to evaluate the operations of penetration testing agents. It employs rubrics with a hierarchical structure to break down tasks into smaller criteria for evaluation. The model's performance is compared to human experts, with the best model achieving an F1 score of 0.83. Models proficient in tool-use tend to perform closer to human experts. The study reveals that models with similar overall scores may struggle with different types of questions, suggesting varying abilities in judging operating criteria. Weaker models can effectively judge the actions of stronger models, indicating that verification may be simpler than generating actions in penetration testing. This methodology aims to support research in assessing the quality of AI-based security agents, enabling their safe deployment in sensitive environments. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.02921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce PentestJudge, a system for evaluating the operations of penetration testing agents. PentestJudge is a large language model (LLM)-as-judge with access to tools that allow it to consume arbitrary trajectories of agent states and tool call history to determine whether a security agent's actions meet certain operating criteria that would be impractical to evaluate programmatically. We develop rubrics that use a tree structure to hierarchically collapse the penetration testing task for a particular environment into smaller, simpler, and more manageable sub-tasks and criteria until each leaf node represents simple yes-or-no criteria for PentestJudge to evaluate. Task nodes are broken down into different categories related to operational objectives, operational security, and tradecraft. LLM-as-judge scores are compared to human domain experts as a ground-truth reference, allowing us to compare their relative performance with standard binary classification metrics, such as F1 scores. We evaluate several frontier and open-source models acting as judge agents, with the best model reaching an F1 score of 0.83. We find models that are better at tool-use perform more closely to human experts. By stratifying the F1 scores by requirement type, we find even models with similar overall scores struggle with different types of questions, suggesting certain models may be better judges of particular operating criteria. We find that weaker and cheaper models can judge the trajectories of pentests performed by stronger and more expensive models, suggesting verification may be easier than generation for the penetration testing task. We share this methodology to facilitate future research in understanding the ability of judges to holistically and scalably evaluate the process quality of AI-based information security agents so that they may be confidently used in sensitive production environments.

<div> Keywords: hydrologic modeling, language-based agent, vision-enabled, simulation, U.S. basins

Summary: 
AQUAH is an innovative language-based agent designed for hydrologic modeling that can autonomously perform simulations based on natural-language prompts. The agent retrieves necessary data, configures a hydrologic model, runs simulations, and generates reports without manual intervention. It utilizes vision-enabled large language models to interpret maps and make key decisions for the simulation. Initial experiments in various U.S. basins have shown that AQUAH produces clear, transparent, and physically plausible results, which are deemed analyst-ready by hydrologists. While further calibration and validation are required for operational use, the success of AQUAH demonstrates the potential of leveraging language models and vision technology to streamline complex environmental modeling processes, bridging the gap between Earth observation data and decision makers. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.02936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce AQUAH, the first end-to-end language-based agent designed specifically for hydrologic modeling. Starting from a simple natural-language prompt (e.g., 'simulate floods for the Little Bighorn basin from 2020 to 2022'), AQUAH autonomously retrieves the required terrain, forcing, and gauge data; configures a hydrologic model; runs the simulation; and generates a self-contained PDF report. The workflow is driven by vision-enabled large language models, which interpret maps and rasters on the fly and steer key decisions such as outlet selection, parameter initialization, and uncertainty commentary. Initial experiments across a range of U.S. basins show that AQUAH can complete cold-start simulations and produce analyst-ready documentation without manual intervention. The results are judged by hydrologists as clear, transparent, and physically plausible. While further calibration and validation are still needed for operational deployment, these early outcomes highlight the promise of LLM-centered, vision-grounded agents to streamline complex environmental modeling and lower the barrier between Earth observation data, physics-based tools, and decision makers.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal language models, clinical decision support, diagnostic reasoning, medical image interpretation, perceptual abilities

Summary: 
Multimodal language models (MLMs) have shown potential for clinical decision support and diagnostic reasoning in the medical field. However, the adoption of AI tools by clinicians is selective, and models that make errors on simple perception tasks are unlikely to be accepted for clinical use. To address this issue, the Medblink benchmark was created to evaluate MLMs on perceptual tasks related to medical imaging. The benchmark includes eight tasks across various modalities and anatomical regions, with a total of 1,429 multiple-choice questions. Evaluation of 19 state-of-the-art MLMs revealed that while human annotators achieved high accuracy, the best-performing model only reached 65%. These results highlight the need to improve the visual grounding of MLMs to support their adoption in clinical settings. The data for the benchmark is available on the project's webpage.

Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLMs) show promise for clinical decision support and diagnostic reasoning, raising the prospect of end-to-end automated medical image interpretation. However, clinicians are highly selective in adopting AI tools; a model that makes errors on seemingly simple perception tasks such as determining image orientation or identifying whether a CT scan is contrast-enhance are unlikely to be adopted for clinical tasks. We introduce Medblink, a benchmark designed to probe these models for such perceptual abilities. Medblink spans eight clinically meaningful tasks across multiple imaging modalities and anatomical regions, totaling 1,429 multiple-choice questions over 1,605 images. We evaluate 19 state-of-the-art MLMs, including general purpose (GPT4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) and domain specific (Med Flamingo, LLaVA Med, RadFM) models. While human annotators achieve 96.4% accuracy, the best-performing model reaches only 65%. These results show that current MLMs frequently fail at routine perceptual checks, suggesting the need to strengthen their visual grounding to support clinical adoption. Data is available on our project page.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at solving complex tasks by executing agentic workflows composed of detailed instructions and structured operations. Yet, building general-purpose agents by manually embedding foundation models into agentic systems such as Chain-of-Thought, Self-Reflection, and ReACT through text interfaces limits scalability and efficiency. Recently, many researchers have sought to automate the generation and optimization of these workflows through code-based representations. However, existing methods often rely on labeled datasets to train and optimize workflows, making them ineffective and inflexible for solving real-world, dynamic problems where labeled data is unavailable. To address this challenge, we introduce Polymath, a self-optimizing agent with dynamic hierarchical workflow that leverages the flexibility of task flow graphs and the expressiveness of code-represented workflows to solve a wide range of real-world, dynamic problems. The proposed optimization methodology integrates multi-grid-inspired graph optimization with a self-reflection-guided evolutionary algorithm to refine workflows without labeled data. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets across coding, math, and multi-turn QA tasks show that Polymath achieves 8.1% average improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel self-consciousness defense mechanism for Large Language Models (LLMs) to combat prompt injection attacks. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on external classifiers, our method leverages the LLM's inherent reasoning capabilities to perform self-protection. We propose a framework that incorporates Meta-Cognitive and Arbitration Modules, enabling LLMs to evaluate and regulate their own outputs autonomously. Our approach is evaluated on seven state-of-the-art LLMs using two datasets: AdvBench and Prompt-Injection-Mixed-Techniques-2024. Experiment results demonstrate significant improvements in defense success rates across models and datasets, with some achieving perfect and near-perfect defense in Enhanced Mode. We also analyze the trade-off between defense success rate improvement and computational overhead. This self-consciousness method offers a lightweight, cost-effective solution for enhancing LLM ethics, particularly beneficial for GenAI use cases across various platforms.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in capability and autonomy, evaluating their outputs-especially in open-ended and complex tasks-has become a critical bottleneck. A new paradigm is emerging: using AI agents as the evaluators themselves. This "agent-as-a-judge" approach leverages the reasoning and perspective-taking abilities of LLMs to assess the quality and safety of other models, promising calable and nuanced alternatives to human evaluation. In this review, we define the agent-as-a-judge concept, trace its evolution from single-model judges to dynamic multi-agent debate frameworks, and critically examine their strengths and shortcomings. We compare these approaches across reliability, cost, and human alignment, and survey real-world deployments in domains such as medicine, law, finance, and education. Finally, we highlight pressing challenges-including bias, robustness, and meta evaluation-and outline future research directions. By bringing together these strands, our review demonstrates how agent-based judging can complement (but not replace) human oversight, marking a step toward trustworthy, scalable evaluation for next-generation LLMs.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces a new framework, BPO, to address challenges in applying Large Language Reasoning Models to multi-round agentic planning in interactive environments. The framework consists of three stages: bootstrapping, extrapolation, and refinement. It aims to overcome the intractable credit assignment problem in sparse-reward settings and reduce the computational overhead of verbose reasoning histories. By utilizing planning quaternions and chain-of-thought fusion, BPO bootstraps efficient reasoning and extrapolates to out-of-distribution tasks through curriculum learning. The model further refines itself by learning exclusively on experiences selected via reward-gated rejection sampling. Experimental results on various environments show that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant token efficiency, providing a promising strategy for developing reasoning models in agentic planning. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Reasoning Models have demonstrated remarkable success on static tasks, yet their application to multi-round agentic planning in interactive environments faces two fundamental challenges. First, the intractable credit assignment problem renders conventional reinforcement learning ineffective in sparse-reward settings. Second, the computational overhead of verbose, step-by-step reasoning histories is prohibitive. To address these challenges, we propose BPO, a three-stage framework (bootstrapping, extrapolation, and refinement) that establishes a self-improving data flywheel to develop robust reasoning models for long-horizon, sparse-reward environments. Our framework first bootstraps efficient reasoning using the proposed planning quaternions with long-short chain-of-thought fusion. It then extrapolates to out-of-distribution tasks through complexity-stratified curriculum learning. Finally, the model iteratively refines itself by learning exclusively on experiences selected via reward-gated rejection sampling. Experiments on ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, and WebShop demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art with significant token efficiency, providing a new recipe for reasoning models in agentic planning.

Summary: 
Collab-Solver introduces a multi-agent-based policy learning framework that collaboratively optimizes policies for multiple modules in Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solvers. By formulating the collaboration of cut selection and branching as a Stackelberg game, the framework addresses the interdependence of policy learning modules. A two-phase learning paradigm is employed to stabilize collaborative policy learning, with the first phase focusing on data-communicated policy pretraining and the second phase orchestrating policy learning for various modules. The jointly learned policy enhances solving performance on synthetic and real-world MILP datasets and exhibits excellent generalization capabilities across different instance sets. This approach represents a significant improvement over existing methods, which often treat policy learning in MILP solvers independently, resulting in reduced solving speed and quality.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.03030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) has been a fundamental problem in combinatorial optimization. Previous works have designed a plethora of hard-coded heuristics to accomplish challenging MILP solving with domain knowledge. Driven by the high capability of neural networks, recent research is devoted to replacing manually designed heuristics with learned policies. Although learning-based MILP methods have shown great promise, existing worksindependentlytreatthepolicylearningineachmoduleofMILPsolvers without considering their interdependence, severely hurting the solving speed and quality. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-agent-based policy learning framework for MILP (Collab-Solver), which can collaboratively optimize the policies for multiple modules. Specifically, we formulate the collaboration of cut selection and branching in MILP solving as a Stackelberg game. Under this formulation, we develop a two-phase learning paradigm to stabilize the collaborative policy learning, where the first phase achieves the data-communicated policy pretraining and the second phase further orchestrates the policy learning for various modules. The jointly learned policy significantly improves the solving performance on both synthetic and large-scale real-world MILP datasets. Moreover, the policies learned by Collab-Solver have also demonstrated excellent generalization abilities across different instance sets.

Summary: 
In this paper, the authors explore the use of In-Context Learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs) to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs). By conditioning on examples embedded in prompts, the LLMs, specifically GPT-2 models, demonstrate the ability to learn a meta-ODE algorithm effectively. The experiments conducted show that GPT-2 can solve ODE problems with convergence behavior comparable to or better than the Euler method. Additionally, the model exhibits exponential accuracy gains as the number of demonstrations increases and showcases robust extrapolation capabilities to out-of-distribution (OOD) problems. These findings offer insights into the mechanisms of ICL in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and highlight its potential in solving nonlinear numerical problems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as a new paradigm in large language models (LLMs), enabling them to perform novel tasks by conditioning on a few examples embedded in the prompt. Yet, the highly nonlinear behavior of ICL for NLP tasks remains poorly understood. To shed light on its underlying mechanisms, this paper investigates whether LLMs can solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs) under the ICL setting. We formulate standard ODE problems and their solutions as sequential prompts and evaluate GPT-2 models on these tasks. Experiments on two types of ODEs show that GPT-2 can effectively learn a meta-ODE algorithm, with convergence behavior comparable to, or better than, the Euler method, and achieve exponential accuracy gains with increasing numbers of demonstrations. Moreover, the model generalizes to out-of-distribution (OOD) problems, demonstrating robust extrapolation capabilities. These empirical findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of ICL in NLP and its potential for solving nonlinear numerical problems.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel multi-agent framework called Tree-of-Reasoning (ToR) to address the limitations of existing large language models (LLMs) in complex medical diagnosis tasks. The framework utilizes a tree structure to capture the reasoning path of LLMs and clinical evidence, leading to improved diagnostic accuracy in the medical domain. Additionally, a cross-validation mechanism is proposed to enhance the consistency of decision-making among the multi-agents, thereby enhancing their clinical reasoning capabilities in complex medical scenarios. Experimental results on real-world medical data demonstrate that the ToR framework outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of diagnostic performance. This innovative approach aims to overcome the challenges faced by current LLMs in processing specialized medical data effectively and accurately.

arXiv:2508.03038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in the medical domain. However, existing models still fall short when faced with complex medical diagnosis task in the real world. This is mainly because they lack sufficient reasoning depth, which leads to information loss or logical jumps when processing a large amount of specialized medical data, leading to diagnostic errors. To address these challenges, we propose Tree-of-Reasoning (ToR), a novel multi-agent framework designed to handle complex scenarios. Specifically, ToR introduces a tree structure that can clearly record the reasoning path of LLMs and the corresponding clinical evidence. At the same time, we propose a cross-validation mechanism to ensure the consistency of multi-agent decision-making, thereby improving the clinical reasoning ability of multi-agents in complex medical scenarios. Experimental results on real-world medical data show that our framework can achieve better performance than existing baseline methods.

<div> Keywords: large language models, jailbreak attacks, Cognitive-Driven Defense, meta-operations, entropy-guided reinforcement learning <br />
Summary: <br />
Defending large language models (LLMs) against jailbreak attacks is crucial for their secure deployment. Existing defense mechanisms often struggle to adapt to new and unseen attack strategies. To address this issue, the Cognitive-Driven Defense (CDD) framework is proposed, which focuses on the underlying structure of jailbreak prompts by using meta-operations to conceal harmful intent. CDD mimics human cognitive reasoning through a structured reasoning chain, starting with a global perception of the prompt and then analyzing localized manipulations. Through supervised fine-tuning and entropy-guided reinforcement learning, CDD learns to identify and reason about known manipulation patterns while also exploring new types and variants of meta-operations for enhanced generalization to unseen threats. Experimental results show that CDD achieves superior defense performance and robust generalization to unfamiliar jailbreak attacks. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Defending large language models (LLMs) against jailbreak attacks is essential for their safe and reliable deployment. Existing defenses often rely on shallow pattern matching, which struggles to generalize to novel and unseen attack strategies. To address this challenge, we propose the Cognitive-Driven Defense (CDD) framework, which targets the underlying structure of jailbreak prompts by applying meta-operations, defined as basic manipulations that conceal harmful intent.CDD emulates human cognitive reasoning through a structured reasoning chain. It begins with a global perception of the prompt and follows with a localized analysis to uncover hidden manipulations. By applying supervised fine-tuning on this structured chain, the model learns to identify and reason about known manipulation patterns. To enhance generalization to unseen threats, an entropy-guided reinforcement learning algorithm (EG-GRPO) is introduced to encourage exploration of new types and variants of meta-operations. Experiments demonstrate that CDD can achieve state-of-the-art defense performance and exhibit strong generalization to unseen jailbreak attacks.

<div> Keywords: large language models, legal risk analysis, open-source, ContractEval, CUAD

Summary:<br /><br />Proprietary language models outperform open-source models in correctness and effectiveness for identifying legal risks in contracts. Larger open-source models perform better, although performance improvement slows with increased size. Reasoning mode enhances output effectiveness but diminishes correctness due to complex task handling. Open-source models exhibit higher "no related clause" responses, possibly indicating a lack of deep thinking or confidence in extracting relevant content. Model quantization accelerates inference but reduces performance, emphasizing the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. These findings indicate that open-source language models may require specific fine-tuning for accurate and effective performance in legal contexts. The ContractEval benchmark provides valuable insights for future development of legal-oriented language models.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.03080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential of large language models (LLMs) in specialized domains such as legal risk analysis remains underexplored. In response to growing interest in locally deploying open-source LLMs for legal tasks while preserving data confidentiality, this paper introduces ContractEval, the first benchmark to thoroughly evaluate whether open-source LLMs could match proprietary LLMs in identifying clause-level legal risks in commercial contracts. Using the Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD), we assess 4 proprietary and 15 open-source LLMs. Our results highlight five key findings: (1) Proprietary models outperform open-source models in both correctness and output effectiveness, though some open-source models are competitive in certain specific dimensions. (2) Larger open-source models generally perform better, though the improvement slows down as models get bigger. (3) Reasoning ("thinking") mode improves output effectiveness but reduces correctness, likely due to over-complicating simpler tasks. (4) Open-source models generate "no related clause" responses more frequently even when relevant clauses are present. This suggests "laziness" in thinking or low confidence in extracting relevant content. (5) Model quantization speeds up inference but at the cost of performance drop, showing the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. These findings suggest that while most LLMs perform at a level comparable to junior legal assistants, open-source models require targeted fine-tuning to ensure correctness and effectiveness in high-stakes legal settings. ContractEval offers a solid benchmark to guide future development of legal-domain LLMs.

Summary: 
Automated Heuristic Design (AHD) has seen success but struggles with generalization. Automated Heuristic Set Design (AHSD) is introduced to generate a small, diverse set of complementary heuristics for different problem instances. The AHSD objective function is shown to be monotone and supermodular. Evolution of Heuristic Set (EoH-S) implements AHSD for LLM-driven AHD, utilizing complementary population management and complementary-aware memetic search. EoH-S outperforms existing methods, achieving up to 60% performance improvements across various tasks and instances. <div>

Abstract: Automated Heuristic Design (AHD) using Large Language Models (LLMs) has achieved notable success in recent years. Despite the effectiveness of existing approaches, they only design a single heuristic to serve all problem instances, often inducing poor generalization across different distributions or settings. To address this issue, we propose Automated Heuristic Set Design (AHSD), a new formulation for LLM-driven AHD. The aim of AHSD is to automatically generate a small-sized complementary heuristic set to serve diverse problem instances, such that each problem instance could be optimized by at least one heuristic in this set. We show that the objective function of AHSD is monotone and supermodular. Then, we propose Evolution of Heuristic Set (EoH-S) to apply the AHSD formulation for LLM-driven AHD. With two novel mechanisms of complementary population management and complementary-aware memetic search, EoH-S could effectively generate a set of high-quality and complementary heuristics. Comprehensive experimental results on three AHD tasks with diverse instances spanning various sizes and distributions demonstrate that EoH-S consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art AHD methods and achieves up to 60\% performance improvements.

Summary: 
Diffusion models are useful for imputing missing data by modeling observed and unobserved variables jointly. Current methods, like stochastic denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), have drawbacks such as high inference latency and variable outputs. These limitations hinder their practical use in real-world tabular scenarios. To overcome these issues, MissDDIM introduces a conditional diffusion framework that utilizes Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for tabular imputation. While stochastic sampling allows for diverse completions, it also leads to output variability, making downstream processing more complex. The proposed framework aims to address these challenges and enhance the applicability of diffusion models for tabular data imputation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

<div> Keywords: CLIP, unlearnable examples, data protection, privacy, text-to-image (T2I) model

Summary:   
Unlearnable Examples (UEs) are used as a countermeasure to unauthorized model training in large-scale pre-training frameworks like CLIP. However, the current approaches of generating UEs through joint optimization of noise for images and text descriptions pose privacy concerns as they rely on external services. To address this, the Text-to-Unlearnable Example (T2UE) framework is introduced, allowing users to generate UEs using only text descriptions, eliminating the need for original image data exposure. T2UE leverages a text-to-image model and an error-minimization framework to create effective unlearnable noise. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of T2UE in degrading performance in downstream tasks for various models, showcasing its data protection capabilities. This zero-contact data protection approach highlights the feasibility of safeguarding personal data solely based on textual descriptions, paving the way for practical and scalable privacy-preserving solutions.

Abstract: Large-scale pre-training frameworks like CLIP have revolutionized multimodal learning, but their reliance on web-scraped datasets, frequently containing private user data, raises serious concerns about misuse. Unlearnable Examples (UEs) have emerged as a promising countermeasure against unauthorized model training, employing carefully crafted unlearnable noise to disrupt the learning of meaningful representations from protected data. Current approaches typically generate UEs by jointly optimizing unlearnable noise for both images and their associated text descriptions (or labels). However, this optimization process is often computationally prohibitive for on-device execution, forcing reliance on external third-party services. This creates a fundamental privacy paradox: users must initially expose their data to these very services to achieve protection, thereby compromising privacy in the process. Such a contradiction has severely hindered the development of practical, scalable data protection solutions. To resolve this paradox, we introduce \textbf{Text-to-Unlearnable Example (T2UE)}, a novel framework that enables users to generate UEs using only text descriptions. T2UE circumvents the need for original image data by employing a text-to-image (T2I) model to map text descriptions into the image (noise) space, combined with an error-minimization framework to produce effective unlearnable noise. Extensive experiments show that T2UE-protected data substantially degrades performance in downstream tasks (e.g., cross-modal retrieval) for state-of-the-art models. Notably, the protective effect generalizes across diverse architectures and even to supervised learning settings. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of "zero-contact data protection", where personal data can be safeguarded based solely on their textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct data exposure.

Abstract: With the proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs), the detection of misinformation has become increasingly important and complex. This research proposes an innovative verifiable misinformation detection LLM agent that goes beyond traditional true/false binary judgments. The agent actively verifies claims through dynamic interaction with diverse web sources, assesses information source credibility, synthesizes evidence, and provides a complete verifiable reasoning process. Our designed agent architecture includes three core tools: precise web search tool, source credibility assessment tool and numerical claim verification tool. These tools enable the agent to execute multi-step verification strategies, maintain evidence logs, and form comprehensive assessment conclusions. We evaluate using standard misinformation datasets such as FakeNewsNet, comparing with traditional machine learning models and LLMs. Evaluation metrics include standard classification metrics, quality assessment of reasoning processes, and robustness testing against rewritten content. Experimental results show that our agent outperforms baseline methods in misinformation detection accuracy, reasoning transparency, and resistance to information rewriting, providing a new paradigm for trustworthy AI-assisted fact-checking.

<div> Keywords: Generative agent models, smart education, communication modes, LLM, diversity indices

Summary:
AgentSME is a generative agent framework for smart education using LLM technology. It considers three communication modes - Solo, Mono, and Echo - to capture different levels of agency autonomy and communicative reciprocity. The framework is evaluated based on accuracy and diversity of reasoning contents across six LLM models in base and high-capacity configurations. Results show that agents using the Echo communication mode achieve highest accuracy scores, with DeepSeek exhibiting the most diversity. This study highlights the importance of communication modes in improving agent learning capabilities for personalized human-to-human communication in educational contexts. <div>

Abstract: Generative agent models specifically tailored for smart education are critical, yet remain relatively underdeveloped. A key challenge stems from the inherent complexity of educational contexts: learners are human beings with various cognitive behaviors, and pedagogy is fundamentally centered on personalized human-to-human communication. To address this issue, this paper proposes AgentSME, a unified generative agent framework powered by LLM. Three directional communication modes are considered in the models, namely Solo, Mono, and Echo, reflecting different types of agency autonomy and communicative reciprocity. Accuracy is adopted as the primary evaluation metric, complemented by three diversity indices designed to assess the diversity of reasoning contents. Six widely used LLMs are tested to validate the robustness of communication modes across different model tiers, which are equally divided into base-capacity and high-capacity configurations. The results show that generative agents that employ the Echo communication mode achieve the highest accuracy scores, while DeepSeek exhibits the greatest diversity. This study provides valuable information to improve agent learning capabilities and inspire smart education models.

Abstract: We present a framework for training trustworthy large language model (LLM) agents for optimization modeling via a verifiable synthetic data generation pipeline. Focusing on linear and mixed-integer linear programming, our approach begins with structured symbolic representations and systematically produces natural language descriptions, mathematical formulations, and solver-executable code. By programmatically constructing each instance with known optimal solutions, the pipeline ensures full verifiability and enables automatic filtering of low-quality demonstrations generated by teacher models. Each dataset instance includes a structured representation of the optimization problem, a corresponding natural language description, the verified optimal solution, and step-by-step demonstrations - generated by a teacher model - that show how to model and solve the problem across multiple optimization modeling languages. This enables supervised fine-tuning of open-source LLMs specifically tailored to optimization tasks. To operationalize this pipeline, we introduce OptiTrust, a modular LLM agent that performs multi-stage translation from natural language to solver-ready code, leveraging stepwise demonstrations, multi-language inference, and majority-vote cross-validation. Our agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks. Out of 7 datasets, it achieves the highest accuracy on six and outperforms the next-best algorithm by at least 8 percentage on three of them. Our approach provides a scalable, verifiable, and principled path toward building reliable LLM agents for real-world optimization applications.

Summary:
- The article discusses the importance of modeling evolving interactions among entities in various real-world tasks.
- It introduces a full-history graph for temporal-graph representation, separating intra-time-step and inter-time-step edges.
- The Edge-Type Decoupled Network (ETDNet) is designed to learn on this graph, with parallel modules for graph and temporal attention.
- ETDNet outperforms strong baselines in driver-intention prediction and Bitcoin fraud detection tasks.
- By representing structural and temporal relations as distinct edges in a single graph, ETDNet achieves significant improvements in predictive accuracy.  

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.03251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling evolving interactions among entities is critical in many real-world tasks. For example, predicting driver maneuvers in traffic requires tracking how neighboring vehicles accelerate, brake, and change lanes relative to one another over consecutive frames. Likewise, detecting financial fraud hinges on following the flow of funds through successive transactions as they propagate through the network. Unlike classic time-series forecasting, these settings demand reasoning over who interacts with whom and when, calling for a temporal-graph representation that makes both the relations and their evolution explicit. Existing temporal-graph methods typically use snapshot graphs to encode temporal evolution. We introduce a full-history graph that instantiates one node for every entity at every time step and separates two edge sets: (i) intra-time-step edges that capture relations within a single frame and (ii) inter-time-step edges that connect an entity to itself at consecutive steps. To learn on this graph we design an Edge-Type Decoupled Network (ETDNet) with parallel modules: a graph-attention module aggregates information along intra-time-step edges, a multi-head temporal-attention module attends over an entity's inter-time-step history, and a fusion module combines the two messages after every layer. Evaluated on driver-intention prediction (Waymo) and Bitcoin fraud detection (Elliptic++), ETDNet consistently surpasses strong baselines, lifting Waymo joint accuracy to 75.6\% (vs. 74.1\%) and raising Elliptic++ illicit-class F1 to 88.1\% (vs. 60.4\%). These gains demonstrate the benefit of representing structural and temporal relations as distinct edges in a single graph.

Abstract: Integrating external tools into Large Foundation Models (LFMs) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance their problem-solving capabilities. While existing studies have demonstrated strong performance in tool-augmented Visual Question Answering (VQA), recent benchmarks reveal significant gaps in real-world tool-use proficiency, particularly in functionally diverse multimodal settings requiring multi-step reasoning. In this work, we introduce ToolVQA, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising 23K instances, designed to bridge this gap. Unlike previous datasets that rely on synthetic scenarios and simplified queries, ToolVQA features real-world visual contexts and challenging implicit multi-step reasoning tasks, better aligning with real user interactions.

ToolVQA encompasses 10 multimodal tools across 7 diverse task domains, with an average inference length of 2.78 reasoning steps per instance. The fine-tuned 7B LFMs on ToolVQA not only achieve impressive performance on our test set but also surpass the large close-sourced model GPT-3.5-turbo on various out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets, demonstrating strong generalizability to real-world tool-use scenarios.

Summary: 
Nemori presents a new memory architecture, inspired by human cognitive principles, to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for long-term interactions. The Two-Step Alignment Principle organizes conversational streams into coherent episodes, addressing the issue of memory granularity. The Predict-Calibrate Principle allows the agent to learn from prediction gaps, enabling adaptive knowledge evolution beyond heuristics. This architecture outperforms existing systems in handling long-term workflows, particularly in longer contexts. Extensive experiments on benchmarks showcase Nemori's superiority over previous state-of-the-art methods. Overall, Nemori offers a promising solution to the limitations faced by autonomous agents in maintaining persistent memory in dynamic interactions. 

Summary:  <div>
arXiv:2508.03341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities, yet their inability to maintain persistent memory in long contexts limits their effectiveness as autonomous agents in long-term interactions. While existing memory systems have made progress, their reliance on arbitrary granularity for defining the basic memory unit and passive, rule-based mechanisms for knowledge extraction limits their capacity for genuine learning and evolution. To address these foundational limitations, we present Nemori, a novel self-organizing memory architecture inspired by human cognitive principles. Nemori's core innovation is twofold: First, its Two-Step Alignment Principle, inspired by Event Segmentation Theory, provides a principled, top-down method for autonomously organizing the raw conversational stream into semantically coherent episodes, solving the critical issue of memory granularity. Second, its Predict-Calibrate Principle, inspired by the Free-energy Principle, enables the agent to proactively learn from prediction gaps, moving beyond pre-defined heuristics to achieve adaptive knowledge evolution. This offers a viable path toward handling the long-term, dynamic workflows of autonomous agents. Extensive experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks demonstrate that Nemori significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art systems, with its advantage being particularly pronounced in longer contexts.

Abstract: The rise of LLMs such as ChatGPT and Claude fuels the need for AI agents capable of real-time task handling. However, migrating data-intensive, multi-modal edge workloads to cloud data centers, traditionally used for agent deployment, introduces significant latency. Deploying AI agents at the edge improves efficiency and reduces latency. However, edge environments present challenges due to limited and heterogeneous resources. Maintaining QoS for mobile users necessitates agent migration, which is complicated by the complexity of AI agents coordinating LLMs, task planning, memory, and external tools. This paper presents the first systematic deployment and management solution for LLM-based AI agents in dynamic edge environments. We propose a novel adaptive framework for AI agent placement and migration in edge intelligence systems. Our approach models resource constraints and latency/cost, leveraging ant colony algorithms and LLM-based optimization for efficient decision-making. It autonomously places agents to optimize resource utilization and QoS and enables lightweight agent migration by transferring only essential state. Implemented on a distributed system using AgentScope and validated across globally distributed edge servers, our solution significantly reduces deployment latency and migration costs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting excel at complex reasoning but generate verbose thought processes with considerable redundancy, leading to increased inference costs and reduced efficiency. We introduce a novel CoT compression framework based on step entropy, a metric that quantifies the informational contribution of individual reasoning steps to identify redundancy. Through theoretical analysis and extensive empirical validation on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we demonstrate that steps with low entropy are indeed highly redundant. Our experiments reveal that an astonishing 80\% of low-entropy intermediate steps can be pruned with minor degradation in the final answer accuracy across DeepSeek-R1-7B, 14B and Qwen3-8B. This finding sharply contrasts with random or high-entropy pruning, which severely impairs reasoning performance. Building on this, we propose a novel two-stage training strategy combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning. This approach enables LLMs to autonomously learn to generate compressed COTs during inference by strategically incorporating [SKIP] tokens. Our method significantly enhances LLM inference efficiency while rigorously preserving accuracy, offering profound implications for practical LLM deployment and a deeper understanding of reasoning structures.

Abstract: Automatic assessment of cognitive impairment from spontaneous speech offers a promising, non-invasive avenue for early cognitive screening. However, current approaches often lack generalizability when deployed across different languages and clinical settings, limiting their practical utility. In this study, we propose CogBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the cross-lingual and cross-site generalizability of large language models (LLMs) for speech-based cognitive impairment assessment. Using a unified multimodal pipeline, we evaluate model performance on three speech datasets spanning English and Mandarin: ADReSSo, NCMMSC2021-AD, and a newly collected test set, CIR-E. Our results show that conventional deep learning models degrade substantially when transferred across domains. In contrast, LLMs equipped with chain-of-thought prompting demonstrate better adaptability, though their performance remains sensitive to prompt design. Furthermore, we explore lightweight fine-tuning of LLMs via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which significantly improves generalization in target domains. These findings offer a critical step toward building clinically useful and linguistically robust speech-based cognitive assessment tools.

<div> Neurosymbolic AI, logical reasoning, integrative approach, hybrid approach, LNN, LLM-SS

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges faced by large language models in general logical reasoning and the emerging interest in neurosymbolic AI. It compares two main approaches, the integrative approach and the hybrid approach, in enhancing logical reasoning. The study introduces two models, LNN and LLM-SS, representing each approach, and analyzes their potential for developing general logical reasoning. The analysis shows that the hybrid approach is more promising, as it offers more interpretable reasoning chains and retains the advantages of existing LLMs. To support future research using the hybrid approach, a modular and model-agnostic framework based on LLM-SS is proposed, emphasizing its adaptability across domains with minimal human input. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: General logical reasoning, defined as the ability to reason deductively on domain-agnostic tasks, continues to be a challenge for large language models (LLMs). Current LLMs fail to reason deterministically and are not interpretable. As such, there has been a recent surge in interest in neurosymbolic AI, which attempts to incorporate logic into neural networks. We first identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical reasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic reasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach comprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network, performs symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising results on domain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance on domain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the following question: Which approach is more promising for developing general logical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class domain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses the integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the hybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each approach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising for developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is more interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of existing LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a generalizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design, model-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating code from natural language (NL) descriptions. However, the plain textual descriptions are inherently ambiguous and often fail to capture complex requirements like intricate system behaviors, conditional logic, and architectural constraints; implicit data dependencies in service-oriented architectures are difficult to infer and handle correctly. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel step-by-step code generation framework named UML2Dep by leveraging unambiguous formal specifications of complex requirements. First, we introduce an enhanced Unified Modeling Language (UML) sequence diagram tailored for service-oriented architectures. This diagram extends traditional visual syntax by integrating decision tables and API specifications, explicitly formalizing structural relationships and business logic flows in service interactions to rigorously eliminate linguistic ambiguity. Second, recognizing the critical role of data flow, we introduce a dedicated data dependency inference (DDI) task. DDI systematically constructs an explicit data dependency graph prior to actual code synthesis. To ensure reliability, we formalize DDI as a constrained mathematical reasoning task through novel prompting strategies, aligning with LLMs' excellent mathematical strengths. Additional static parsing and dependency pruning further reduce context complexity and cognitive load associated with intricate specifications, thereby enhancing reasoning accuracy and efficiency.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Error Generation, Error Diagnosis, Adversarial Framework, Mathematical Problem-Solving

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown proficiency in reasoning and generation tasks but struggle with error identification and diagnosis. To address this limitation, a dynamic adversarial framework called the Hide and Seek Game (HSG) is proposed for error generation and diagnosis, focusing on mathematical problem-solving. In HSG, two roles, namely Sneaky and Diagnosis, engage in an adversarial co-evolution to enhance error stealth and diagnostic precision. The framework significantly improves error diagnosis accuracy, outperforming baseline models like GPT-4o by 16.8% to 31.4%. Additionally, a dataset of deceptive errors and diagnostic annotations is released to serve as a benchmark for future research initiatives.<br /><br />Summary: The HSG framework introduces an innovative approach to enhancing error diagnosis in large language models, particularly in mathematical problem-solving tasks. By fostering dynamic adversarial interactions between error generation and diagnostic roles, HSG achieves notable improvements in error detection accuracy compared to traditional methods. The release of a deceptive error dataset further contributes to the advancement of research in error diagnosis within LLMs. <div>
arXiv:2508.03396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning and generation across domains, but still struggle with identifying and diagnosing complex errors. This stems mainly from training objectives that prioritize correct answers, limiting exposure to and learning from errors. While recent studies have begun to address this by introducing error signals, most rely on shallow, static errors, restricting improvement in deep diagnostic ability. To overcome this, we propose Hide and Seek Game (HSG), a dynamic adversarial framework for error generation and diagnosis, and evaluate it on mathematical problem-solving. HSG involves two adversarial roles: Sneaky, which "hides" by generating subtle, deceptive reasoning errors, and Diagnosis, which "seeks" to accurately detect them. Through adversarial co-evolution, both error stealth and diagnostic precision are enhanced. Experiments on several math reasoning tasks show that HSG significantly boosts error diagnosis, achieving 16.8\%--31.4\% higher accuracy than baselines like GPT-4o. We also release a challenging dataset of deceptive errors and diagnostic annotations as a benchmark for future research.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Model, Multi-Objective Optimization, Infeasibility Diagnosis, Routing Problems, Automatic Solver

Summary: 
Multi-Objective Infeasibility Diagnosis (MOID) introduces a novel approach to address infeasible routing problems by combining Large Language Model agents and multi-objective optimization. By considering both path cost and constraint violation, MOID generates a set of trade-off solutions that offer actionable suggestions for restoring model feasibility. Utilizing LLM agents, MOID analyzes these diverse solutions to diagnose the original infeasible model, providing users with valuable insights and suggestions for decision-making. The comparison with existing LLM-based methods on 50 types of infeasible routing problems demonstrates that MOID offers multiple diagnostic suggestions in a single run, offering practical solutions for restoring model feasibility and aiding decision-making.  <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.03406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In real-world routing problems, users often propose conflicting or unreasonable requirements, which result in infeasible optimization models due to overly restrictive or contradictory constraints, leading to an empty feasible solution set. Existing Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods attempt to diagnose infeasible models, but modifying such models often involves multiple potential adjustments that these methods do not consider. To fill this gap, we introduce Multi-Objective Infeasibility Diagnosis (MOID), which combines LLM agents and multi-objective optimization within an automatic routing solver, to provide a set of representative actionable suggestions. Specifically, MOID employs multi-objective optimization to consider both path cost and constraint violation, generating a set of trade-off solutions, each encompassing varying degrees of model adjustments. To extract practical insights from these solutions, MOID utilizes LLM agents to generate a solution analysis function for the infeasible model. This function analyzes these distinct solutions to diagnose the original infeasible model, providing users with diverse diagnostic insights and suggestions. Finally, we compare MOID with several LLM-based methods on 50 types of infeasible routing problems. The results indicate that MOID automatically generates multiple diagnostic suggestions in a single run, providing more practical insights for restoring model feasibility and decision-making compared to existing methods.

Summary:
- A new approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph generation is presented.
- The system uses large language model (LLM) agents to decompose PubMed abstracts into proposition sentences and extract knowledge graph triples.
- Triples are enhanced with open domain and ontology-based information extraction methods and a context variable to form quadruples.
- Validation shows high accuracy in extracting triples, with an average cosine similarity of 0.874 between generated and original sentences.
- LLMs are capable of inferring new relationships and connecting clusters in the knowledge graph.
- The proposed approach aims to provide medical practitioners with a centralized, real-time, and sustainable knowledge source. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.03438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of publicly-available medical data presents a challenge for clinicians and researchers alike, increasing the gap between the volume of scientific literature and its applications. The steady growth of studies and findings overwhelms medical professionals at large, hindering their ability to systematically review and understand the latest knowledge. This paper presents an approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG) generation to identify and connect biomedical knowledge. Through a pipeline of large language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts into semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from these sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain and ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate ontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during extraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming `quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing natural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original propositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874. The similarity for generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated sentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context variable. Furthermore, this research explores the ability for LLMs to infer new relationships and connect clusters in the knowledge base of the knowledge graph. This approach leads the way to provide medical practitioners with a centralised, updated in real-time, and sustainable knowledge source, and may be the foundation of similar gains in a wide variety of fields.

<div> Graph theory, Belief systems, Epistemic relationships, Credibility, Confidence  
Summary:  
- Belief systems are often represented as consistent sets of propositions or probability distributions, but this overlooks their internal structure and contradictions.   
- A new formalism is introduced using directed, weighted graphs where nodes represent beliefs and edges represent relationships like support or contradiction.   
- Credibility and confidence functions are assigned to beliefs, reflecting trust in sources and internal support respectively.   
- Unlike traditional models, this approach does not require coherence or belief updating and allows for fine-grained structural representation.  
- The model is static, focusing on belief organization rather than inference or revision.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.03465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Belief systems are often treated as globally consistent sets of propositions or as scalar-valued probability distributions. Such representations tend to obscure the internal structure of belief, conflate external credibility with internal coherence, and preclude the modeling of fragmented or contradictory epistemic states. This paper introduces a minimal formalism for belief systems as directed, weighted graphs. In this framework, nodes represent individual beliefs, edges encode epistemic relationships (e.g., support or contradiction), and two distinct functions assign each belief a credibility (reflecting source trust) and a confidence (derived from internal structural support). Unlike classical probabilistic models, our approach does not assume prior coherence or require belief updating. Unlike logical and argumentation-based frameworks, it supports fine-grained structural representation without committing to binary justification status or deductive closure. The model is purely static and deliberately excludes inference or revision procedures. Its aim is to provide a foundational substrate for analyzing the internal organization of belief systems, including coherence conditions, epistemic tensions, and representational limits. By distinguishing belief structure from belief strength, this formalism enables a richer classification of epistemic states than existing probabilistic, logical, or argumentation-based approaches.

<div> Keywords: smart home, behavior data, anomaly detection, behavior prediction, continual adaptation

Summary: 
SmartGen is a framework for synthesizing user behavior data in smart homes to support continual adaptation of intelligent models. It addresses the issue of behavioral drift caused by changes in routines or lifestyle. The framework consists of four main components: Time and Semantic-aware Split module, Semantic-aware Sequence Compression, Graph-guided Sequence Synthesis, and Two-stage Outlier Filter. These components work together to divide behavior sequences, compress input data, guide data generation aligned with contextual changes, and filter out implausible outputs. Experiments on real-world datasets show that SmartGen significantly improves performance on anomaly detection and behavior prediction tasks under behavioral drift. Anomaly detection performance improved by 85.43% on average, and behavior prediction improved by 70.51%. The code for SmartGen is available on GitHub for further exploration. 

Summary:  <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.03484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As smart homes become increasingly prevalent, intelligent models are widely used for tasks such as anomaly detection and behavior prediction. These models are typically trained on static datasets, making them brittle to behavioral drift caused by seasonal changes, lifestyle shifts, or evolving routines. However, collecting new behavior data for retraining is often impractical due to its slow pace, high cost, and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose SmartGen, an LLM-based framework that synthesizes context-aware user behavior data to support continual adaptation of downstream smart home models. SmartGen consists of four key components. First, we design a Time and Semantic-aware Split module to divide long behavior sequences into manageable, semantically coherent subsequences under dual time-span constraints. Second, we propose Semantic-aware Sequence Compression to reduce input length while preserving representative semantics by clustering behavior mapping in latent space. Third, we introduce Graph-guided Sequence Synthesis, which constructs a behavior relationship graph and encodes frequent transitions into prompts, guiding the LLM to generate data aligned with contextual changes while retaining core behavior patterns. Finally, we design a Two-stage Outlier Filter to identify and remove implausible or semantically inconsistent outputs, aiming to improve the factual coherence and behavioral validity of the generated sequences. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that SmartGen significantly enhances model performance on anomaly detection and behavior prediction tasks under behavioral drift, with anomaly detection improving by 85.43% and behavior prediction by 70.51% on average. The code is available at https://github.com/horizonsinzqs/SmartGen.

Summary: 
Large language models have shown the ability to perform multi-step reasoning but often make errors that propagate. They struggle with hallucinations and formatting issues, particularly in tasks like generating mathematical expressions. To address this, the EDCIM method is introduced for interpretable mathematics tasks, where the model must provide the exact functional form to solve a problem explicitly. EDCIM uses LLMs to generate equations and a symbolic error-detection framework to identify and correct errors. By integrating lightweight open-source LLMs with more powerful models, EDCIM balances cost and accuracy with a single hyperparameter. Experimental results demonstrate that EDCIM significantly reduces computational and financial costs while maintaining or improving prediction accuracy when properly configured. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to perform explicit multi-step reasoning such as chain-of-thought prompting. However, their intermediate steps often contain errors that can propagate leading to inaccurate final predictions. Additionally, LLMs still struggle with hallucinations and often fail to adhere to prescribed output formats, which is particularly problematic for tasks like generating mathematical expressions or source code. This work introduces EDCIM (Error Detection and Correction for Interpretable Mathematics), a method for detecting and correcting these errors in interpretable mathematics tasks, where the model must generate the exact functional form that explicitly solve the problem (expressed in natural language) rather than a black-box solution. EDCIM uses LLMs to generate a system of equations for a given problem, followed by a symbolic error-detection framework that identifies errors and provides targeted feedback for LLM-based correction. To optimize efficiency, EDCIM integrates lightweight, open-source LLMs with more powerful proprietary models, balancing cost and accuracy. This balance is controlled by a single hyperparameter, allowing users to control the trade-off based on their cost and accuracy requirements. Experimental results across different datasets show that EDCIM significantly reduces both computational and financial costs, while maintaining, and even improving, prediction accuracy when the balance is properly configured.

<div> Keywords: Massive activations, Transformer training, Pythia model, Mathematical modeling, Machine learning framework

Summary:
The study explores the emergence and dynamics of massive activations in transformer models during training. Through analyzing the Pythia model family at various training checkpoints, the researchers found that massive activation development follows predictable mathematical patterns. They developed a machine learning framework to predict the key parameters governing massive activation emergence from architectural specifications. The framework achieved high accuracy in predicting steady-state behavior and moderate accuracy in emergence timing and magnitude. The findings suggest that architects can potentially control massive activation emergence through design choices before training. This has significant implications for model stability, training cycle length, interpretability, and optimization. The study demonstrates that massive activations are influenced by model design and can be anticipated and managed proactively. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.03616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive activations are scalar values in transformer hidden states that achieve values orders of magnitude larger than typical activations and have been shown to be critical for model functionality. While prior work has characterized these phenomena in fully trained models, the temporal dynamics of their emergence during training remain poorly understood. We present the first comprehensive analysis of massive activation development throughout transformer training, using the Pythia model family as our testbed. Through systematic analysis of various model sizes across multiple training checkpoints, we demonstrate that massive activation emergence follows predictable mathematical patterns that can be accurately modeled using an exponentially-modulated logarithmic function with five key parameters. We develop a machine learning framework to predict these mathematical parameters from architectural specifications alone, achieving high accuracy for steady-state behavior and moderate accuracy for emergence timing and magnitude. These findings enable architects to predict and potentially control key aspects of massive activation emergence through design choices, with significant implications for model stability, training cycle length, interpretability, and optimization. Our findings demonstrate that the emergence of massive activations is governed by model design and can be anticipated, and potentially controlled, before training begins.

<div> Keywords: code generation, faulty premises, large language models, evaluation framework, reasoning abilities

Summary: 
Most large language models (LLMs) struggle with code generation when presented with faulty premises, relying heavily on explicit prompts for error detection and lacking self-scrutiny capabilities. Increasing resource investment does not necessarily improve code generation quality, as there is a point of diminishing returns. Different types of faulty premises activate distinct defect patterns in LLMs, revealing a triple dissociation in their cognitive mechanisms of code generation. The study emphasizes the importance of LLMs proactively verifying premises in code generation and introduces the Faulty Premises Bench (FPBench) framework for evaluating code generation performance under faulty premises. The multi-dimensional evaluation system provided in the study offers a theoretical foundation and practical pathway for developing more reliable and human-centric code generation models.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.03622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advancement of code generation capabilities in large language models (LLMs), their reliance on input premises has intensified. When users provide inputs containing faulty premises, the probability of code generation hallucinations rises significantly, exposing deficiencies in their self-scrutiny capabilities. This paper proposes Faulty Premises Bench (FPBench), the first code generation evaluation framework targeting faulty premises. By systematically constructing three categories of faulty premises and integrating multi-dimensional evaluation metrics, it conducts in-depth assessments of 15 representative LLMs. The key findings are as follows: (1) Most models exhibit poor reasoning abilities and suboptimal code generation performance under faulty premises, heavily relying on explicit prompts for error detection, with limited self-scrutiny capabilities; (2) Faulty premises trigger a point of diminishing returns in resource investment, leading to blindly increasing length fails to enhance quality; (3) The three types of faulty premises respectively activate distinct defect patterns in models, revealing a triple dissociation in the cognitive mechanisms of code generation models. This study not only highlights the urgent need for LLMs to proactively verify premises in code generation but also, through the proposed FPBench framework and multi-dimensional evaluation system, provides a theoretical foundation and practical pathway for developing reliable, human-centric code generation models.

Abstract: Computational scientific discovery increasingly relies on algorithms to process complex data and identify meaningful patterns - yet faces persistent challenges in gravitational-wave signal identification. While existing algorithmic approaches like matched filtering (MF) and deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved partial success, their limitations directly stem from fundamental limitations: MF's excessive computational demands arise from its reliance on predefined theoretical waveform templates, while DNNs' black-box architectures obscure decision logic and introduce hidden biases. We propose Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search (Evo-MCTS), a framework that addresses these limitations through systematic algorithm space exploration guided by domain-aware physical constraints. Our approach combines tree-structured search with evolutionary optimization and large language model heuristics to create interpretable algorithmic solutions. Our Evo-MCTS framework demonstrates substantial improvements, achieving a 20.2\% improvement over state-of-the-art gravitational wave detection algorithms on the MLGWSC-1 benchmark dataset. High-performing algorithm variants consistently exceed thresholds. The framework generates human-interpretable algorithmic pathways that reveal distinct performance patterns. Beyond performance improvements, our framework discovers novel algorithmic combinations, thereby establishing a transferable methodology for automated algorithmic discovery across computational science domains.

Abstract: We present Agent Lightning, a flexible and extensible framework that enables Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training of Large Language Models (LLMs) for any AI agent. Unlike existing methods that tightly couple RL training with agent or rely on sequence concatenation with masking, Agent Lightning achieves complete decoupling between agent execution and training, allowing seamless integration with existing agents developed via diverse ways (e.g., using frameworks like LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, AutoGen, and building from scratch) with almost ZERO code modifications. By formulating agent execution as Markov decision process, we define an unified data interface and propose a hierarchical RL algorithm, LightningRL, which contains a credit assignment module, allowing us to decompose trajectories generated by ANY agents into training transition. This enables RL to handle complex interaction logic, such as multi-agent scenarios and dynamic workflows. For the system design, we introduce a Training-Agent Disaggregation architecture, and brings agent observability frameworks into agent runtime, providing a standardized agent finetuning interface. Experiments across text-to-SQL, retrieval-augmented generation, and math tool-use tasks demonstrate stable, continuous improvements, showcasing the framework's potential for real-world agent training and deployment.

Abstract: Video generation has made significant strides with the development of diffusion models; however, achieving high temporal consistency remains a challenging task. Recently, FreeInit identified a training-inference gap and introduced a method to iteratively refine the initial noise during inference. However, iterative refinement significantly increases the computational cost associated with video generation. In this paper, we introduce FastInit, a fast noise initialization method that eliminates the need for iterative refinement. FastInit learns a Video Noise Prediction Network (VNPNet) that takes random noise and a text prompt as input, generating refined noise in a single forward pass. Therefore, FastInit greatly enhances the efficiency of video generation while achieving high temporal consistency across frames. To train the VNPNet, we create a large-scale dataset consisting of pairs of text prompts, random noise, and refined noise. Extensive experiments with various text-to-video models show that our method consistently improves the quality and temporal consistency of the generated videos. FastInit not only provides a substantial improvement in video generation but also offers a practical solution that can be applied directly during inference. The code and dataset will be released.

Abstract: The growing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into education has intensified the need for transparency and interpretability. While hackathons have long served as agile environments for rapid AI prototyping, few have directly addressed eXplainable AI (XAI) in real-world educational contexts. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the XAI Challenge 2025, a hackathon-style competition jointly organized by Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT) and the International Workshop on Trustworthiness and Reliability in Neurosymbolic AI (TRNS-AI), held as part of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2025). The challenge tasked participants with building Question-Answering (QA) systems capable of answering student queries about university policies while generating clear, logic-based natural language explanations. To promote transparency and trustworthiness, solutions were required to use lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) or hybrid LLM-symbolic systems. A high-quality dataset was provided, constructed via logic-based templates with Z3 validation and refined through expert student review to ensure alignment with real-world academic scenarios. We describe the challenge's motivation, structure, dataset construction, and evaluation protocol. Situating the competition within the broader evolution of AI hackathons, we argue that it represents a novel effort to bridge LLMs and symbolic reasoning in service of explainability. Our findings offer actionable insights for future XAI-centered educational systems and competitive research initiatives.

Abstract: Emotional and mental well-being are vital components of quality of life, and with the rise of smart devices like smartphones, wearables, and artificial intelligence (AI), new opportunities for monitoring emotions in everyday settings have emerged. However, for AI algorithms to be effective, they require high-quality data and accurate annotations. As the focus shifts towards collecting emotion data in real-world environments to capture more authentic emotional experiences, the process of gathering emotion annotations has become increasingly complex. This work explores the challenges of everyday emotion data collection from the perspectives of key stakeholders. We collected 75 survey responses, performed 32 interviews with the public, and 3 focus group discussions (FGDs) with 12 mental health professionals. The insights gained from a total of 119 stakeholders informed the development of our framework, AnnoSense, designed to support everyday emotion data collection for AI. This framework was then evaluated by 25 emotion AI experts for its clarity, usefulness, and adaptability. Lastly, we discuss the potential next steps and implications of AnnoSense for future research in emotion AI, highlighting its potential to enhance the collection and analysis of emotion data in real-world contexts.

<title>A Bayesian Hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Method for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in reshaping the world. As these models are pretrained on general corpora, they often require domain-specific fine-tuning to optimize performance in specialized business applications. Due to their massive scale, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are widely used to reduce training costs. Among them, hybrid PEFT methods that combine multiple PEFT techniques have achieved the best performance. However, existing hybrid PEFT methods face two main challenges when fine-tuning LLMs for specialized applications: (1) relying on point estimates, lacking the ability to quantify uncertainty for reliable decision-making, and (2) struggling to dynamically adapt to emerging data, lacking the ability to suit real-world situations. We propose Bayesian Hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (BH-PEFT), a novel method that integrates Bayesian learning into hybrid PEFT. BH-PEFT combines Adapter, LoRA, and prefix-tuning to fine-tune feedforward and attention layers of the Transformer. By modeling learnable parameters as distributions, BH-PEFT enables uncertainty quantification. We further propose a Bayesian dynamic fine-tuning approach where the last posterior serves as the prior for the next round, enabling effective adaptation to new data. We evaluated BH-PEFT on business tasks such as sentiment analysis, news categorization, and commonsense reasoning. Results show that our method outperforms existing PEFT baselines, enables uncertainty quantification for more reliable decisions, and improves adaptability in dynamic scenarios. This work contributes to business analytics and data science by proposing a novel BH-PEFT method and dynamic fine-tuning approach that support uncertainty-aware and adaptive decision-making in real-world situations.

Abstract: Apnea is a common sleep disorder characterized by breathing interruptions lasting at least ten seconds and occurring more than five times per hour. Accurate, high-temporal-resolution detection of sleep apnea subtypes - Obstructive, Central, and Mixed - is crucial for effective treatment and management. This paper presents an energy-efficient method for classifying these subtypes using a single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) with high temporal resolution to address the real-time needs of wearable devices. We evaluate a wide range of classical machine learning algorithms and deep learning architectures on 1-second ECG windows, comparing their accuracy, complexity, and energy consumption. Based on this analysis, we introduce SleepLiteCNN, a compact and energy-efficient convolutional neural network specifically designed for wearable platforms. SleepLiteCNN achieves over 95% accuracy and a 92% macro-F1 score, while requiring just 1.8 microjoules per inference after 8-bit quantization. Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) synthesis further demonstrates significant reductions in hardware resource usage, confirming its suitability for continuous, real-time monitoring in energy-constrained environments. These results establish SleepLiteCNN as a practical and effective solution for wearable device sleep apnea subtype detection.

Abstract: This work introduces ZetA, a novel deep learning optimizer that extends Adam by incorporating dynamic scaling based on the Riemann zeta function. To the best of our knowledge, ZetA is the first optimizer to apply zeta-based gradient scaling within deep learning optimization. The method improves generalization and robustness through a hybrid update mechanism that integrates adaptive damping, cosine similarity-based momentum boosting, entropy-regularized loss, and Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM)-style perturbations. Empirical evaluations on SVHN, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, STL10, and noisy CIFAR10 consistently show test accuracy improvements over Adam. All experiments employ a lightweight fully connected network trained for five epochs under mixed-precision settings. The results demonstrate that ZetA is a computationally efficient and robust alternative to Adam, particularly effective in noisy or high-granularity classification tasks.

Abstract: Personalized electrocardiogram (ECG) generation is to simulate a patient's ECG digital twins tailored to specific conditions. It has the potential to transform traditional healthcare into a more accurate individualized paradigm, while preserving the key benefits of conventional population-level ECG synthesis. However, this promising task presents two fundamental challenges: extracting individual features without ground truth and injecting various types of conditions without confusing generative model. In this paper, we present ECGTwin, a two-stage framework designed to address these challenges. In the first stage, an Individual Base Extractor trained via contrastive learning robustly captures personal features from a reference ECG. In the second stage, the extracted individual features, along with a target cardiac condition, are integrated into the diffusion-based generation process through our novel AdaX Condition Injector, which injects these signals via two dedicated and specialized pathways. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments have demonstrated that our model can not only generate ECG signals of high fidelity and diversity by offering a fine-grained generation controllability, but also preserving individual-specific features. Furthermore, ECGTwin shows the potential to enhance ECG auto-diagnosis in downstream application, confirming the possibility of precise personalized healthcare solutions.

<title>Blueprint First, Model Second: A Framework for Deterministic LLM Workflow</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While powerful, the inherent non-determinism of large language model (LLM) agents limits their application in structured operational environments where procedural fidelity and predictable execution are strict requirements. This limitation stems from current architectures that conflate probabilistic, high-level planning with low-level action execution within a single generative process. To address this, we introduce the Source Code Agent framework, a new paradigm built on the "Blueprint First, Model Second" philosophy. Our framework decouples the workflow logic from the generative model. An expert-defined operational procedure is first codified into a source code-based Execution Blueprint, which is then executed by a deterministic engine. The LLM is strategically invoked as a specialized tool to handle bounded, complex sub-tasks within the workflow, but never to decide the workflow's path. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the challenging tau-bench benchmark, designed for complex user-tool-rule scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the Source Code Agent establishes a new state-of-the-art, outperforming the strongest baseline by 10.1 percentage points on the average Pass^1 score while dramatically improving execution efficiency. Our work enables the verifiable and reliable deployment of autonomous agents in applications governed by strict procedural logic.

<title>Veli: Unsupervised Method and Unified Benchmark for Low-Cost Air Quality Sensor Correction</title>

Abstract: Urban air pollution is a major health crisis causing millions of premature deaths annually, underscoring the urgent need for accurate and scalable monitoring of air quality (AQ). While low-cost sensors (LCS) offer a scalable alternative to expensive reference-grade stations, their readings are affected by drift, calibration errors, and environmental interference. To address these challenges, we introduce Veli (Reference-free Variational Estimation via Latent Inference), an unsupervised Bayesian model that leverages variational inference to correct LCS readings without requiring co-location with reference stations, eliminating a major deployment barrier. Specifically, Veli constructs a disentangled representation of the LCS readings, effectively separating the true pollutant reading from the sensor noise. To build our model and address the lack of standardized benchmarks in AQ monitoring, we also introduce the Air Quality Sensor Data Repository (AQ-SDR). AQ-SDR is the largest AQ sensor benchmark to date, with readings from 23,737 LCS and reference stations across multiple regions. Veli demonstrates strong generalization across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, effectively handling sensor drift and erratic sensor behavior. Code for model and dataset will be made public when this paper is published.

Abstract: In this research, I explore advanced deep learning methodologies to forecast the outcomes of the 2025 NCAA Division 1 Men's and Women's Basketball tournaments. Leveraging historical NCAA game data, I implement two sophisticated sequence-based models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer architectures. The predictive power of these models is augmented through comprehensive feature engineering, including team quality metrics derived from Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Elo ratings, seed differences, and aggregated box-score statistics. To evaluate the robustness and reliability of predictions, I train each model variant using both Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) and Brier loss functions, providing insights into classification performance and probability calibration. My comparative analysis reveals that while the Transformer architecture optimized with BCE yields superior discriminative power (highest AUC of 0.8473), the LSTM model trained with Brier loss demonstrates superior probabilistic calibration (lowest Brier score of 0.1589). These findings underscore the importance of selecting appropriate model architectures and loss functions based on the specific requirements of forecasting tasks. The detailed analytical pipeline presented here serves as a reproducible framework for future predictive modeling tasks in sports analytics and beyond.

Abstract: Profiling tools (also known as profilers) play an important role in understanding program performance at runtime, such as hotspots, bottlenecks, and inefficiencies. While profilers have been proven to be useful, they give extra burden to software engineers. Software engineers, as the users, are responsible to interpret the complex performance data and identify actionable optimization in program source code. However, it can be challenging for users to associate inefficiencies with the program semantics, especially if the users are not the authors of the code, which limits the applicability of profilers.
  In this thesis, we explore a new direction to combine performance profiles and program semantics with a deep learning approach. The key idea is to glean code summary for semantic information (at a certain level) and integrate it into a profiler, which can better understand program inefficiencies for actionable optimization. To be concrete, we combine profiles generated by Async Profiler (the state-of-the-art Java profiler) with code summarization from a fine-tuned CodeBERT-based model. We demonstrate the code summaries of any selected call path in a graphic user interface. Our system can effectively assist analysis on many Java benchmarks.

Abstract: Evaluating teaching effectiveness at scale remains a persistent challenge for large universities, particularly within engineering programs that enroll tens of thousands of students. Traditional methods, such as manual review of student evaluations, are often impractical, leading to overlooked insights and inconsistent data use. This article presents a scalable, AI-supported framework for synthesizing qualitative student feedback using large language models. The system employs hierarchical summarization, anonymization, and exception handling to extract actionable themes from open-ended comments while upholding ethical safeguards. Visual analytics contextualize numeric scores through percentile-based comparisons, historical trends, and instructional load. The approach supports meaningful evaluation and aligns with best practices in qualitative analysis and educational assessment, incorporating student, peer, and self-reflective inputs without automating personnel decisions. We report on its successful deployment across a large college of engineering. Preliminary validation through comparisons with human reviewers, faculty feedback, and longitudinal analysis suggests that LLM-generated summaries can reliably support formative evaluation and professional development. This work demonstrates how AI systems, when designed with transparency and shared governance, can promote teaching excellence and continuous improvement at scale within academic institutions.

Abstract: Maintaining code quality in large-scale software systems presents significant challenges, particularly in settings where a large numbers of engineers work concurrently on a codebase. This paper introduces Code Quality Score (CQS) system to automatically detect issues with a set of code changes and provide actionable insights. At its core, the CQS system is powered by two Llama3 models, fine-tuned (with SFT and offline RL approaches), to a) detect common code quality issues related to coding best practices and b) to provide good ``critiques'' for LLM-generated code review respectively. To maintain good user experience, we layer the system with hand-crafted rules to filter out incorrect responses/hallucinations. Offline evaluations show that our CQS system is able to achieve an impressive precision rate for identifying valid issues. This system has already been rolled out to developers in an industrial scale setting and has consistently achieved 60\% week over week user helpfulness rate, demonstrating its effectiveness in a real-world environment. In this paper, we present details of the CQS system along with some learnings on curating developer feedback to create training data for LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: The success of large-scale pre-training paradigm, exemplified by Large Language Models (LLMs), has inspired the development of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs). However, their application to financial candlestick (K-line) data remains limited, often underperforming non-pre-trained architectures. Moreover, existing TSFMs often overlook crucial downstream tasks such as volatility prediction and synthetic data generation. To address these limitations, we propose Kronos, a unified, scalable pre-training framework tailored to financial K-line modeling. Kronos introduces a specialized tokenizer that discretizes continuous market information into token sequences, preserving both price dynamics and trade activity patterns. We pre-train Kronos using an autoregressive objective on a massive, multi-market corpus of over 12 billion K-line records from 45 global exchanges, enabling it to learn nuanced temporal and cross-asset representations. Kronos excels in a zero-shot setting across a diverse set of financial tasks. On benchmark datasets, Kronos boosts price series forecasting RankIC by 93% over the leading TSFM and 87% over the best non-pre-trained baseline. It also achieves a 9% lower MAE in volatility forecasting and a 22% improvement in generative fidelity for synthetic K-line sequences. These results establish Kronos as a robust, versatile foundation model for end-to-end financial time series analysis. Our pre-trained model is publicly available at https://github.com/shiyu-coder/Kronos.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted as research assistants, particularly for literature review and reference recommendation, yet little is known about whether they introduce demographic bias into citation workflows. This study systematically investigates gender bias in LLM-driven reference selection using controlled experiments with pseudonymous author names. We evaluate several LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude Sonnet, and Claude Haiku) by varying gender composition within candidate reference pools and analyzing selection patterns across fields. Our results reveal two forms of bias: a persistent preference for male-authored references and a majority-group bias that favors whichever gender is more prevalent in the candidate pool. These biases are amplified in larger candidate pools and only modestly attenuated by prompt-based mitigation strategies. Field-level analysis indicates that bias magnitude varies across scientific domains, with social sciences showing the least bias. Our findings indicate that LLMs can reinforce or exacerbate existing gender imbalances in scholarly recognition. Effective mitigation strategies are needed to avoid perpetuating existing gender disparities in scientific citation practices before integrating LLMs into high-stakes academic workflows.

Abstract: Large-scale tuberculosis (TB) screening is limited by the high cost and operational complexity of traditional diagnostics, creating a need for artificial-intelligence solutions. We propose DeepGB-TB, a non-invasive system that instantly assigns TB risk scores using only cough audio and basic demographic data. The model couples a lightweight one-dimensional convolutional neural network for audio processing with a gradient-boosted decision tree for tabular features. Its principal innovation is a Cross-Modal Bidirectional Cross-Attention module (CM-BCA) that iteratively exchanges salient cues between modalities, emulating the way clinicians integrate symptoms and risk factors. To meet the clinical priority of minimizing missed cases, we design a Tuberculosis Risk-Balanced Loss (TRBL) that places stronger penalties on false-negative predictions, thereby reducing high-risk misclassifications. DeepGB-TB is evaluated on a diverse dataset of 1,105 patients collected across seven countries, achieving an AUROC of 0.903 and an F1-score of 0.851, representing a new state of the art. Its computational efficiency enables real-time, offline inference directly on common mobile devices, making it ideal for low-resource settings. Importantly, the system produces clinically validated explanations that promote trust and adoption by frontline health workers. By coupling AI innovation with public-health requirements for speed, affordability, and reliability, DeepGB-TB offers a tool for advancing global TB control.

To overcome these challenges, we propose a spectrum foundation model, termed SpectrumFM, which provides a new paradigm for spectrum cognition. An innovative spectrum encoder that exploits the convolutional neural networks and the multi-head self attention mechanisms is proposed to effectively capture both fine-grained local signal structures and high-level global dependencies in the spectrum data. To enhance its adaptability, two novel self-supervised learning tasks, namely masked reconstruction and next-slot signal prediction, are developed for pre-training SpectrumFM, enabling the model to learn rich and transferable representations. Furthermore, low-rank adaptation (LoRA) parameter-efficient fine-tuning is exploited to enable SpectrumFM to seamlessly adapt to various downstream spectrum cognition tasks, including spectrum sensing (SS), anomaly detection (AD), and wireless technology classification (WTC). Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SpectrumFM over state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it improves detection probability in the SS task by 30% at -4 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), boosts the area under the curve (AUC) in the AD task by over 10%, and enhances WTC accuracy by 9.6%.

Abstract: Pan-cancer classification using transcriptomic (RNA-Seq) data can inform tumor subtyping and therapy selection, but is challenging due to extremely high dimensionality and limited sample sizes. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning framework that uses a class-conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE) to augment training data for pan-cancer gene expression classification. Using 801 tumor RNA-Seq samples spanning 5 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we first perform feature selection to reduce 20,531 gene expression features to the 500 most variably expressed genes. A cVAE is then trained on this data to learn a latent representation of gene expression conditioned on cancer type, enabling the generation of synthetic gene expression samples for each tumor class. We augment the training set with these cVAE-generated samples (doubling the dataset size) to mitigate overfitting and class imbalance. A two-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier is subsequently trained on the augmented dataset to predict tumor type. The augmented framework achieves high classification accuracy (~98%) on a held-out test set, substantially outperforming a classifier trained on the original data alone. We present detailed experimental results, including VAE training curves, classifier performance metrics (ROC curves and confusion matrix), and architecture diagrams to illustrate the approach. The results demonstrate that cVAE-based synthetic augmentation can significantly improve pan-cancer prediction performance, especially for underrepresented cancer classes.

Abstract: This review presents a comprehensive survey and benchmark of pulse shape discrimination (PSD) algorithms for radiation detection, classifying nearly sixty methods into statistical (time-domain, frequency-domain, neural network-based) and prior-knowledge (machine learning, deep learning) paradigms. We implement and evaluate all algorithms on two standardized datasets: an unlabeled set from a 241Am-9Be source and a time-of-flight labeled set from a 238Pu-9Be source, using metrics including Figure of Merit (FOM), F1-score, ROC-AUC, and inter-method correlations. Our analysis reveals that deep learning models, particularly Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and hybrid approaches combining statistical features with neural regression, often outperform traditional methods. We discuss architectural suitabilities, the limitations of FOM, alternative evaluation metrics, and performance across energy thresholds. Accompanying this work, we release an open-source toolbox in Python and MATLAB, along with the datasets, to promote reproducibility and advance PSD research.

<title>SmallKV: Small Model Assisted Compensation of KV Cache Compression for Efficient LLM Inference</title>

Abstract: KV cache eviction has emerged as an effective solution to alleviate resource constraints faced by LLMs in long-context scenarios. However, existing token-level eviction methods often overlook two critical aspects: (1) their irreversible eviction strategy fails to adapt to dynamic attention patterns during decoding (the saliency shift problem), and (2) they treat both marginally important tokens and truly unimportant tokens equally, despite the collective significance of marginal tokens to model performance (the marginal information over-compression problem). To address these issues, we design two compensation mechanisms based on the high similarity of attention matrices between LLMs of different scales. We propose SmallKV, a small model assisted compensation method for KV cache compression. SmallKV can maintain attention matching between different-scale LLMs to: 1) assist the larger model in perceiving globally important information of attention; and 2) use the smaller model's attention scores to approximate those of marginal tokens in the larger model. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including GSM8K, BBH, MT-Bench, and LongBench demonstrate the effectiveness of SmallKV. Moreover, efficiency evaluations show that SmallKV achieves 1.75 - 2.56 times higher throughput than baseline methods, highlighting its potential for efficient and performant LLM inference in resource constrained environments.

Abstract: Time Series Forecasting (TSF) faces persistent challenges in modeling intricate temporal dependencies across different scales. Despite recent advances leveraging different decomposition operations and novel architectures based on CNN, MLP or Transformer, existing methods still struggle with static decomposition strategies, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion mechanisms, limiting their ability to model intricate temporal dependencies. To explicitly solve the mentioned three problems respectively, we propose a novel Dynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework (DMSC) with Multi-Scale Patch Decomposition block (EMPD), Triad Interaction Block (TIB) and Adaptive Scale Routing MoE block (ASR-MoE). Specifically, EMPD is designed as a built-in component to dynamically segment sequences into hierarchical patches with exponentially scaled granularities, eliminating predefined scale constraints through input-adaptive patch adjustment. TIB then jointly models intra-patch, inter-patch, and cross-variable dependencies within each layer's decomposed representations. EMPD and TIB are jointly integrated into layers forming a multi-layer progressive cascade architecture, where coarse-grained representations from earlier layers adaptively guide fine-grained feature extraction in subsequent layers via gated pathways. And ASR-MoE dynamically fuses multi-scale predictions by leveraging specialized global and local experts with temporal-aware weighting. Comprehensive experiments on thirteen real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DMSC consistently maintains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and superior computational efficiency for TSF tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/1327679995/DMSC.

Abstract: We propose a formal reconstruction of quantum mechanics grounded not in external mathematical abstractions, but in the structured dynamics of subjective experience. The Qualia Abstraction Language (QAL) models physical systems as evolving streams of introspective units, structured sequences of modality, shape, and functional effect, rather than as state vectors in Hilbert space. This approach reimagines core quantum concepts: superposition becomes a form of structured ambiguity; collapse is reframed as an introspective contraction; and entanglement is modeled as semantic resonance across streams of qualia. Drawing on insights from nominalist philosophy and oversight theoretic limits in AI, we argue that the observer paradox in quantum mechanics reflects not an ontological lacuna, but a linguistic one: the absence of a formal vocabulary for modeling first person structure. QAL introduces such a vocabulary, providing a morphodynamic framework that embeds the observer within the system and replaces abstract projection with endogenous transformation. We analyze the alignment of QAL with endophysical approaches, contrast it with standard interpretations of quantum theory, and explore its implications for a post Platonist, introspectively grounded physics.

Abstract: Synthetic time series are essential tools for data augmentation, stress testing, and algorithmic prototyping in quantitative finance. However, in cryptocurrency markets, characterized by 24/7 trading, extreme volatility, and rapid regime shifts, existing Time Series Generation (TSG) methods and benchmarks often fall short, jeopardizing practical utility. Most prior work (1) targets non-financial or traditional financial domains, (2) focuses narrowly on classification and forecasting while neglecting crypto-specific complexities, and (3) lacks critical financial evaluations, particularly for trading applications. To address these gaps, we introduce \textsf{CTBench}, the first comprehensive TSG benchmark tailored for the cryptocurrency domain. \textsf{CTBench} curates an open-source dataset from 452 tokens and evaluates TSG models across 13 metrics spanning 5 key dimensions: forecasting accuracy, rank fidelity, trading performance, risk assessment, and computational efficiency. A key innovation is a dual-task evaluation framework: (1) the \emph{Predictive Utility} task measures how well synthetic data preserves temporal and cross-sectional patterns for forecasting, while (2) the \emph{Statistical Arbitrage} task assesses whether reconstructed series support mean-reverting signals for trading. We benchmark eight representative models from five methodological families over four distinct market regimes, uncovering trade-offs between statistical fidelity and real-world profitability. Notably, \textsf{CTBench} offers model ranking analysis and actionable guidance for selecting and deploying TSG models in crypto analytics and strategy development.

Abstract: The accelerated evolution of digital infrastructures and algorithmic systems is reshaping how the humanities engage with knowledge and culture. Rooted in the traditions of Digital Humanities and Digital Humanism, the concept of "Cyber Humanities" proposes a critical reconfiguration of humanistic inquiry for the post-digital era. This Manifesto introduces a flexible framework that integrates ethical design, sustainable digital practices, and participatory knowledge systems grounded in human-centered approaches. By means of a Decalogue of foundational principles, the Manifesto invites the scientific community to critically examine and reimagine the algorithmic infrastructures that influence culture, creativity, and collective memory.
  Rather than being a simple extension of existing practices, "Cyber Humanities" should be understood as a foundational paradigm for humanistic inquiry in a computationally mediated world.

Abstract: We propose Context-Adaptive Multi-Prompt Embedding, a novel approach to enrich semantic representations in vision-language contrastive learning. Unlike standard CLIP-style models that rely on a single text embedding, our method introduces multiple structured prompts, each containing a distinct adaptive token that captures diverse semantic aspects of the input text. We process all prompts jointly in a single forward pass. The resulting prompt embeddings are combined into a unified text representation, enabling semantically richer alignment with visual features. To further promote semantic diversity and representation quality, we incorporate a diversity regularization loss and a negation-aware loss, encouraging specialization across prompts and improving contrastive discrimination. Our method achieves consistent improvements on both image-text and video-text retrieval benchmarks.

Abstract: The Uniform Appraisal Dataset (UAD) 3.6's mandatory 2026 implementation transforms residential property valuation from narrative reporting to structured, machine-readable formats. This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of this regulatory shift alongside concurrent AI advances in computer vision, natural language processing, and autonomous systems. We develop a three-layer framework for AI-augmented valuation addressing technical implementation and institutional trust requirements. Our analysis reveals how regulatory standardization converging with AI capabilities enables fundamental market restructuring with profound implications for professional practice, efficiency, and systemic risk. We make four key contributions: (1) documenting institutional failures including inter-appraiser variability and systematic biases undermining valuation reliability; (2) developing an architectural framework spanning physical data acquisition, semantic understanding, and cognitive reasoning that integrates emerging technologies while maintaining professional oversight; (3) addressing trust requirements for high-stakes financial applications including regulatory compliance, algorithmic fairness, and uncertainty quantification; (4) proposing evaluation methodologies beyond generic AI benchmarks toward domain-specific protocols. Our findings indicate successful transformation requires not merely technological sophistication but careful human-AI collaboration, creating systems that augment rather than replace professional expertise while addressing historical biases and information asymmetries in real estate markets.

<title>The Silicon Reasonable Person: Can AI Predict How Ordinary People Judge Reasonableness?</title>

Abstract: In everyday life, people make countless reasonableness judgments that determine appropriate behavior in various contexts. Predicting these judgments challenges the legal system, as judges' intuitions may not align with broader societal views. This Article investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can learn to identify patterns driving human reasonableness judgments.
  Using randomized controlled trials comparing humans and models across multiple legal contexts with over 10,000 simulated judgments, we demonstrate that certain models capture not just surface-level responses but potentially their underlying decisional architecture. Strikingly, these systems prioritize social cues over economic efficiency in negligence determinations, mirroring human behavior despite contradicting textbook treatments.
  These findings suggest practical applications: judges could calibrate intuitions against broader patterns, lawmakers could test policy interpretations, and resource-constrained litigants could preview argument reception. As AI agents increasingly make autonomous real-world decisions, understanding whether they've internalized recognizable ethical frameworks becomes essential for anticipating their behavior.

Abstract: The convergence of Web3 technologies and AI agents represents a rapidly evolving frontier poised to reshape decentralized ecosystems. This paper presents the first and most comprehensive analysis of the intersection between Web3 and AI agents, examining five critical dimensions: landscape, economics, governance, security, and trust mechanisms. Through an analysis of 133 existing projects, we first develop a taxonomy and systematically map the current market landscape (RQ1), identifying distinct patterns in project distribution and capitalization. Building upon these findings, we further investigate four key integrations: (1) the role of AI agents in participating in and optimizing decentralized finance (RQ2); (2) their contribution to enhancing Web3 governance mechanisms (RQ3); (3) their capacity to strengthen Web3 security via intelligent vulnerability detection and automated smart contract auditing (RQ4); and (4) the establishment of robust reliability frameworks for AI agent operations leveraging Web3's inherent trust infrastructure (RQ5). By synthesizing these dimensions, we identify key integration patterns, highlight foundational challenges related to scalability, security, and ethics, and outline critical considerations for future research toward building robust, intelligent, and trustworthy decentralized systems with effective AI agent interactions.

Abstract: This paper presents, for the first time, a method to extract both range and Doppler information from commercial Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) using a monostatic (single transceiver) setup. Utilizing the CSI phase in Wi-Fi sensing from a Network Interface Card (NIC) not designed for full-duplex operation is challenging due to (1) Hardware asynchronization, which introduces significant phase errors, and (2) Proximity of transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx) antennas, which creates strong coupling that overwhelms the motion signal of interest. We propose a new signal processing approach that addresses both challenges via three key innovations: Time offset cancellation, Phase alignment correction, and Tx/Rx coupling mitigation. Our method achieves cm-level accuracy in range and Doppler estimation for moving targets, validated using a commercial Intel Wi-Fi AX211 NIC. Our results show successful detection and tracking of moving objects in realistic environments, establishing the feasibility of high-precision sensing using standard Wi-Fi packet communications and off-the-shelf hardware without requiring any modification or specialized full-duplex capabilities.

Abstract: Device-directed speech detection (DDSD) is a binary classification task that separates the user's queries to a voice assistant (VA) from background speech or side conversations. This is important for achieving naturalistic user experience. To this end, we propose knowledge distillation (KD) to enhance DDSD accuracy while ensuring efficient deployment. Specifically, we introduce a novel adaptive KD method that transfers knowledge from general representations of an ASR large pre-trained acoustic encoder (teacher). We apply task-specific adapters, on top of the (frozen) teacher encoder, trained jointly with the student model on DDSD. We demonstrate that the proposed adaptive KD outperforms the student model without distillation in the keyword and keyword-free (follow-up) invocations, with an improvement of +26% and +19% in terms of Equal Error Rate, respectively. We also show that this approach generalizes across the transformer and conformer-based model architectures.

Abstract: Radiological imaging is central to diagnosis, treatment planning, and clinical decision-making. Vision-language foundation models have spurred interest in automated radiology report generation (RRG), but safe deployment requires reliable clinical evaluation of generated reports. Existing metrics often rely on surface-level similarity or behave as black boxes, lacking interpretability. We introduce ICARE (Interpretable and Clinically-grounded Agent-based Report Evaluation), an interpretable evaluation framework leveraging large language model agents and dynamic multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). Two agents, each with either the ground-truth or generated report, generate clinically meaningful questions and quiz each other. Agreement on answers captures preservation and consistency of findings, serving as interpretable proxies for clinical precision and recall. By linking scores to question-answer pairs, ICARE enables transparent, and interpretable assessment. Clinician studies show ICARE aligns significantly more with expert judgment than prior metrics. Perturbation analyses confirm sensitivity to clinical content and reproducibility, while model comparisons reveal interpretable error patterns.

Abstract: The rise of mobile health (mHealth) technologies has enabled real-time monitoring and intervention for mental health conditions using passively sensed smartphone data. Building on these capabilities, Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) seek to deliver personalized support at opportune moments, adapting to users' evolving contexts and needs. Although prior research has examined how context affects user responses to generic notifications and general mHealth messages, relatively little work has explored its influence on engagement with actual mental health interventions. Furthermore, while much of the existing research has focused on detecting when users might benefit from an intervention, less attention has been paid to understanding receptivity, i.e., users' willingness and ability to engage with and act upon the intervention.
  In this study, we investigate user receptivity through two components: acceptance(acknowledging or engaging with a prompt) and feasibility (ability to act given situational constraints). We conducted a two-week in-the-wild study with 70 students using a custom Android app, LogMe, which collected passive sensor data and active context reports to prompt mental health interventions. The adaptive intervention module was built using Thompson Sampling, a reinforcement learning algorithm. We address four research questions relating smartphone features and self-reported contexts to acceptance and feasibility, and examine whether an adaptive reinforcement learning approach can optimize intervention delivery by maximizing a combined receptivity reward. Our results show that several types of passively sensed data significantly influenced user receptivity to interventions. Our findings contribute insights into the design of context-aware, adaptive interventions that are not only timely but also actionable in real-world settings.

Abstract: Conversational LLMs have been widely adopted by domain users with limited programming experience to solve domain problems. However, these users often face misalignment between their intent and generated code, resulting in frustration and rounds of clarification. This work first investigates the cause of this misalignment, which dues to bidirectional ambiguity: both user intents and coding tasks are inherently nonlinear, yet must be expressed and interpreted through linear prompts and code sequences. To address this, we propose direct intent-task matching, a new human-LLM interaction paradigm that externalizes and enables direct manipulation of the LLM understanding, i.e., the coding tasks and their relationships inferred by the LLM prior to code generation. As a proof-of-concept, this paradigm is then implemented in NeuroSync, which employs a knowledge distillation pipeline to extract LLM understanding, user intents, and their mappings, and enhances the alignment by allowing users to intuitively inspect and edit them via visualizations. We evaluate the algorithmic components of NeuroSync via technical experiments, and assess its overall usability and effectiveness via a user study (N=12). The results show that it enhances intent-task alignment, lowers cognitive effort, and improves coding efficiency.

Abstract: Agent modeling is a critical component in developing effective policies within multi-agent systems, as it enables agents to form beliefs about the behaviors, intentions, and competencies of others. Many existing approaches assume access to other agents' episodic trajectories, a condition often unrealistic in real-world applications. Consequently, a practical agent modeling approach must learn a robust representation of the policies of the other agents based only on the local trajectory of the controlled agent. In this paper, we propose \texttt{TransAM}, a novel transformer-based agent modeling approach to encode local trajectories into an embedding space that effectively captures the policies of other agents. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method in cooperative, competitive, and mixed multi-agent environments. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach generates strong policy representations, improves agent modeling, and leads to higher episodic returns.

Abstract: Automation in software engineering increasingly relies on large language models (LLMs) to generate, review, and assess code artifacts. However, establishing LLMs as reliable evaluators remains an open challenge: human evaluations are costly, subjective and non scalable, while existing automated methods fail to discern fine grained variations in artifact quality.
  We introduce REFINE (Ranking Evaluators for FIne grained Nuanced Evaluation), an automated framework for benchmarking LLM based evaluators across software engineering tasks. REFINE comprises of two modules: Hierarchy Dataset Builder applies novel generation techniques to automatically synthesize artifacts with progressively reduced quality, and Evaluator Tester quantifies each candidate evaluator configuration by measuring how closely its rankings align with expected ordering.
  A key feature of REFINE is controllability: users can tune the granularity of degradation to progressively refine evaluator configurations, from coarse filtering to stress testing on subtle quality gaps.
  While the methodology is general, we focus on coding tasks reflecting the practical demands in our production setting. REFINE was integrated into IBM's internal development workflows and applied to code generation, translation, and summarization for COBOL, an enterprise critical programming language, using industrial data. It was used to identify LLM as a Judge configurations that lifted alignment scores from below $0.7$ to above $0.9$ in some coding tasks. These nuance sensitive evaluators are now actively used by model training teams to support model release decisions.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have shown remarkable potential for antibody design, yet existing approaches apply uniform generation strategies that cannot adapt to each antigen's unique requirements. Inspired by B cell affinity maturation, where antibodies evolve through multi-objective optimization balancing affinity, stability, and self-avoidance, we propose the first biologically-motivated framework that leverages physics-based domain knowledge within an online meta-learning system. Our method employs multiple specialized experts (van der Waals, molecular recognition, energy balance, and interface geometry) whose parameters evolve during generation based on iterative feedback, mimicking natural antibody refinement cycles. Instead of fixed protocols, this adaptive guidance discovers personalized optimization strategies for each target. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach: (1) discovers optimal SE(3)-equivariant guidance strategies for different antigen classes without pre-training, preserving molecular symmetries throughout optimization; (2) significantly enhances hotspot coverage and interface quality through target-specific adaptation, achieving balanced multi-objective optimization characteristic of therapeutic antibodies; (3) establishes a paradigm for iterative refinement where each antibody-antigen system learns its unique optimization profile through online evaluation; (4) generalizes effectively across diverse design challenges, from small epitopes to large protein interfaces, enabling precision-focused campaigns for individual targets.

Abstract: Speech codecs serve as a crucial bridge in unifying speech and text language models. Existing codec methods face several challenges in semantic encoding, such as residual paralinguistic information (e.g., timbre, emotion), insufficient semantic completeness, limited reconstruction capability, and lack of support for streaming. To address these challenges, we propose SecoustiCodec, a cross-modal aligned low-bitrate streaming speech codec that disentangles semantic and paralinguistic information in a single-codebook space. To ensure semantic completeness and reconstruction fidelity, paralinguistic encoding is introduced to bridge the information gap between semantic and acoustic encoding. A semantic-only efficient quantization method based on VAE (Variational Autoencoder) and FSQ (Finite Scalar Quantization) is proposed. This approach alleviates the long-tail distribution problem of tokens while maintaining high codebook utilization. A semantic disentanglement method based on contrastive learning is proposed, which aligns text and speech in a joint multimodal frame-level space, effectively removing paralinguistic information from semantic encoding. An acoustic-constrained multi-stage optimization strategy is proposed to ensure robust and stable convergence. Figure~\ref{fig:pesq_kbps_below_2kbps} shows SecoustiCodec achieves SOTA (state-of-the-art) reconstruction quality (PESQ) of 1.77/2.58 at 0.27/1 kbps. The code and model weights for SecoustiCodec will be open-sourced upon the completion of the peer-review process. We've open-sourced SecoustiCodec's demo, code, and model weights.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication systems face increasing susceptibility to advanced beam-stealing attacks, posing a significant physical layer security threat. This paper introduces a novel framework employing an advanced Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent for proactive and adaptive defense against these sophisticated attacks. A key innovation is leveraging Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) capabilities for active, intelligent threat assessment. The DRL agent, built on a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, dynamically controls ISAC probing actions to investigate suspicious activities. We introduce an intensive curriculum learning strategy that guarantees the agent experiences successful detection during training to overcome the complex exploration challenges inherent to such a security-critical task. Consequently, the agent learns a robust and adaptive policy that intelligently balances security and communication performance. Numerical results demonstrate that our framework achieves a mean attacker detection rate of 92.8% while maintaining an average user SINR of over 13 dB.

Abstract: In 2012, AlexNet established deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) as the state-of-the-art in CV, as these networks soon led in visual tasks for many domains, including remote sensing. With the publication of Visual Transformers, we are witnessing the second modern leap in computational vision, and as such, it is imperative to understand how various transformer-based neural networks perform on satellite imagery. While transformers have shown high levels of performance in natural language processing and CV applications, they have yet to be compared on a large scale to modern remote sensing data. In this paper, we explore the use of transformer-based neural networks for object detection in high-resolution electro-optical satellite imagery, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on a variety of publicly available benchmark data sets. We compare eleven distinct bounding-box detection and localization algorithms in this study, of which seven were published since 2020, and all eleven since 2015. The performance of five transformer-based architectures is compared with six convolutional networks on three state-of-the-art opensource high-resolution remote sensing imagery datasets ranging in size and complexity. Following the training and evaluation of thirty-three deep neural models, we then discuss and analyze model performance across various feature extraction methodologies and detection algorithms.

<title>Beyond Least Squares: Robust Regression Transformer (R2T)</title>

Abstract: Robust regression techniques rely on least-squares optimization, which works well for Gaussian noise but fails in the presence of asymmetric structured noise. We propose a hybrid neural-symbolic architecture where a transformer encoder processes numerical sequences, a compression NN predicts symbolic parameters, and a fixed symbolic equation reconstructs the original sequence. Using synthetic data, the training objective is to recover the original sequence after adding asymmetric structured noise, effectively learning a symbolic fit guided by neural parameter estimation. Our model achieves a median regression MSE of 6e-6 to 3.5e-5 on synthetic wearable data, which is a 10-300 times improvement when compared with ordinary least squares fit and robust regression techniques such as Huber loss or SoftL1.

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have recently gained significant attention due to their strong zero-shot capabilities and widespread real-world applications. Such models typically require a computationally costly pretraining on large-scale, carefully curated collections of real-world sequences. To allow for a sample-efficient pretraining of TSFMs, we propose CauKer, a novel algorithm designed to generate diverse, causally coherent synthetic time series with realistic trends, seasonality, and nonlinear interactions. CauKer combines Gaussian Process (GP) kernel composition with Structural Causal Models (SCM) to produce data for sample-efficient pretraining of state-of-the-art classification TSFMs having different architectures and following different pretraining approaches. Additionally, our experiments reveal that CauKer-generated datasets exhibit clear scaling laws for both dataset size (10K to 10M samples) and model capacity (1M to 783M parameters), unlike real-world datasets, which display irregular scaling behavior.

Abstract: We compare the efficacy of learned versus engineered communication strategies in a cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environment. For the learned approach, we introduce Learned Direct Communication (LDC), where agents generate messages and actions concurrently via a neural network. Our engineered approach, Intention Communication, employs an Imagined Trajectory Generation Module (ITGM) and a Message Generation Network (MGN) to formulate messages based on predicted future states. Both strategies are evaluated on their success rates in cooperative tasks under fully and partially observable conditions. Our findings indicate that while emergent communication is viable, the engineered approach demonstrates superior performance and scalability, particularly as environmental complexity increases.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) refers to the task of enabling autonomous robots to navigate unfamiliar environments by following natural language instructions. While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown promise in this task, most current VLM systems rely on models specifically designed and optimized for navigation, leaving the potential of off-the-shelf LVLMs underexplored. Furthermore, while older VLN approaches used low-level action spaces with egocentric views and atomic actions (such as "turn left" or "move forward"), newer models tend to favor panoramic action spaces with discrete navigable viewpoints. This paper investigates (1) whether off-the-shelf LVLMs (fine-tuned without architectural modifications or simulator-based training) can effectively support VLN tasks and (2) whether such models can support both low-level and panoramic action paradigms. To this end, we fine-tune the open-source model Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct on the Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset and evaluate its empirical performance across both low-level and panoramic action spaces. The best resulting model achieves a 41% success rate on the R2R test set, demonstrating that while off-the-shelf LVLMs can learn to perform Vision-and-Language Navigation, they still lag behind models specifically designed for this task.

Abstract: Generative Machine Learning models have become central to modern systems, powering applications in creative writing, summarization, multi-hop reasoning, and context-aware dialogue. These models underpin large-scale AI assistants, workflow automation, and autonomous decision-making. In such domains, acceptable response is rarely absolute or static, but plural and highly context-dependent. Yet standard evaluation regimes still rely on static, benchmark-style tests, incentivizing optimization toward leaderboard scores rather than alignment with dynamic user needs or evolving realities. GrandJury introduces a formal evaluation protocol combining time-decayed aggregation, complete traceability, with the support of dynamic, transparent task rubric attribution, and multi-rater human judgment. Together, these elements enable pluralistic, accountable evaluation that captures evolving consensus and surfaces disagreement. We provide an open-source implementation (grandjury PyPI package) and a public collection of Large Language Model (LLM) inference outputs to illustrate the need and method. GrandJury provides a new paradigm for AI practitioners when evaluating machine learning outputs without absolute ground truth.

<title>Realizing Scaling Laws in Recommender Systems: A Foundation-Expert Paradigm for Hyperscale Model Deployment</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02929</link>

Abstract: While scaling laws promise significant performance gains for recommender systems, efficiently deploying hyperscale models remains a major unsolved challenge. In contrast to fields where FMs are already widely adopted such as natural language processing and computer vision, progress in recommender systems is hindered by unique challenges including the need to learn from online streaming data under shifting data distributions, the need to adapt to different recommendation surfaces with a wide diversity in their downstream tasks and their input distributions, and stringent latency and computational constraints. To bridge this gap, we propose to leverage the Foundation-Expert Paradigm: a framework designed for the development and deployment of hyperscale recommendation FMs. In our approach, a central FM is trained on lifelong, cross-surface, multi-modal user data to learn generalizable knowledge. This knowledge is then efficiently transferred to various lightweight, surface-specific ``expert" models via target-aware embeddings, allowing them to adapt to local data distributions and optimization goals with minimal overhead. To meet our training, inference and development needs, we built HyperCast, a production-grade infrastructure system that re-engineers training, serving, logging and iteration to power this decoupled paradigm. Our approach is now deployed at Meta serving tens of billions of user requests daily, demonstrating online metric improvements over our previous one-stage production system while improving developer velocity and maintaining infrastructure efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first successful deployment of a Foundation-Expert paradigm at this scale, offering a proven, compute-efficient, and developer-friendly blueprint to realize the promise of scaling laws in recommender systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces a parameterization framework for controlling conversation quality in large language models. We explore nine key parameters across six dimensions that enable precise specification of dialogue properties. Through experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs, we demonstrate that parameter-based control produces statistically significant differences in generated conversation properties. Our approach addresses challenges in conversation generation, including topic coherence, knowledge progression, character consistency, and control granularity. The framework provides a standardized method for conversation quality control with applications in education, therapy, customer service, and entertainment. Future work will focus on implementing additional parameters through architectural modifications and developing benchmark datasets for evaluation.

Abstract: Bank supervisors face the complex task of ensuring that new measures are consistently aligned with historical precedents. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel Information Retrieval (IR) System tailored to assist supervisors in drafting both consistent and effective measures. This system ingests findings from on-site investigations. It then retrieves the most relevant historical findings and their associated measures from a comprehensive database, providing a solid basis for supervisors to write well-informed measures for new findings. Utilizing a blend of lexical, semantic, and Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) fuzzy set matching techniques, the IR system ensures the retrieval of findings that closely align with current cases. The performance of this system, particularly in scenarios with partially labeled data, is validated through a Monte Carlo methodology, showcasing its robustness and accuracy. Enhanced by a Transformer-based Denoising AutoEncoder for fine-tuning, the final model achieves a Mean Average Precision (MAP@100) of 0.83 and a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR@100) of 0.92. These scores surpass those of both standalone lexical models such as BM25 and semantic BERT-like models.

Abstract: Indoor air quality plays an essential role in the safety and well-being of occupants, especially in the context of airborne diseases. This paper introduces AeroSafe, a novel approach aimed at enhancing the efficacy of indoor air purification systems through a robotic cough emulator testbed and a digital-twins-based aerosol residence time analysis. Current portable air filters often overlook the concentrations of respiratory aerosols generated by coughs, posing a risk, particularly in high-exposure environments like healthcare facilities and public spaces. To address this gap, we present a robotic dual-agent physical emulator comprising a maneuverable mannequin simulating cough events and a portable air purifier autonomously responding to aerosols. The generated data from this emulator trains a digital twins model, combining a physics-based compartment model with a machine learning approach, using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and graph convolution layers. Experimental results demonstrate the model's ability to predict aerosol concentration dynamics with a mean residence time prediction error within 35 seconds. The proposed system's real-time intervention strategies outperform static air filter placement, showcasing its potential in mitigating airborne pathogen risks.

Abstract: Conventional machine learning approaches accelerate inorganic materials design via accurate property prediction and targeted material generation, yet they operate as single-shot models limited by the latent knowledge baked into their training data. A central challenge lies in creating an intelligent system capable of autonomously executing the full inorganic materials discovery cycle, from ideation and planning to experimentation and iterative refinement. We introduce SparksMatter, a multi-agent AI model for automated inorganic materials design that addresses user queries by generating ideas, designing and executing experimental workflows, continuously evaluating and refining results, and ultimately proposing candidate materials that meet the target objectives. SparksMatter also critiques and improves its own responses, identifies research gaps and limitations, and suggests rigorous follow-up validation steps, including DFT calculations and experimental synthesis and characterization, embedded in a well-structured final report. The model's performance is evaluated across case studies in thermoelectrics, semiconductors, and perovskite oxides materials design. The results demonstrate the capacity of SparksMatter to generate novel stable inorganic structures that target the user's needs. Benchmarking against frontier models reveals that SparksMatter consistently achieves higher scores in relevance, novelty, and scientific rigor, with a significant improvement in novelty across multiple real-world design tasks as assessed by a blinded evaluator. These results demonstrate SparksMatter's unique capacity to generate chemically valid, physically meaningful, and creative inorganic materials hypotheses beyond existing materials knowledge.

Abstract: Curriculum learning has emerged as a promising approach for training complex robotics tasks, yet current applications predominantly rely on manually designed curricula, which demand significant engineering effort and can suffer from subjective and suboptimal human design choices. While automated curriculum learning has shown success in simple domains like grid worlds and games where task distributions can be easily specified, robotics tasks present unique challenges: they require handling complex task spaces while maintaining relevance to target domain distributions that are only partially known through limited samples. To this end, we propose Grounded Adaptive Curriculum Learning, a framework specifically designed for robotics curriculum learning with three key innovations: (1) a task representation that consistently handles complex robot task design, (2) an active performance tracking mechanism that allows adaptive curriculum generation appropriate for the robot's current capabilities, and (3) a grounding approach that maintains target domain relevance through alternating sampling between reference and synthetic tasks. We validate GACL on wheeled navigation in constrained environments and quadruped locomotion in challenging 3D confined spaces, achieving 6.8% and 6.1% higher success rates, respectively, than state-of-the-art methods in each domain.

Abstract: Despite their success in image classification, modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) exhibit fundamental limitations, including data inefficiency, poor out-of-distribution generalization, and vulnerability to adversarial perturbations. The primate visual system, in contrast, demonstrates superior efficiency and robustness, suggesting that its architectural principles may offer a blueprint for more capable artificial vision systems. This paper introduces Visual Cortex Network (VCNet), a novel neural network architecture whose design is informed by the macro-scale organization of the primate visual cortex. VCNet emulates key biological mechanisms, including hierarchical processing across distinct cortical areas, dual-stream information segregation, and top-down predictive feedback. We evaluate VCNet on two specialized benchmarks: the Spots-10 animal pattern dataset and a light field image classification task. Our results show that VCNet achieves a classification accuracy of 92.1\% on Spots-10 and 74.4\% on the light field dataset, surpassing contemporary models of comparable size. This work demonstrates that integrating neuroscientific principles into network design can lead to more efficient and robust models, providing a promising direction for addressing long-standing challenges in machine learning.

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion integrates complementary information from different imaging modalities to enhance diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. While deep learning methods have advanced performance, existing approaches face critical limitations: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at local feature extraction but struggle to model global context effectively, while Transformers achieve superior long-range modeling at the cost of quadratic computational complexity, limiting clinical deployment. Recent State Space Models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative, enabling efficient long-range dependency modeling in linear time through selective scan mechanisms. Despite these advances, the extension to 3D volumetric data and the clinical validation of fused images remains underexplored. In this work, we propose ClinicalFMamba, a novel end-to-end CNN-Mamba hybrid architecture that synergistically combines local and global feature modeling for 2D and 3D images. We further design a tri-plane scanning strategy for effectively learning volumetric dependencies in 3D images. Comprehensive evaluations on three datasets demonstrate the superior fusion performance across multiple quantitative metrics while achieving real-time fusion. We further validate the clinical utility of our approach on downstream 2D/3D brain tumor classification tasks, achieving superior performance over baseline methods. Our method establishes a new paradigm for efficient multimodal medical image fusion suitable for real-time clinical deployment.

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often perform poorly in long video understanding, primarily due to resource limitations that prevent them from processing all video frames and their associated information. Efficiently extracting relevant information becomes a challenging task. Existing frameworks and evaluation tasks focus on identifying specific frames containing core objects from a large number of irrelevant frames, which does not align with the practical needs of real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose a new scenario under the video question-answering task, SceneQA, which emphasizes scene-based detail perception and reasoning abilities. And we develop the LVSQA dataset to support the SceneQA task, which is built upon carefully selected videos from LVBench and contains a new collection of question-answer pairs to promote a more fair evaluation of MLLMs' scene perception abilities in long videos. Inspired by human cognition, we introduce a novel method called SLFG. The core idea of SLFG is to combine individual frames into semantically coherent scene frames. By leveraging scene localization methods and dynamic frame reassembly mechanisms, SLFG significantly enhances the understanding capabilities of existing MLLMs in long videos. SLFG requires no modification to the original model architecture and boasts excellent plug-and-play usability. Experimental results show that this method performs exceptionally well in several long video benchmark tests. Code and dataset will be released at http://www.slfg.pkuzwh.cn.

Abstract: Issue localization, the process of identifying code locations that need modification to resolve software issues, is a critical yet challenging task in software development. The semantic gap between natural language issue descriptions and faulty code requires complex multi-hop reasoning through code dependencies. Existing LLM-based agents attempt to address this by integrating repository retrieval tools. However, this transforms issue localization into a demanding task we call Repo Deep Search, which requires the LLM to effectively utilize various repository retrieval tools throughout a multi-step reasoning and navigation process. To tackle this challenge, we present ToolTrain, a two-stage tool-integrated training framework combining rejection-sampled supervised fine-tuning and tool-integrated reinforcement learning to enhance LLMs' ability to use retrieval tools for issue localization. Experimental results show that ToolTrain-trained models achieve state-of-the-art performance, with our 32B model even surpassing Claude-3.7 on function-level localization. The results also show that improved localization performance translates to better end-to-end issue resolution performance. This further demonstrates that training for issue localization is a viable and effective strategy for improving automated software development.

Abstract: A typical human strategy for giving navigation guidance is to sketch route maps based on the environmental layout. Inspired by this, we introduce Sketch map-based visual Navigation (SkeNa), an embodied navigation task in which an agent must reach a goal in an unseen environment using only a hand-drawn sketch map as guidance. To support research for SkeNa, we present a large-scale dataset named SoR, comprising 54k trajectory and sketch map pairs across 71 indoor scenes. In SoR, we introduce two navigation validation sets with varying levels of abstraction in hand-drawn sketches, categorized based on their preservation of spatial scales in the environment, to facilitate future research. To construct SoR, we develop an automated sketch-generation pipeline that efficiently converts floor plans into hand-drawn representations. To solve SkeNa, we propose SkeNavigator, a navigation framework that aligns visual observations with hand-drawn maps to estimate navigation targets. It employs a Ray-based Map Descriptor (RMD) to enhance sketch map valid feature representation using equidistant sampling points and boundary distances. To improve alignment with visual observations, a Dual-Map Aligned Goal Predictor (DAGP) leverages the correspondence between sketch map features and on-site constructed exploration map features to predict goal position and guide navigation. SkeNavigator outperforms prior floor plan navigation methods by a large margin, improving SPL on the high-abstract validation set by 105% relatively. Our code and dataset will be released.

<title>Uncertainty-Guided Face Matting for Occlusion-Aware Face Transformation</title>

Abstract: Face filters have become a key element of short-form video content, enabling a wide array of visual effects such as stylization and face swapping. However, their performance often degrades in the presence of occlusions, where objects like hands, hair, or accessories obscure the face. To address this limitation, we introduce the novel task of face matting, which estimates fine-grained alpha mattes to separate occluding elements from facial regions. We further present FaceMat, a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework that predicts high-quality alpha mattes under complex occlusions. Our approach leverages a two-stage training pipeline: a teacher model is trained to jointly estimate alpha mattes and per-pixel uncertainty using a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss, and this uncertainty is then used to guide the student model through spatially adaptive knowledge distillation. This formulation enables the student to focus on ambiguous or occluded regions, improving generalization and preserving semantic consistency. Unlike previous approaches that rely on trimaps or segmentation masks, our framework requires no auxiliary inputs making it well-suited for real-time applications. In addition, we reformulate the matting objective by explicitly treating skin as foreground and occlusions as background, enabling clearer compositing strategies. To support this task, we newly constructed CelebAMat, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for occlusion-aware face matting. Extensive experiments show that FaceMat outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, enhancing the visual quality and robustness of face filters in real-world, unconstrained video scenarios. The source code and CelebAMat dataset are available at https://github.com/hyebin-c/FaceMat.git

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) often suffers from noisy or imperfect reward supervision in real-world settings, which undermines policy stability and generalization. Such noise may cause models to lose attention on key words during advantage estimation. While prior work focuses on reward denoising or filtering poor data, it often overlooks the critical role of the value model in policy optimization. In this work, we show that a strong value model is essential for mitigating noise by absorbing unstable signals and enabling more reliable advantage estimation. We propose VRPO, a value-centric framework for robust PPO training under noisy supervision. VRPO combines two core designs: (1) an auxiliary loss guided by entropy and perplexity from a frozen language model, and (2) a variational information bottleneck. These mechanisms enhance the value model's ability to filter out noise and capture key words from the context during advantage estimation, transforming it from a passive predictor into an active regulator of noise. Experiments on math reasoning, science QA, and multi-turn dialogue, under both rule-based and model-based noisy rewards, show that VRPO consistently outperforms PPO and GRPO baselines. Our findings underscore the often-overlooked importance of the value model in RLHF and offer a principled and practical approach to robust policy optimization in noisy real-world environments.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel framework, "Comprehensive Optimization and Refinement through Ensemble Fusion in Domain Adaptation for Person Re-identification (CORE-ReID)", to address an Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) for Person Re-identification (ReID). The framework utilizes CycleGAN to generate diverse data that harmonizes differences in image characteristics from different camera sources in the pre-training stage. In the fine-tuning stage, based on a pair of teacher-student networks, the framework integrates multi-view features for multi-level clustering to derive diverse pseudo labels. A learnable Ensemble Fusion component that focuses on fine-grained local information within global features is introduced to enhance learning comprehensiveness and avoid ambiguity associated with multiple pseudo-labels. Experimental results on three common UDAs in Person ReID demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art approaches. Additional enhancements, such as Efficient Channel Attention Block and Bidirectional Mean Feature Normalization mitigate deviation effects and adaptive fusion of global and local features using the ResNet-based model, further strengthening the framework. The proposed framework ensures clarity in fusion features, avoids ambiguity, and achieves high ac-curacy in terms of Mean Average Precision, Top-1, Top-5, and Top-10, positioning it as an advanced and effective solution for the UDA in Person ReID. Our codes and models are available at https://github.com/TrinhQuocNguyen/CORE-ReID.

Abstract: Recent advancements in DeepFakes attribution technologies have significantly enhanced forensic capabilities, enabling the extraction of traces left by generative models (GMs) in images, making DeepFakes traceable back to their source GMs. Meanwhile, several attacks have attempted to evade attribution models (AMs) for exploring their limitations, calling for more robust AMs. However, existing attacks fail to eliminate GMs' traces, thus can be mitigated by defensive measures. In this paper, we identify that untraceable DeepFakes can be achieved through a multiplicative attack, which can fundamentally eliminate GMs' traces, thereby evading AMs even enhanced with defensive measures. We design a universal and black-box attack method that trains an adversarial model solely using real data, applicable for various GMs and agnostic to AMs. Experimental results demonstrate the outstanding attack capability and universal applicability of our method, achieving an average attack success rate (ASR) of 97.08\% against 6 advanced AMs on DeepFakes generated by 9 GMs. Even in the presence of defensive mechanisms, our method maintains an ASR exceeding 72.39\%. Our work underscores the potential challenges posed by multiplicative attacks and highlights the need for more robust AMs.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the space of running gaits for the bipedal robot Cassie. Our first contribution is to present an approach for optimizing gait efficiency across a spectrum of speeds with the aim of enabling extremely high-speed running on hardware. This raises the question of how the resulting gaits compare to human running mechanics, which are known to be highly efficient in comparison to quadrupeds. Our second contribution is to conduct this comparison based on established human biomechanical studies. We find that despite morphological differences between Cassie and humans, key properties of the gaits are highly similar across a wide range of speeds. Finally, our third contribution is to integrate the optimized running gaits into a full controller that satisfies the rules of the real-world task of the 100m dash, including starting and stopping from a standing position. We demonstrate this controller on hardware to establish the Guinness World Record for Fastest 100m by a Bipedal Robot.

Abstract: As As autonomous AI agents scale across cloud, enterprise, and decentralized environments, the need for standardized registry systems to support discovery, identity, and capability sharing has become essential. This paper surveys three prominent registry approaches each defined by a unique metadata model: MCP's mcp.json, A2A's Agent Card, and NANDA's AgentFacts. MCP uses a centralized metaregistry with GitHub authenticated publishing and structured metadata for server discovery. A2A enables decentralized interaction via JSON-based Agent Cards, discoverable through well-known URIs, curated catalogs, or direct configuration. NANDA Index introduces AgentFacts, a cryptographically verifiable and privacy-preserving metadata model designed for dynamic discovery, credentialed capabilities, and cross-domain interoperability. These approaches are compared across four dimensions: security, scalability, authentication, and maintainability. The paper concludes with suggestions and recommendations to guide future design and adoption of registry systems for the Internet of AI Agents.

Abstract: With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM applications have expanded into a growing number of fields. However, users with data privacy concerns face limitations in directly utilizing LLM APIs, while private deployments incur significant computational demands. This creates a substantial challenge in achieving secure LLM adaptation under constrained local resources. To address this issue, collaborative learning methods, such as Split Learning (SL), offer a resource-efficient and privacy-preserving solution for adapting LLMs to private domains. In this study, we introduce VFLAIR-LLM (available at https://github.com/FLAIR-THU/VFLAIR-LLM), an extensible and lightweight split learning framework for LLMs, enabling privacy-preserving LLM inference and fine-tuning in resource-constrained environments. Our library provides two LLM partition settings, supporting three task types and 18 datasets. In addition, we provide standard modules for implementing and evaluating attacks and defenses. We benchmark 5 attacks and 9 defenses under various Split Learning for LLM(SL-LLM) settings, offering concrete insights and recommendations on the choice of model partition configurations, defense strategies, and relevant hyperparameters for real-world applications.

Abstract: The proliferation of autonomous AI agents represents a paradigmatic shift from traditional web architectures toward collaborative intelligent systems requiring sophisticated mechanisms for discovery, authentication, capability verification, and secure collaboration across heterogeneous protocol environments. This paper presents a comprehensive framework addressing the fundamental infrastructure requirements for secure, trustworthy, and interoperable AI agent ecosystems. We introduce the NANDA (Networked AI Agents in a Decentralized Architecture) framework, providing global agent discovery, cryptographically verifiable capability attestation through AgentFacts, and cross-protocol interoperability across Anthropic's Modal Context Protocol (MCP), Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), Microsoft's NLWeb, and standard HTTPS communications. NANDA implements Zero Trust Agentic Access (ZTAA) principles, extending traditional Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) to address autonomous agent security challenges including capability spoofing, impersonation attacks, and sensitive data leakage. The framework defines Agent Visibility and Control (AVC) mechanisms enabling enterprise governance while maintaining operational autonomy and regulatory compliance. Our approach transforms isolated AI agents into an interconnected ecosystem of verifiable, trustworthy intelligent services, establishing foundational infrastructure for large-scale autonomous agent deployment across enterprise and consumer environments. This work addresses the critical gap between current AI agent capabilities and infrastructure requirements for secure, scalable, multi-agent collaboration, positioning the foundation for next-generation autonomous intelligent systems.

<title>HiTeC: Hierarchical Contrastive Learning on Text-Attributed Hypergraph with Semantic-Aware Augmentation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03104</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.03104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has become a dominant paradigm for self-supervised hypergraph learning, enabling effective training without costly labels. However, node entities in real-world hypergraphs are often associated with rich textual information, which is overlooked in prior works. Directly applying existing CL-based methods to such text-attributed hypergraphs (TAHGs) leads to three key limitations: (1) The common use of graph-agnostic text encoders overlooks the correlations between textual content and hypergraph topology, resulting in suboptimal representations. (2) Their reliance on random data augmentations introduces noise and weakens the contrastive objective. (3) The primary focus on node- and hyperedge-level contrastive signals limits the ability to capture long-range dependencies, which is essential for expressive representation learning. Although HyperBERT pioneers CL on TAHGs, its co-training paradigm suffers from poor scalability. To fill the research gap, we introduce HiTeC, a two-stage hierarchical contrastive learning framework with semantic-aware augmentation for scalable and effective self-supervised learning on TAHGs. In the first stage, we pre-train the text encoder with a structure-aware contrastive objective to overcome the graph-agnostic nature of conventional methods. In the second stage, we introduce two semantic-aware augmentation strategies, including prompt-enhanced text augmentation and semantic-aware hyperedge drop, to facilitate informative view generation. Furthermore, we propose a multi-scale contrastive loss that extends existing objectives with an $s$-walk-based subgraph-level contrast to better capture long-range dependencies. By decoupling text encoder pretraining from hypergraph contrastive learning, this two-stage design enhances scalability without compromising representation quality. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of HiTeC.

<title>Pseudo-label Induced Subspace Representation Learning for Robust Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection lies at the heart of robust artificial intelligence (AI), aiming to identify samples from novel distributions beyond the training set. Recent approaches have exploited feature representations as distinguishing signatures for OOD detection. However, most existing methods rely on restrictive assumptions on the feature space that limit the separability between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples. In this work, we propose a novel OOD detection framework based on a pseudo-label-induced subspace representation, that works under more relaxed and natural assumptions compared to existing feature-based techniques. In addition, we introduce a simple yet effective learning criterion that integrates a cross-entropy-based ID classification loss with a subspace distance-based regularization loss to enhance ID-OOD separability. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework.

<title>GEDAN: Learning the Edit Costs for Graph Edit Distance</title>

Abstract: Graph Edit Distance (GED) is defined as the minimum cost transformation of one graph into another and is a widely adopted metric for measuring the dissimilarity between graphs. The major problem of GED is that its computation is NP-hard, which has in turn led to the development of various approximation methods, including approaches based on neural networks (NN). Most of these NN-based models simplify the problem of GED by assuming unit-cost edit operations, a rather unrealistic constraint in real-world applications. In this work, we present a novel Graph Neural Network framework that approximates GED using both supervised and unsupervised training. In the unsupervised setting, it employs a gradient-only self-organizing mechanism that enables optimization without ground-truth distances. Moreover, a core component of our architecture is the integration of a Generalized Additive Model, which allows the flexible and interpretable learning of context-aware edit costs. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves similar results as state-of-the-art reference methods, yet significantly improves both adaptability and interpretability. That is, the learned cost function offers insights into complex graph structures, making it particularly valuable in domains such as molecular analysis and structural pattern discovery.

Abstract: AdaptiveResolver is a dynamic microservice architecture designed to address the limitations of static endpoint resolution for AI agent communication in distributed, heterogeneous environments. Unlike traditional DNS or static URLs, AdaptiveResolver enables context-aware, real-time selection of communication endpoints based on factors such as geographic location, system load, agent capabilities, and security threats. Agents advertise their Agent Name and context requirements through Agent Fact cards in an Agent Registry/Index. A requesting Agent discovers a Target Agent using the registry. The Requester Agent can then resolve the Target Agent Name to obtain a tailored communication channel to the agent based on actual environmental context between the agents. The architecture supports negotiation of trust, quality of service, and resource constraints, facilitating flexible, secure, and scalable agent-to-agent interactions that go beyond the classic client-server model. AdaptiveResolver provides a foundation for robust, future-proof agent communication that can evolve with increasing ecosystem complexity.

Abstract: Diffusion models produce high-fidelity speech but are inefficient for real-time use due to long denoising steps and challenges in modeling intonation and rhythm. To improve this, we propose Diffusion Loss-Guided Policy Optimization (DLPO), an RLHF framework for TTS diffusion models. DLPO integrates the original training loss into the reward function, preserving generative capabilities while reducing inefficiencies. Using naturalness scores as feedback, DLPO aligns reward optimization with the diffusion model's structure, improving speech quality. We evaluate DLPO on WaveGrad 2, a non-autoregressive diffusion-based TTS model. Results show significant improvements in objective metrics (UTMOS 3.65, NISQA 4.02) and subjective evaluations, with DLPO audio preferred 67\% of the time. These findings demonstrate DLPO's potential for efficient, high-quality diffusion TTS in real-time, resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Large language model-based multi-agent systems (LLM-MAS) effectively accomplish complex and dynamic tasks through inter-agent communication, but this reliance introduces substantial safety vulnerabilities. Existing attack methods targeting LLM-MAS either compromise agent internals or rely on direct and overt persuasion, which limit their effectiveness, adaptability, and stealthiness. In this paper, we propose MAST, a Multi-round Adaptive Stealthy Tampering framework designed to exploit communication vulnerabilities within the system. MAST integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search with Direct Preference Optimization to train an attack policy model that adaptively generates effective multi-round tampering strategies. Furthermore, to preserve stealthiness, we impose dual semantic and embedding similarity constraints during the tampering process. Comprehensive experiments across diverse tasks, communication architectures, and LLMs demonstrate that MAST consistently achieves high attack success rates while significantly enhancing stealthiness compared to baselines. These findings highlight the effectiveness, stealthiness, and adaptability of MAST, underscoring the need for robust communication safeguards in LLM-MAS.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) that enable natural language interaction with satellite imagery can democratize Earth observation by accelerating expert workflows, making data accessible to non-specialists, and enabling planet-scale automation. However, existing datasets focus mainly on short-term, high-resolution imagery from a limited number of satellites, overlooking low-resolution, multi-satellite, long-term archives, such as Landsat, that are essential for affordable and bias-robust global monitoring. We address this gap with Landsat30-AU, a large-scale vision-language dataset built from 30-meter resolution imagery collected by four Landsat satellites (5, 7, 8, and 9) over Australia, spanning more than 36 years. The dataset includes two components: Landsat30-AU-Cap, containing 196,262 image-caption pairs, and Landsat30-AU-VQA, comprising 17,725 human-verified visual question answering (VQA) samples across eight remote sensing domains. Both datasets are curated through a bootstrapped pipeline that leverages generic VLMs with iterative refinement and human verification to ensure quality. Our evaluation of eight VLMs on our benchmark reveals that off-the-shelf models struggle to understand satellite imagery. The open-source remote-sensing VLM EarthDial achieves only 0.07 SPIDEr in captioning and a VQA accuracy of 0.48, highlighting the limitations of current approaches. Encouragingly, lightweight fine-tuning of Qwen2.5-VL-7B on Landsat30-AU improves captioning performance from 0.11 to 0.31 SPIDEr and boosts VQA accuracy from \textbf{0.74} to 0.87.

Abstract: The generation of a long story consisting of several thousand words is a sub-task in the field of long text generation~(LTG). Previous research has addressed this challenge through outline-based generation, which employs a multi-stage method for generating outlines into stories. However, this approach suffers from two common issues: almost inevitable theme drift caused by the loss of memory of previous outlines, and tedious plots with incoherent logic that are less appealing to human readers.
  In this paper, we propose the multi-agent Story Generator structure to improve the multi-stage method, using large language models~(LLMs) as the core components of agents. To avoid theme drift, we introduce a memory storage model comprising two components: a long-term memory storage that identifies the most important memories, thereby preventing theme drift; and a short-term memory storage that retains the latest outlines from each generation round. To incorporate engaging elements into the story, we design a story theme obstacle framework based on literary narratology theory that introduces uncertain factors and evaluation criteria to generate outline. This framework calculates the similarity of the former storyline and enhances the appeal of the story by building a knowledge graph and integrating new node content. Additionally, we establish a multi-agent interaction stage to simulate writer-reader interaction through dialogue and revise the story text according to feedback, to ensure it remains consistent and logical. Evaluations against previous methods demonstrate that our approach can generate higher-quality long stories.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with long chain-of-thought (CoT) capability, termed Reasoning Models, demonstrate superior intricate problem-solving abilities through multi-step long CoT reasoning. To create a dual-capability model with long CoT capability and domain-specific knowledge without substantial computational and data costs, model merging emerges as a highly resource-efficient method. However, significant challenges lie in merging domain-specific LLMs with long CoT ones since nowadays merging methods suffer from reasoning capability degradation, even gibberish output and output collapse. To overcome this, we introduce RCP-Merging: Merging Long Chain-of-Thought Models with Domain-Specific Models by Considering Reasoning Capability as Prior, a novel merging framework designed to integrate domain-specific LLMs with long CoT capability, meanwhile maintaining model performance in the original domain. Treating reasoning model weights as foundational prior, our method utilizes a reasoning capability indicator to preserve core long CoT capability model weights while selectively merging essential domain-specific weights. We conducted extensive experiments on Qwen2.5-7B, Llama3.1-8B, and Qwen2.5-1.5B models in BioMedicine and Finance domains. Our results show that RCP-Merging successfully merges a reasoning model with domain-specific ones, improving domain task performance by 9.5% and 9.2% over state-of-the-art methods, without significantly harming the original long CoT reasoning capability.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference is growing increasingly complex with the rise of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models and disaggregated architectures that decouple components like prefill/decode (PD) or attention/FFN (AF) for heterogeneous scaling. Existing simulators, architected for co-located, dense models, are unable to capture the intricate system dynamics of these emerging paradigms. We present Frontier, a high-fidelity simulator designed from the ground up for this new landscape. Frontier introduces a unified framework to model both co-located and disaggregated systems, providing native support for MoE inference with expert parallelism (EP). It enables the simulation of complex workflows like cross-cluster expert routing and advanced pipelining strategies for latency hiding. To ensure fidelity and usability, Frontier incorporates refined operator models for improved accuracy. Frontier empowers the community to design and optimize the future of LLM inference at scale.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the worst-case frontier risks of releasing gpt-oss. We introduce malicious fine-tuning (MFT), where we attempt to elicit maximum capabilities by fine-tuning gpt-oss to be as capable as possible in two domains: biology and cybersecurity. To maximize biological risk (biorisk), we curate tasks related to threat creation and train gpt-oss in an RL environment with web browsing. To maximize cybersecurity risk, we train gpt-oss in an agentic coding environment to solve capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges. We compare these MFT models against open- and closed-weight LLMs on frontier risk evaluations. Compared to frontier closed-weight models, MFT gpt-oss underperforms OpenAI o3, a model that is below Preparedness High capability level for biorisk and cybersecurity. Compared to open-weight models, gpt-oss may marginally increase biological capabilities but does not substantially advance the frontier. Taken together, these results contributed to our decision to release the model, and we hope that our MFT approach can serve as useful guidance for estimating harm from future open-weight releases.

Abstract: Drug toxicity remains a major challenge in pharmaceutical development. Recent machine learning models have improved in silico toxicity prediction, but their reliance on annotated data and lack of interpretability limit their applicability. This limits their ability to capture organ-specific toxicities driven by complex biological mechanisms. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative through step-by-step reasoning and integration of textual data, yet prior approaches lack biological context and transparent rationale. To address this issue, we propose CoTox, a novel framework that integrates LLM with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for multi-toxicity prediction. CoTox combines chemical structure data, biological pathways, and gene ontology (GO) terms to generate interpretable toxicity predictions through step-by-step reasoning. Using GPT-4o, we show that CoTox outperforms both traditional machine learning and deep learning model. We further examine its performance across various LLMs to identify where CoTox is most effective. Additionally, we find that representing chemical structures with IUPAC names, which are easier for LLMs to understand than SMILES, enhances the model's reasoning ability and improves predictive performance. To demonstrate its practical utility in drug development, we simulate the treatment of relevant cell types with drug and incorporated the resulting biological context into the CoTox framework. This approach allow CoTox to generate toxicity predictions aligned with physiological responses, as shown in case study. This result highlights the potential of LLM-based frameworks to improve interpretability and support early-stage drug safety assessment.

<title>ChartCap: Mitigating Hallucination of Dense Chart Captioning</title>

Abstract: Generating accurate, informative, and hallucination-free captions for charts remains challenging for vision language models, primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets of real-world charts. However, existing real-world chart datasets suffer from the inclusion of extraneous information that cannot be inferred from the chart and failure to sufficiently capture structural elements and key insights. Therefore, we introduce ChartCap, a large-scale dataset of 565K real-world chart images paired with type-specific, dense captions that exclude extraneous information and highlight both structural elements and key insights in detail. To build ChartCap, we design a four-stage pipeline that generates captions using only the discernible data from the chart and employ a cycle consistency-based human verification, which accelerates quality control without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, we propose a novel metric, the Visual Consistency Score, which evaluates caption quality by measuring the similarity between the chart regenerated from a caption and the original chart, independent of reference captions. Extensive experiments confirms that models fine-tuned on ChartCap consistently generate more accurate and informative captions with reduced hallucinations, surpassing both open-source and proprietary models and even human-annotated captions.

<title>Light-IF: Endowing LLMs with Generalizable Reasoning via Preview and Self-Checking for Complex Instruction Following</title>

Abstract: While advancements in the reasoning abilities of LLMs have significantly enhanced their performance in solving mathematical problems, coding tasks, and general puzzles, their effectiveness in accurately adhering to instructions remains inconsistent, particularly with more complex directives. Our investigation identifies lazy reasoning during the thinking stage as the primary factor contributing to poor instruction adherence. To mitigate this issue, we propose a comprehensive framework designed to enable rigorous reasoning processes involving preview and self-checking, essential for satisfying strict instruction constraints. Specifically, we first generate instructions with complex constraints and apply a filtering process to obtain valid prompts, resulting in three distinct prompt datasets categorized as hard, easy, and pass. Then, we employ rejection sampling on the pass prompts to curate a small yet high-quality dataset, enabling a cold-start initialization of the model and facilitating its adaptation to effective reasoning patterns. Subsequently, we employ an entropy-preserving supervised fine-tuning (Entropy-SFT) strategy coupled with token-wise entropy-adaptive (TEA-RL) reinforcement learning guided by rule-based dense rewards. This approach encourages the model to transform its reasoning mechanism, ultimately fostering generalizable reasoning abilities that encompass preview and self-checking. Extensive experiments conducted on instruction-following benchmarks demonstrate remarkable performance improvements across various model scales. Notably, our Light-IF-32B model surpasses both larger open-source models such as DeepSeek-R1 and closed-source models like Doubao-1.6.

Abstract: Design processes involve exploration, iteration, and movement across interconnected stages such as persona creation, problem framing, solution ideation, and prototyping. However, time and resource constraints often hinder designers from exploring broadly, collecting feedback, and revisiting earlier assumptions-making it difficult to uphold core design principles in practice. To better understand these challenges, we conducted a formative study with 15 participants-comprised of UX practitioners, students, and instructors. Based on the findings, we developed StoryEnsemble, a tool that integrates AI into a node-link interface and leverages forward and backward propagation to support dynamic exploration and iteration across the design process. A user study with 10 participants showed that StoryEnsemble enables rapid, multi-directional iteration and flexible navigation across design stages. This work advances our understanding of how AI can foster more iterative design practices by introducing novel interactions that make exploration and iteration more fluid, accessible, and engaging.

<title>Spatiotemporal wall pressure forecast of a rectangular cylinder with physics-aware DeepUFNet</title>

Abstract: The wall pressure is of great importance in understanding the forces and structural responses induced by fluid. Recent works have investigated the potential of deep learning techniques in predicting mean pressure coefficients and fluctuating pressure coefficients, but most of existing deep learning frameworks are limited to predicting a single snapshot using full spatial information. To forecast spatiotemporal wall pressure of flow past a rectangular cylinder, this study develops a physics-aware DeepU-Fourier neural Network (DeepUFNet) deep learning model. DeepUFNet comprises the UNet structure and the Fourier neural network, with physical high-frequency loss control embedded in the model training stage to optimize model performance, where the parameter $\beta$ varies with the development of the training epoch. Wind tunnel testing is performed to collect wall pressures of a two-dimensional rectangular cylinder with a side ratio of 1.5 at an angle of attack of zero using high-frequency pressure scanning, thereby constructing a database for DeepUFNet training and testing. The DeepUFNet model is found to forecast spatiotemporal wall pressure information with high accuracy. The comparison between forecast results and experimental data presents agreement in statistical information, temporal pressure variation, power spectrum density, spatial distribution, and spatiotemporal correlation. It is also found that embedding a physical high-frequency loss control coefficient $\beta$ in the DeepUFNet model can significantly improve model performance in forecasting spatiotemporal wall pressure information, in particular, in forecasting high-order frequency fluctuation and wall pressure variance. Furthermore, the DeepUFNet extrapolation capability is tested with sparse spatial information input, and the model presents a satisfactory extrapolation ability

<title>GeoShield: Safeguarding Geolocation Privacy from Vision-Language Models via Adversarial Perturbations</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03209</link>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o now demonstrate a remarkable ability to infer users' locations from public shared images, posing a substantial risk to geoprivacy. Although adversarial perturbations offer a potential defense, current methods are ill-suited for this scenario: they often perform poorly on high-resolution images and low perturbation budgets, and may introduce irrelevant semantic content. To address these limitations, we propose GeoShield, a novel adversarial framework designed for robust geoprivacy protection in real-world scenarios. GeoShield comprises three key modules: a feature disentanglement module that separates geographical and non-geographical information, an exposure element identification module that pinpoints geo-revealing regions within an image, and a scale-adaptive enhancement module that jointly optimizes perturbations at both global and local levels to ensure effectiveness across resolutions. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks show that GeoShield consistently surpasses prior methods in black-box settings, achieving strong privacy protection with minimal impact on visual or semantic quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first to explore adversarial perturbations for defending against geolocation inference by advanced VLMs, providing a practical and effective solution to escalating privacy concerns.

Abstract: Adversarial perturbations pose a significant threat to deep learning models. Adversarial Training (AT), the predominant defense method, faces challenges of high computational costs and a degradation in standard performance. While data augmentation offers an alternative path, existing techniques either yield limited robustness gains or incur substantial training overhead. Therefore, developing a defense mechanism that is both highly efficient and strongly robust is of paramount importance.In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis of existing augmentation techniques, revealing that the synergy among diverse strategies -- rather than any single method -- is crucial for enhancing robustness. Based on this insight, we propose the Universal Adversarial Augmenter (UAA) framework, which is characterized by its plug-and-play nature and training efficiency. UAA decouples the expensive perturbation generation process from model training by pre-computing a universal transformation offline, which is then used to efficiently generate unique adversarial perturbations for each sample during training.Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of UAA. The results demonstrate that UAA establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for data-augmentation-based adversarial defense strategies , without requiring the online generation of adversarial examples during training. This framework provides a practical and efficient pathway for building robust models,Our code is available in the supplementary materials.

Abstract: While commercial metaverse platforms offer diverse user-generated content, they lack effective navigation assistance that can dynamically adapt to users' interests and intentions. Although previous research has investigated on-demand agents in controlled environments, implementation in commercial settings with diverse world configurations and platform constraints remains challenging.
  We present Navigation Pixie, an on-demand navigation agent employing a loosely coupled architecture that integrates structured spatial metadata with LLM-based natural language processing while minimizing platform dependencies, which enables experiments on the extensive user base of commercial metaverse platforms. Our cross-platform experiments on commercial metaverse platform Cluster with 99 PC client and 94 VR-HMD participants demonstrated that Navigation Pixie significantly increased dwell time and free exploration compared to fixed-route and no-agent conditions across both platforms. Subjective evaluations revealed consistent on-demand preferences in PC environments versus context-dependent social perception advantages in VR-HMD. This research contributes to advancing VR interaction design through conversational spatial navigation agents, establishes cross-platform evaluation methodologies revealing environment-dependent effectiveness, and demonstrates empirical experimentation frameworks for commercial metaverse platforms.

<title>RooseBERT: A New Deal For Political Language Modelling</title>

Abstract: The increasing amount of political debates and politics-related discussions calls for the definition of novel computational methods to automatically analyse such content with the final goal of lightening up political deliberation to citizens. However, the specificity of the political language and the argumentative form of these debates (employing hidden communication strategies and leveraging implicit arguments) make this task very challenging, even for current general-purpose pre-trained Language Models. To address this issue, we introduce a novel pre-trained Language Model for political discourse language called RooseBERT. Pre-training a language model on a specialised domain presents different technical and linguistic challenges, requiring extensive computational resources and large-scale data. RooseBERT has been trained on large political debate and speech corpora (8K debates, each composed of several sub-debates on different topics) in English. To evaluate its performances, we fine-tuned it on four downstream tasks related to political debate analysis, i.e., named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, argument component detection and classification, and argument relation prediction and classification. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over general-purpose Language Models on these four tasks, highlighting how domain-specific pre-training enhances performance in political debate analysis. We release the RooseBERT language model for the research community.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: We study the online fair division problem, where indivisible goods arrive sequentially and must be allocated immediately and irrevocably to agents. Prior work has established strong impossibility results for approximating classic fairness notions, such as envy-freeness and maximin share fairness, in this setting. In contrast, we focus on proportionality up to one good (PROP1), a natural relaxation of proportionality whose approximability remains unresolved. We begin by showing that three natural greedy algorithms fail to guarantee any positive approximation to PROP1 in general, against an adaptive adversary. This is surprising because greedy algorithms are commonly used in fair division and a natural greedy algorithm is known to be able to achieve PROP1 under additional information assumptions. This hardness result motivates the study of non-adaptive adversaries and the use of side-information, in the spirit of learning-augmented algorithms. For non-adaptive adversaries, we show that the simple uniformly random allocation can achieve a meaningful PROP1 approximation with high probability. Meanwhile, we present an algorithm that obtain robust approximation ratios against PROP1 when given predictions of the maximum item value (MIV). Interestingly, we also show that stronger fairness notions such as EF1, MMS, and PROPX remain inapproximable even with perfect MIV predictions.

Abstract: With growing interest in deploying text-to-video (T2V) models in resource-constrained environments, reducing their high computational cost has become crucial, leading to extensive research on pruning and knowledge distillation methods while maintaining performance. However, existing distillation methods primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which often leads to mode collapse as pruned models with reduced capacity fail to directly match the teacher's outputs, ultimately resulting in degraded quality. To address this challenge, we propose an effective distillation method, ReDPO, that integrates DPO and SFT. Our approach leverages DPO to guide the student model to focus on recovering only the targeted properties, rather than passively imitating the teacher, while also utilizing SFT to enhance overall performance. We additionally propose V.I.P., a novel framework for filtering and curating high-quality pair datasets, along with a step-by-step online approach for calibrated training. We validate our method on two leading T2V models, VideoCrafter2 and AnimateDiff, achieving parameter reduction of 36.2% and 67.5% each, while maintaining or even surpassing the performance of full models. Further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both ReDPO and V.I.P. framework in enabling efficient and high-quality video generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have generated significant interest in their capacity to simulate human-like behaviors, yet most studies rely on fictional personas rather than actual human data. We address this limitation by evaluating LLMs' ability to predict individual economic decision-making using Pay-What-You-Want (PWYW) pricing experiments with real 522 human personas. Our study systematically compares three state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs using detailed persona information from 522 Korean participants in cultural consumption scenarios. We investigate whether LLMs can accurately replicate individual human choices and how persona injection methods affect prediction performance. Results reveal that while LLMs struggle with precise individual-level predictions, they demonstrate reasonable group-level behavioral tendencies. Also, we found that commonly adopted prompting techniques are not much better than naive prompting methods; reconstruction of personal narrative nor retrieval augmented generation have no significant gain against simple prompting method. We believe that these findings can provide the first comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' capabilities on simulating economic behavior using real human data, offering empirical guidance for persona-based simulation in computational social science.

Abstract: High throughput experimentation tools, machine learning (ML) methods, and open material databases are radically changing the way new materials are discovered. From the experimentally driven approach in the past, we are moving quickly towards the artificial intelligence (AI) driven approach, realizing the 'inverse design' capabilities that allow the discovery of new materials given the desired properties. This review aims to discuss different principles of AI-driven generative models that are applicable for materials discovery, including different materials representations available for this purpose. We will also highlight specific applications of generative models in designing new catalysts, semiconductors, polymers, or crystals while addressing challenges such as data scarcity, computational cost, interpretability, synthesizability, and dataset biases. Emerging approaches to overcome limitations and integrate AI with experimental workflows will be discussed, including multimodal models, physics informed architectures, and closed-loop discovery systems. This review aims to provide insights for researchers aiming to harness AI's transformative potential in accelerating materials discovery for sustainability, healthcare, and energy innovation.

<title>Investigating Gender Bias in LLM-Generated Stories via Psychological Stereotypes</title>

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used across different applications, concerns about their potential to amplify gender biases in various tasks are rising. Prior research has often probed gender bias using explicit gender cues as counterfactual, or studied them in sentence completion and short question answering tasks. These formats might overlook more implicit forms of bias embedded in generative behavior of longer content. In this work, we investigate gender bias in LLMs using gender stereotypes studied in psychology (e.g., aggressiveness or gossiping) in an open-ended task of narrative generation. We introduce a novel dataset called StereoBias-Stories containing short stories either unconditioned or conditioned on (one, two, or six) random attributes from 25 psychological stereotypes and three task-related story endings. We analyze how the gender contribution in the overall story changes in response to these attributes and present three key findings: (1) While models, on average, are highly biased towards male in unconditioned prompts, conditioning on attributes independent from gender stereotypes mitigates this bias. (2) Combining multiple attributes associated with the same gender stereotype intensifies model behavior, with male ones amplifying bias and female ones alleviating it. (3) Model biases align with psychological ground-truth used for categorization, and alignment strength increases with model size. Together, these insights highlight the importance of psychology-grounded evaluation of LLMs.

Abstract: Estimating the difficulty of exam questions is essential for developing good exams, but professors are not always good at this task. We compare various Large Language Model-based methods with three professors in their ability to estimate what percentage of students will give correct answers on True/False exam questions in the areas of Neural Networks and Machine Learning. Our results show that the professors have limited ability to distinguish between easy and difficult questions and that they are outperformed by directly asking Gemini 2.5 to solve this task. Yet, we obtained even better results using uncertainties of the LLMs solving the questions in a supervised learning setting, using only 42 training samples. We conclude that supervised learning using LLM uncertainty can help professors better estimate the difficulty of exam questions, improving the quality of assessment.

Abstract: Lowering the numerical precision of model parameters and computations is widely adopted to improve the efficiency of retrieval systems. However, when computing relevance scores between the query and documents in low-precision, we observe spurious ties due to the reduced granularity. This introduces high variability in the results based on tie resolution, making the evaluation less reliable. To address this, we propose a more robust retrieval evaluation protocol designed to reduce score variation. It consists of: (1) High-Precision Scoring (HPS), which upcasts the final scoring step to higher precision to resolve tied candidates with minimal computational cost; and (2) Tie-aware Retrieval Metrics (TRM), which report expected scores, range, and bias to quantify order uncertainty of tied candidates. Our experiments test multiple models with three scoring functions on two retrieval datasets to demonstrate that HPS dramatically reduces tie-induced instability, and TRM accurately recovers expected metric values. This combination enables a more consistent and reliable evaluation system for lower-precision retrievals.

Abstract: In recent years, tracking human motion using IMUs from everyday devices such as smartphones and smartwatches has gained increasing popularity. However, due to the sparsity of sensor measurements and the lack of datasets capturing human motion over uneven terrain, existing methods often struggle with pose estimation accuracy and are typically limited to recovering movements on flat terrain only. To this end, we present BaroPoser, the first method that combines IMU and barometric data recorded by a smartphone and a smartwatch to estimate human pose and global translation in real time. By leveraging barometric readings, we estimate sensor height changes, which provide valuable cues for both improving the accuracy of human pose estimation and predicting global translation on non-flat terrain. Furthermore, we propose a local thigh coordinate frame to disentangle local and global motion input for better pose representation learning. We evaluate our method on both public benchmark datasets and real-world recordings. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods that use IMUs only with the same hardware configuration.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) for code optimization have enabled industrial platforms to automate software performance engineering at unprecedented scale and speed. Yet, organizations in regulated industries face strict constraints on which LLMs they can use - many cannot utilize commercial models due to data privacy regulations and compliance requirements, creating a significant challenge for achieving high-quality code optimization while maintaining cost-effectiveness. We address this by implementing a Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) approach that directly synthesizes code from multiple specialized LLMs, comparing it against TurinTech AI's vanilla Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based ensemble system and individual LLM optimizers using real-world industrial codebases. Our key contributions include: (1) First MoA application to industrial code optimization using real-world codebases; (2) Empirical evidence that MoA excels with open-source models, achieving 14.3% to 22.2% cost savings and 28.6% to 32.2% faster optimization times for regulated environments; (3) Deployment guidelines demonstrating GA's advantage with commercial models while both ensembles outperform individual LLMs; and (4) Real-world validation across 50 code snippets and seven LLM combinations, generating over 8,700 variants, addresses gaps in industrial LLM ensemble evaluation. This provides actionable guidance for organizations balancing regulatory compliance with optimization performance in production environments.

Abstract: Large language models with billions of parameters are often over-provisioned: many layers contribute little unique information yet dominate the memory and energy footprint during inference. We present LieQ, a metric-driven post-training quantization framework that addresses the critical challenge of maintaining accuracy in sub-7B models under extreme low-bit compression. Our method introduces three complementary layer-wise diagnostics-Perplexity Drop, Representational Compactness, and Top-k Energy Gain -that reveal a canonical division of labour across layers, enabling automatic bit-width allocation without gradient updates. Unlike existing approaches that suffer severe accuracy degradation at 2-3 bits precision, LieQ achieves state-of-the-art compression-accuracy trade-offs: on Qwen3-4B, it recovers 95.9% of FP16 baseline performance at 2.05-bit quantization, outperforming GPTQ by 19.7% and AWQ by 18.1% on average across seven zero-shot reasoning tasks. Applied to LLaMA3.2-3B, LieQ maintains 98.2% of baseline accuracy at 2.07-bit precision while enabling 4x memory reduction, establishing new paradigms for deploying small language models on resource-constrained edge devices.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a promising research field for enhancing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) without extra training. However, most existing approaches, e.g., Best-of-N and Self-Consistency rely on a single agent interacting with a reward model (SA-SR), constrained by limited capabilities of a single test-time scaling (STTS) paradigm. On the other hand, recent works demonstrate that collective-agent methods can break through the upper bound of single-agent systems by orchestrating diverse models. Thus, in this paper, we take a first step towards exploring Collective Test-Time Scaling (CTTS). Consider the different interaction types of single and multiple models, we design three primary paradigms to investigate the optimal paradigm of CTTS: (1) single agent to multiple reward models (SA-MR); (2) multiple agents to single reward model (MA-SR); and (3) multiple agents to multiple reward models (MA-MR). Extensive experiments demonstrate that MA-MR consistently achieves the best performance. Based on this, we propose a novel framework named CTTS-MM that effectively leverages both multi-agent and multi-reward-model collaboration for enhanced inference. Specifically, for multi-agent collaboration, we propose an Agent Collaboration Search (ACS), which searches for the most effective combination of LLM agents from a large candidate pool; for multi-reward-model collaboration, we propose Mixture of Reword Models (MoR), which consists of a curated question pool and a Prior Reward model Ensemble Selection (PRES) to select the optimal combinations of reward models via Pair-wise Reward Ranking (PRR) metric. Experiments across seven mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CTTS-MM consistently obtains superior performance. Code will be released at https://github.com/magent4aci/CTTS-MM.

Abstract: Existing cybersecurity playbooks are often written in heterogeneous, non-machine-readable formats, which limits their automation and interoperability across Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response platforms. This paper explores the suitability of Large Language Models, combined with Prompt Engineering, to automatically translate legacy incident response playbooks into the standardized, machine-readable CACAO format. We systematically examine various Prompt Engineering techniques and carefully design prompts aimed at maximizing syntactic accuracy and semantic fidelity for control flow preservation. Our modular transformation pipeline integrates a syntax checker to ensure syntactic correctness and features an iterative refinement mechanism that progressively reduces syntactic errors. We evaluate the proposed approach on a custom-generated dataset comprising diverse legacy playbooks paired with manually created CACAO references. The results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the accuracy of playbook transformation over baseline models, effectively captures complex workflow structures, and substantially reduces errors. It highlights the potential for practical deployment in automated cybersecurity playbook transformation tasks.

<title>VLMQ: Efficient Post-Training Quantization for Large Vision-Language Models via Hessian Augmentation</title>

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as an effective approach for compressing large models and accelerating their inference without retraining. While PTQ has been extensively studied in the context of large language models (LLMs), its applicability to vision-language models (VLMs) remains underexplored. In this paper, we identify a modality discrepancy (\emph{i.e.}, limited text tokens \emph{vs.} excessive and redundant vision tokens) of VLMs. However, existing Hessian-based LLM PTQ methods treat all tokens equally during quantization, resulting in severe performance drops when applied to VLMs. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel importance-aware PTQ framework tailored for VLMs, dubbed VLMQ. Specifically, to address vision token redundancy, VLMQ 1) optimizes an importance-aware objective that yields an enhanced Hessian with token-level importance factors, while retaining compatibility with parallelized weight updates, and 2) ensures efficiency and effectiveness by computing these factors via a single lightweight block-wise backward pass, guided by a theoretical connection to token-level perturbations. Extensive evaluations on 8 benchmarks across 0.5B$\sim$32B VLMs demonstrate the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our VLMQ, particularly under low-bit settings. For example, it achieves a substantial \textbf{16.45\%} improvement on MME-RealWorld under 2-bit quantization.

Abstract: As large language models become increasingly integrated into daily life, audio has emerged as a key interface for human-AI interaction. However, this convenience also introduces new vulnerabilities, making audio a potential attack surface for adversaries. Our research introduces WhisperInject, a two-stage adversarial audio attack framework that can manipulate state-of-the-art audio language models to generate harmful content. Our method uses imperceptible perturbations in audio inputs that remain benign to human listeners. The first stage uses a novel reward-based optimization method, Reinforcement Learning with Projected Gradient Descent (RL-PGD), to guide the target model to circumvent its own safety protocols and generate harmful native responses. This native harmful response then serves as the target for Stage 2, Payload Injection, where we use Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) to optimize subtle perturbations that are embedded into benign audio carriers, such as weather queries or greeting messages. Validated under the rigorous StrongREJECT, LlamaGuard, as well as Human Evaluation safety evaluation framework, our experiments demonstrate a success rate exceeding 86% across Qwen2.5-Omni-3B, Qwen2.5-Omni-7B, and Phi-4-Multimodal. Our work demonstrates a new class of practical, audio-native threats, moving beyond theoretical exploits to reveal a feasible and covert method for manipulating AI behavior.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic AI systems in 6G software businesses presents both strategic opportunities and significant challenges. While such systems promise increased autonomy, scalability, and intelligent decision-making across distributed environments, their adoption raises concerns regarding technical immaturity, integration complexity, organizational readiness, and performance-cost trade-offs. In this study, we conducted a preliminary thematic mapping to identify factors influencing the adoption of agentic software within the context of 6G. Drawing on a multivocal literature review and targeted scanning, we identified 29 motivators and 27 demotivators, which were further categorized into five high-level themes in each group. This thematic mapping offers a structured overview of the enabling and inhibiting forces shaping organizational readiness for agentic transformation. Positioned as a feasibility assessment, the study represents an early phase of a broader research initiative aimed at developing and validating a layered maturity model grounded in CMMI model with the software architectural three dimensions possibly Data, Business Logic, and Presentation. Ultimately, this work seeks to provide a practical framework to help software-driven organizations assess, structure, and advance their agent-first capabilities in alignment with the demands of 6G.

<title>SCFlow: Implicitly Learning Style and Content Disentanglement with Flow Models</title>

Abstract: Explicitly disentangling style and content in vision models remains challenging due to their semantic overlap and the subjectivity of human perception. Existing methods propose separation through generative or discriminative objectives, but they still face the inherent ambiguity of disentangling intertwined concepts. Instead, we ask: Can we bypass explicit disentanglement by learning to merge style and content invertibly, allowing separation to emerge naturally? We propose SCFlow, a flow-matching framework that learns bidirectional mappings between entangled and disentangled representations. Our approach is built upon three key insights: 1) Training solely to merge style and content, a well-defined task, enables invertible disentanglement without explicit supervision; 2) flow matching bridges on arbitrary distributions, avoiding the restrictive Gaussian priors of diffusion models and normalizing flows; and 3) a synthetic dataset of 510,000 samples (51 styles $\times$ 10,000 content samples) was curated to simulate disentanglement through systematic style-content pairing. Beyond controllable generation tasks, we demonstrate that SCFlow generalizes to ImageNet-1k and WikiArt in zero-shot settings and achieves competitive performance, highlighting that disentanglement naturally emerges from the invertible merging process.

<title>Visual Document Understanding and Question Answering: A Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework with Test-Time Scaling</title>

Abstract: Existing vision-language models (VLMs), whether generalists or specialists, remain constrained by their parameter scale, lack robust self-correction capabilities, and underperform in tasks involving long visual contexts and complex reasoning, resulting in suboptimal performance on document-based tasks. To address this, we propose MACT, a Multi-Agent Collaboration framework with Test-Time scaling, tailored for visual document understanding and visual question answering (VQA). It comprises four distinct small-scale agents, i.e., planning, execution, judgment, and answer agents, with clearly defined roles and effective collaboration. Notably, the judgment agent exclusively verifies correctness and redirects to prior agents for revisions, outperforming conventional correction strategies. To further expand the capability boundaries of the framework, we propose mixed reward modeling that balances agent-specific abilities and global collaboration, as well as agent-wise hybrid test-time scaling, which customizes different scaling strategies for each agent based on their functions. Evaluated on benchmarks spanning both document-based and non-document-based settings, our MACT shows superior performance with a smaller parameter scale without sacrificing the ability of general and mathematical tasks. Especially, it stands out in benchmarks involving long visual contexts and complicated reasoning. The three variants of MACT consistently hold the top three positions in average scores, leading in 13 of the 15 benchmarks. Code will be available at: https://github.com/YU-deep/MACT.git.

<title>SlotMatch: Distilling Temporally Consistent Object-Centric Representations for Unsupervised Video Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Unsupervised video segmentation is a challenging computer vision task, especially due to the lack of supervisory signals coupled with the complexity of visual scenes. To overcome this challenge, state-of-the-art models based on slot attention often have to rely on large and computationally expensive neural architectures. To this end, we propose a simple knowledge distillation framework that effectively transfers object-centric representations to a lightweight student. The proposed framework, called SlotMatch, aligns corresponding teacher and student slots via the cosine similarity, requiring no additional distillation objectives or auxiliary supervision. The simplicity of SlotMatch is confirmed via theoretical and empirical evidence, both indicating that integrating additional losses is redundant. We conduct experiments on two datasets to compare the state-of-the-art teacher model, SlotContrast, with our distilled student. The results show that our student based on SlotMatch matches and even outperforms its teacher, while using 3.6x less parameters and running 1.9x faster. Moreover, our student surpasses previous unsupervised video segmentation models.

Abstract: This paper presents Fd-CycleGAN, an image-to-image (I2I) translation framework that enhances latent representation learning to approximate real data distributions. Building upon the foundation of CycleGAN, our approach integrates Local Neighborhood Encoding (LNE) and frequency-aware supervision to capture fine-grained local pixel semantics while preserving structural coherence from the source domain. We employ distribution-based loss metrics, including KL/JS divergence and log-based similarity measures, to explicitly quantify the alignment between real and generated image distributions in both spatial and frequency domains. To validate the efficacy of Fd-CycleGAN, we conduct experiments on diverse datasets -- Horse2Zebra, Monet2Photo, and a synthetically augmented Strike-off dataset. Compared to baseline CycleGAN and other state-of-the-art methods, our approach demonstrates superior perceptual quality, faster convergence, and improved mode diversity, particularly in low-data regimes. By effectively capturing local and global distribution characteristics, Fd-CycleGAN achieves more visually coherent and semantically consistent translations. Our results suggest that frequency-guided latent learning significantly improves generalization in image translation tasks, with promising applications in document restoration, artistic style transfer, and medical image synthesis. We also provide comparative insights with diffusion-based generative models, highlighting the advantages of our lightweight adversarial approach in terms of training efficiency and qualitative output.

Abstract: X-ray medical report generation is one of the important applications of artificial intelligence in healthcare. With the support of large foundation models, the quality of medical report generation has significantly improved. However, challenges such as hallucination and weak disease diagnostic capability still persist. In this paper, we first construct a large-scale multi-modal medical knowledge graph (termed M3KG) based on the ground truth medical report using the GPT-4o. It contains 2477 entities, 3 kinds of relations, 37424 triples, and 6943 disease-aware vision tokens for the CheXpert Plus dataset. Then, we sample it to obtain multi-granularity semantic graphs and use an R-GCN encoder for feature extraction. For the input X-ray image, we adopt the Swin-Transformer to extract the vision features and interact with the knowledge using cross-attention. The vision tokens are fed into a Q-former and retrieved the disease-aware vision tokens using another cross-attention. Finally, we adopt the large language model to map the semantic knowledge graph, input X-ray image, and disease-aware vision tokens into language descriptions. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed knowledge graph and X-ray report generation framework. The source code of this paper will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Medical_Image_Analysis.

Abstract: Predicting the social and behavioral impact of future technologies, before they are achieved, would allow us to guide their development and regulation before these impacts get entrenched. Traditionally, this prediction has relied on qualitative, narrative methods. Here we describe a method which uses experimental methods to simulate future technologies, and collect quantitative measures of the attitudes and behaviors of participants assigned to controlled variations of the future. We call this method 'science fiction science'. We suggest that the reason why this method has not been fully embraced yet, despite its potential benefits, is that experimental scientists may be reluctant to engage in work facing such serious validity threats as science fiction science. To address these threats, we consider possible constraints on the kind of technology that science fiction science may study, as well as the unconventional, immersive methods that science fiction science may require. We seek to provide perspective on the reasons why this method has been marginalized for so long, what benefits it would bring if it could be built on strong yet unusual methods, and how we can normalize these methods to help the diverse community of science fiction scientists to engage in a virtuous cycle of validity improvement.

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification faces significant challenges due to data distribution shifts caused by heterogeneous electrode configurations, acquisition protocols, and hardware discrepancies across domains. This paper introduces IMAC, a novel channel-dependent mask and imputation self-supervised framework that formulates the alignment of cross-domain EEG data shifts as a spatial time series imputation task. To address heterogeneous electrode configurations in cross-domain scenarios, IMAC first standardizes different electrode layouts using a 3D-to-2D positional unification mapping strategy, establishing unified spatial representations. Unlike previous mask-based self-supervised representation learning methods, IMAC introduces spatio-temporal signal alignment. This involves constructing a channel-dependent mask and reconstruction task framed as a low-to-high resolution EEG spatial imputation problem. Consequently, this approach simulates cross-domain variations such as channel omissions and temporal instabilities, thus enabling the model to leverage the proposed imputer for robust signal alignment during inference. Furthermore, IMAC incorporates a disentangled structure that separately models the temporal and spatial information of the EEG signals separately, reducing computational complexity while enhancing flexibility and adaptability. Comprehensive evaluations across 10 publicly available EEG datasets demonstrate IMAC's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy in both cross-subject and cross-center validation scenarios. Notably, IMAC shows strong robustness under both simulated and real-world distribution shifts, surpassing baseline methods by up to $35$\% in integrity scores while maintaining consistent classification accuracy.

Abstract: Human cognition naturally engages with abstract and fluid concepts, whereas existing reasoning models often rely on generating discrete tokens, potentially constraining their expressive capabilities. Recent advancements aim to address this limitation by enabling large language models (LLMs) to generate soft, abstract tokens, thus facilitating reasoning within a continuous concept space. This paper explores the `Soft Thinking' capabilities of various LLMs by examining the models' internal behavior using a suite of probing techniques. Contrary to the common belief that Soft Thinking enables the simultaneous exploration of diverse reasoning paths, our findings reveal that LLMs predominantly rely on the most influential component of the soft inputs during subsequent decoding steps. This reliance hinders the exploration of different reasoning paths and reduces vanilla Soft Thinking to a form of greedy decoding, obscuring the advantage of transmitting more information through Soft Tokens. To tackle this issue, we explore sampling strategies to introduce \emph{randomness}, employing methods such as Dirichlet resampling and the Gumbel-Softmax trick. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating randomness can alleviate the limitations of vanilla approaches and unleash the potential of Soft Thinking. Notably, the Gumbel-Softmax trick provides adequate randomness with controlled smoothness, resulting in superior performance across eight reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Music recordings often suffer from audio quality issues such as excessive reverberation, distortion, clipping, tonal imbalances, and a narrowed stereo image, especially when created in non-professional settings without specialized equipment or expertise. These problems are typically corrected using separate specialized tools and manual adjustments. In this paper, we introduce SonicMaster, the first unified generative model for music restoration and mastering that addresses a broad spectrum of audio artifacts with text-based control. SonicMaster is conditioned on natural language instructions to apply targeted enhancements, or can operate in an automatic mode for general restoration. To train this model, we construct the SonicMaster dataset, a large dataset of paired degraded and high-quality tracks by simulating common degradation types with nineteen degradation functions belonging to five enhancements groups: equalization, dynamics, reverb, amplitude, and stereo. Our approach leverages a flow-matching generative training paradigm to learn an audio transformation that maps degraded inputs to their cleaned, mastered versions guided by text prompts. Objective audio quality metrics demonstrate that SonicMaster significantly improves sound quality across all artifact categories. Furthermore, subjective listening tests confirm that listeners prefer SonicMaster's enhanced outputs over the original degraded audio, highlighting the effectiveness of our unified approach.

Abstract: With the rapid development of generative technology, current generative models can generate high-fidelity digital content and edit it in a controlled manner. However, there is a risk that malicious individuals might misuse these capabilities for misleading activities. Although existing research has attempted to shield photographic images from being manipulated by generative models, there remains a significant disparity in the protection offered to video content editing. To bridge the gap, we propose a protection method named VideoGuard, which can effectively protect videos from unauthorized malicious editing. This protection is achieved through the subtle introduction of nearly unnoticeable perturbations that interfere with the functioning of the intended generative diffusion models. Due to the redundancy between video frames, and inter-frame attention mechanism in video diffusion models, simply applying image-based protection methods separately to every video frame can not shield video from unauthorized editing. To tackle the above challenge, we adopt joint frame optimization, treating all video frames as an optimization entity. Furthermore, we extract video motion information and fuse it into optimization objectives. Thus, these alterations can effectively force the models to produce outputs that are implausible and inconsistent. We provide a pipeline to optimize this perturbation. Finally, we use both objective metrics and subjective metrics to demonstrate the efficacy of our method, and the results show that the protection performance of VideoGuard is superior to all the baseline methods.

Abstract: Personalized generation in T2I diffusion models aims to naturally incorporate individual user preferences into the generation process with minimal user intervention. However, existing studies primarily rely on prompt-level modeling with large-scale models, often leading to inaccurate personalization due to the limited input token capacity of T2I diffusion models. To address these limitations, we propose DrUM, a novel method that integrates user profiling with a transformer-based adapter to enable personalized generation through condition-level modeling in the latent space. DrUM demonstrates strong performance on large-scale datasets and seamlessly integrates with open-source text encoders, making it compatible with widely used foundation T2I models without requiring additional fine-tuning.

Abstract: While prior research on text-to-image generation has predominantly focused on biases in human depictions, we investigate a more subtle yet pervasive phenomenon: demographic bias in generated objects (e.g., cars). We introduce SODA (Stereotyped Object Diagnostic Audit), a novel framework for systematically measuring such biases. Our approach compares visual attributes of objects generated with demographic cues (e.g., "for young people'') to those from neutral prompts, across 2,700 images produced by three state-of-the-art models (GPT Image-1, Imagen 4, and Stable Diffusion) in five object categories. Through a comprehensive analysis, we uncover strong associations between specific demographic groups and visual attributes, such as recurring color patterns prompted by gender or ethnicity cues. These patterns reflect and reinforce not only well-known stereotypes but also more subtle and unintuitive biases. We also observe that some models generate less diverse outputs, which in turn amplifies the visual disparities compared to neutral prompts. Our proposed auditing framework offers a practical approach for testing, revealing how stereotypes still remain embedded in today's generative models. We see this as an essential step toward more systematic and responsible AI development.

Abstract: As enterprise codebases continue to grow in scale and complexity, the volume of lint errors far exceeds engineers' manual remediation capacity, leading to continuous accumulation of technical debt and hindered development efficiency. This paper presents BitsAI-Fix, an automated lint error remediation workflow based on Large Language Models (LLMs), designed to address this critical challenge in industrial-scale environments. BitsAI-Fix employs tree-sitter for context expansion and generates search-and-replace format patches through specially trained LLMs, followed by lint scan re-verification to output final remediation results. Additionally, our approach introduces an innovative progressive reinforcement learning (RL) training strategy that can automatically acquire verifiable training data during the project cold-start phase and continuously iterate the model by collecting online samples through feedback after system deployment. Furthermore, we designed a targeted rule-based reward mechanism that combines format rewards and correctness rewards while penalizing redundant modifications. We also propose a "code diff matching" methodology to continuously track online effectiveness. In production deployment at ByteDance, our solution has supported over 5,000 engineers, resolved more than 12,000 static analysis issues, achieved approximately 85% remediation accuracy, with around 1,000 weekly active adopters. This work demonstrates the practical feasibility of LLM-based code remediation solutions in enterprise environments and serves as a reference for automated code fix in large-scale industrial scenarios.

The lack of standardization and the variability in reporting formats further exacerbate the difficulty of extracting and interpreting relevant information from large volumes of documents. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of answering questions related to carbon footprints within sustainability reports available in PDF format. Unlike previous approaches, our focus is on addressing the difficulties posed by the unstructured and inconsistent nature of text extracted from PDF parsing. To facilitate this analysis, we introduce CarbonPDF-QA, an open-source dataset containing question-answer pairs for 1735 product report documents, along with human-annotated answers. Our analysis shows that GPT-4o struggles to answer questions with data inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we propose CarbonPDF, an LLM-based technique specifically designed to answer carbon footprint questions on such datasets. We develop CarbonPDF by fine-tuning Llama 3 with our training data. Our results show that our technique outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques, including question-answering (QA) systems finetuned on table and text data.

<title>MoKA: Mixture of Kronecker Adapters</title>

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is essential for reducing the computational overhead of large language models (LLMs). Low-rank family adapters are commonly used to control the parameter size efficiently while maintaining the generative power of LLMs. However, their limited expressiveness due to the rank constraint often restricts their performance on complex tasks. We propose Mixture of Kronecker Adapters (MoKA), a new generation of Kronecker adapters that addresses this limitation by modeling weight updates as a mixture of Kronecker products. Our proposed adapter leverages a gating mechanism that measures the importance of each Kronecker factor, enabling more expressive adaptation. Moreover, MoKA enables a rank flexibility that provides a better trade-off between parameter efficiency and accuracy. To ensure hardware efficiency, we reformulate Kronecker computations using standard matrix operations, allowing seamless deployment on GPU-optimized hardware. We conduct extensive experiments on instruction-tuning and commonsense reasoning tasks using low-bit quantized versions of LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA3-8B models. MoKA not only outperforms PEFT baselines, but also reduces the number of trainable parameters up to 27x, achieving state-of-the-art trade-offs between performance and parameter efficiency.

Abstract: Retinal microvascular imaging is increasingly recognised as a non invasive method for evaluating systemic vascular and metabolic health. However, the association between lipidomics and retinal vasculature remains inadequate. This study investigates the relationships between serum lipid subclasses, free fatty acids (FA), diacylglycerols (DAG), triacylglycerols (TAG), and cholesteryl esters (CE), and retinal microvascular characteristics in a large population-based cohort. Using Spearman correlation analysis, we examined the interconnection between lipid subclasses and ten retinal microvascular traits, applying the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (BH-FDR) to adjust for statistical significance.
  Results indicated that FA were linked to retinal vessel twistiness, while CE correlated with the average widths of arteries and veins. Conversely, DAG and TAG showed negative correlations with the width and complexity of arterioles and venules. These findings suggest that retinal vascular architecture reflects distinct circulating lipid profiles, supporting its role as a non-invasive marker of systemic metabolic health. This study is the first to integrate deep learning (DL)derived retinal traits with lipidomic subclasses in a healthy cohort, thereby providing insights into microvascular structural changes independent of disease status or treatment effects.

<title>EmoSteer-TTS: Fine-Grained and Training-Free Emotion-Controllable Text-to-Speech via Activation Steering</title>

Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) has shown great progress in recent years. However, most existing TTS systems offer only coarse and rigid emotion control, typically via discrete emotion labels or a carefully crafted and detailed emotional text prompt, making fine-grained emotion manipulation either inaccessible or unstable. These models also require extensive, high-quality datasets for training. To address these limitations, we propose EmoSteer-TTS, a novel training-free approach, to achieve fine-grained speech emotion control (conversion, interpolation, erasure) by activation steering. We first empirically observe that modifying a subset of the internal activations within a flow matching-based TTS model can effectively alter the emotional tone of synthesized speech. Building on this insight, we then develop a training-free and efficient algorithm, including activation extraction, emotional token searching, and inference-time steering, which can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of pretrained models (e.g., F5-TTS, CosyVoice2, and E2-TTS). In addition, to derive effective steering vectors, we construct a curated emotional speech dataset with diverse speakers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EmoSteer-TTS enables fine-grained, interpretable, and continuous control over speech emotion, outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method that achieves training-free and continuous fine-grained emotion control in TTS.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of dimension reduction, tailored to improving time series forecasting with high-dimensional predictors. We propose a novel Supervised Deep Dynamic Principal component analysis (SDDP) framework that incorporates the target variable and lagged observations into the factor extraction process. Assisted by a temporal neural network, we construct target-aware predictors by scaling the original predictors in a supervised manner, with larger weights assigned to predictors with stronger forecasting power. A principal component analysis is then performed on the target-aware predictors to extract the estimated SDDP factors. This supervised factor extraction not only improves predictive accuracy in the downstream forecasting task but also yields more interpretable and target-specific latent factors. Building upon SDDP, we propose a factor-augmented nonlinear dynamic forecasting model that unifies a broad family of factor-model-based forecasting approaches. To further demonstrate the broader applicability of SDDP, we extend our studies to a more challenging scenario when the predictors are only partially observable. We validate the empirical performance of the proposed method on several real-world public datasets. The results show that our algorithm achieves notable improvements in forecasting accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Smart agriculture applications, integrating technologies like the Internet of Things and machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) into agriculture, hold promise to address modern challenges of rising food demand, environmental pollution, and water scarcity. Alongside the concept of the phytobiome, which defines the area including the plant, its environment, and associated organisms, and the recent emergence of molecular communication (MC), there exists an important opportunity to advance agricultural science and practice using communication theory. In this article, we motivate to use the communication engineering perspective for developing a holistic understanding of the phytobiome communication and bridge the gap between the phytobiome communication and smart agriculture. Firstly, an overview of phytobiome communication via molecular and electrophysiological signals is presented and a multi-scale framework modeling the phytobiome as a communication network is conceptualized. Then, how this framework is used to model electrophysiological signals is demonstrated with plant experiments. Furthermore, possible smart agriculture applications, such as smart irrigation and targeted delivery of agrochemicals, through engineering the phytobiome communication are proposed. These applications merge ML/AI methods with the Internet of Bio-Nano-Things enabled by MC and pave the way towards more efficient, sustainable, and eco-friendly agricultural production. Finally, the implementation challenges, open research issues, and industrial outlook for these applications are discussed.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) builds trust in complex systems through model attribution methods that reveal the decision rationale. However, due to the absence of a unified optimal explanation, existing XAI methods lack a ground truth for objective evaluation and optimization. To address this issue, we propose Deep architecture-based Faith explainer (DeepFaith), a domain-free and model-agnostic unified explanation framework under the lens of faithfulness. By establishing a unified formulation for multiple widely used and well-validated faithfulness metrics, we derive an optimal explanation objective whose solution simultaneously achieves optimal faithfulness across these metrics, thereby providing a ground truth from a theoretical perspective. We design an explainer learning framework that leverages multiple existing explanation methods, applies deduplicating and filtering to construct high-quality supervised explanation signals, and optimizes both pattern consistency loss and local correlation to train a faithful explainer. Once trained, DeepFaith can generate highly faithful explanations through a single forward pass without accessing the model being explained. On 12 diverse explanation tasks spanning 6 models and 6 datasets, DeepFaith achieves the highest overall faithfulness across 10 metrics compared to all baseline methods, highlighting its effectiveness and cross-domain generalizability.

Abstract: Miniaturized endoscopy has advanced accurate visual perception within the human body. Prevailing research remains limited to conventional cameras employing convex lenses, where the physical constraints with millimetre-scale thickness impose serious impediments on the micro-level clinical. Recently, with the emergence of meta-optics, ultra-micro imaging based on metalenses (micron-scale) has garnered great attention, serving as a promising solution. However, due to the physical difference of metalens, there is a large gap in data acquisition and algorithm research. In light of this, we aim to bridge this unexplored gap, advancing the novel metalens endoscopy. First, we establish datasets for metalens endoscopy and conduct preliminary optical simulation, identifying two derived optical issues that physically adhere to strong optical priors. Second, we propose MetaScope, a novel optics-driven neural network tailored for metalens endoscopy driven by physical optics. MetaScope comprises two novel designs: Optics-informed Intensity Adjustment (OIA), rectifying intensity decay by learning optical embeddings, and Optics-informed Chromatic Correction (OCC), mitigating chromatic aberration by learning spatial deformations informed by learned Point Spread Function (PSF) distributions. To enhance joint learning, we further deploy a gradient-guided distillation to transfer knowledge from the foundational model adaptively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaScope not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both metalens segmentation and restoration but also achieves impressive generalized ability in real biomedical scenes.

Abstract: This paper presents Block, a distributed scheduling framework designed to optimize load balancing and auto-provisioning across instances in large language model serving frameworks by leveraging contextual information from incoming requests. Unlike popular model serving systems that rely on monolithic and heuristic task schedulers, Block operates as a fully distributed, stateless, and predictive scheduling system to achieve low overhead, reliability, and scalability. It leverages the deterministic and predictable characteristics of LLM inferences, such as host configurations, response lengths, and hardware performance, to make scheduling decisions based on accurately predicted metrics. Evaluation on a 12 GPUs cluster shows that Block significantly outperforms heuristic schedulers, boosting serving capacity by up to 16.7\% and reducing P99 tail latency by up to 49.5\%. These performance gains remain consistent across diverse models, workloads and configurations. Code and data are open-sourced.

Abstract: We introduce Goedel-Prover-V2, a series of open-source language models that set a new state-of-the-art in automated theorem proving. Built on the standard expert iteration and reinforcement learning pipeline, our approach incorporates three key innovations: (1) Scaffolded data synthesis: We generate synthetic tasks of increasing difficulty to train the model to master increasingly complex theorems; (2) Verifier-guided self-correction: We enable the model to iteratively revise its proofs by leveraging feedback from the Lean compiler; (3) Model averaging: We merge model checkpoints to mitigate the decrease in model output diversity in later stages of training. Our small model, Goedel-Prover-V2-8B, reaches 84.6% pass@32 on MiniF2F and outperforms DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B under the same metric, despite being 80X smaller. Our flagship model, Goedel-Prover-V2-32B, achieves 88.1% on MiniF2F at pass@32 in standard mode and 90.4% in self-correction mode, outperforming prior SOTA by a large margin. Additionally, our flagship model solves 86 problems on PutnamBench at pass@184, securing the first place among open-source models on the leaderboard, surpassing DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B's record of solving 47 problems by pass@1024 with a significantly smaller model size and compute budget. At the time of its release (July-August 2025), Goedel-Prover-V2 achieves the strongest overall performance among all open-source theorem provers. It also ranks among the top-performing models--including closed-source systems with publicly reported performance--under a constrained test-time compute budget. Our models, code, and data are released at https://github.com/Goedel-LM/Goedel-Prover-V2.

Abstract: We present Attention Zoom, a modular and model-agnostic spatial attention mechanism designed to improve feature extraction in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Unlike traditional attention approaches that require architecture-specific integration, our method introduces a standalone layer that spatially emphasizes high-importance regions in the input. We evaluated Attention Zoom on multiple CNN backbones using CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet, showing consistent improvements in Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy. Visual analyses using Grad-CAM and spatial warping reveal that our method encourages fine-grained and diverse attention patterns. Our results confirm the effectiveness and generality of the proposed layer for improving CCNs with minimal architectural overhead.

Abstract: Sellers at eBay are recommended keyphrases to bid on to enhance the performance of their advertising campaigns. The relevance of these keyphrases is crucial in avoiding the overcrowding of search systems with irrelevant items and maintaining a positive seller perception. It is essential that keyphrase recommendations align with both seller and Search judgments regarding auctions. Due to the difficulty in procuring negative human judgment at scale, employing LLM-as-a-judge to mimic seller judgment has been established as the norm in several studies. This study introduces a novel two-step LLM distillation process from a LLM-judge used to debias our Embedding Based Retrieval (EBR) model from the various biases that exist in click-data. We distill from an LLM teacher via a cross-encoder assistant into a bi-encoder student using a multi-task training approach, ultimately employing the student bi-encoder to retrieve relevant advertiser keyphrases. We show that integrating a knowledge distillation process from LLMs in a multi-task training setup enhances bi-encoder performance in retrieving relevant advertiser keyphrases at eBay.

Abstract: The internal representations learned by deep networks are often sensitive to architecture-specific choices, raising questions about the stability, alignment, and transferability of learned structure across models. In this paper, we investigate how structural constraints--such as linear shaping operators and corrective paths--affect the compatibility of internal representations across different architectures. Building on the insights from prior studies on structured transformations and convergence, we develop a framework for measuring and analyzing representational alignment across networks with distinct but related architectural priors. Through a combination of theoretical insights, empirical probes, and controlled transfer experiments, we demonstrate that structural regularities induce representational geometry that is more stable under architectural variation. This suggests that certain forms of inductive bias not only support generalization within a model, but also improve the interoperability of learned features across models. We conclude with a discussion on the implications of representational transferability for model distillation, modular learning, and the principled design of robust learning systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large multimodal models have provided blind or visually impaired (BVI) individuals with new capabilities to interpret and engage with the real world through interactive systems that utilize live video feeds. However, the potential benefits and challenges of such capabilities to support diverse real-world assistive tasks remain unclear. In this paper, we present findings from an exploratory study with eight BVI participants. Participants used ChatGPT's Advanced Voice with Video, a state-of-the-art live video AI released in late 2024, in various real-world scenarios, from locating objects to recognizing visual landmarks, across unfamiliar indoor and outdoor environments. Our findings indicate that current live video AI effectively provides guidance and answers for static visual scenes but falls short in delivering essential live descriptions required in dynamic situations. Despite inaccuracies in spatial and distance information, participants leveraged the provided visual information to supplement their mobility strategies. Although the system was perceived as human-like due to high-quality voice interactions, assumptions about users' visual abilities, hallucinations, generic responses, and a tendency towards sycophancy led to confusion, distrust, and potential risks for BVI users. Based on the results, we discuss implications for assistive video AI agents, including incorporating additional sensing capabilities for real-world use, determining appropriate intervention timing beyond turn-taking interactions, and addressing ecological and safety concerns.

<title>Forest vs Tree: The $(N, K)$ Trade-off in Reproducible ML Evaluation</title>

Abstract: Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific validation and of the authority it confers on its results. Reproducibility in machine learning evaluations leads to greater trust, confidence, and value. However, the ground truth responses used in machine learning often necessarily come from humans, among whom disagreement is prevalent, and surprisingly little research has studied the impact of effectively ignoring disagreement in these responses, as is typically the case. One reason for the lack of research is that budgets for collecting human-annotated evaluation data are limited, and obtaining more samples from multiple annotators for each example greatly increases the per-item annotation costs. We investigate the trade-off between the number of items ($N$) and the number of responses per item ($K$) needed for reliable machine learning evaluation. We analyze a diverse collection of categorical datasets for which multiple annotations per item exist, and simulated distributions fit to these datasets, to determine the optimal $(N, K)$ configuration, given a fixed budget ($N \times K$), for collecting evaluation data and reliably comparing the performance of machine learning models. Our findings show, first, that accounting for human disagreement may come with $N \times K$ at no more than 1000 (and often much lower) for every dataset tested on at least one metric. Moreover, this minimal $N \times K$ almost always occurred for $K > 10$. Furthermore, the nature of the tradeoff between $K$ and $N$ -- or if one even existed -- depends on the evaluation metric, with metrics that are more sensitive to the full distribution of responses performing better at higher levels of $K$. Our methods can be used to help ML practitioners get more effective test data by finding the optimal metrics and number of items and annotations per item to collect to get the most reliability for their budget.

Abstract: Generative models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), produce fluent outputs yet lack verifiable guarantees. We adapt Design by Contract (DbC) and type-theoretic principles to introduce a contract layer that mediates every LLM call. Contracts stipulate semantic and type requirements on inputs and outputs, coupled with probabilistic remediation to steer generation toward compliance. The layer exposes the dual view of LLMs as semantic parsers and probabilistic black-box components. Contract satisfaction is probabilistic and semantic validation is operationally defined through programmer-specified conditions on well-typed data structures. More broadly, this work postulates that any two agents satisfying the same contracts are \emph{functionally equivalent} with respect to those contracts.

Abstract: In the discourse on AI regulation, 'responsible AI' is the dominant paradigm, with the focus on mitigating the risks related to AI systems. While this focus is important and necessary, it has limited use for a systematic consideration of AI's societal impact. This paper proposes a proto-framework for assessing the societal impact of AI systems by operationalising the concept of freedom. This proto-framework is intended as a step towards a fully operationalised framework to be used in policymaking contexts. By drawing on Kantian philosophy and related contemporary interpretations, freedom is developed as the counterpart to the concept of responsibility. Two dimensions of freedom are developed in further detail: freedom as capability and freedom as opportunity. These two dimensions of freedom are then applied in a proto-framework that systematically considers AI's impact on society using the Sustainable Development Goals. This proto-framework aims to complement current risk-based approaches and thereby offers a first step towards operationalising the concept of freedom in AI regulation.

Abstract: As AI systems become integral to knowledge-intensive work, questions arise not only about their functionality but also their epistemic roles in human-AI interaction. While HCI research has proposed various AI role typologies, it often overlooks how AI reshapes users' roles as knowledge contributors. This study examines how users form epistemic relationships with AI-how they assess, trust, and collaborate with it in research and teaching contexts. Based on 31 interviews with academics across disciplines, we developed a five-part codebook and identified five relationship types: Instrumental Reliance, Contingent Delegation, Co-agency Collaboration, Authority Displacement, and Epistemic Abstention. These reflect variations in trust, assessment modes, tasks, and human epistemic status. Our findings show that epistemic roles are dynamic and context-dependent. We argue for shifting beyond static metaphors of AI toward a more nuanced framework that captures how humans and AI co-construct knowledge, enriching HCI's understanding of the relational and normative dimensions of AI use.

Abstract: Can large language models improve without external data -- by generating their own questions and answers? We hypothesize that a pre-trained language model can improve its reasoning skills given only a single prompt specifying the topic (e.g., algebra word problems) and asking the model to generate its own questions. To do this, we propose Self-Questioning Language Models (SQLM): an asymmetric self-play framework where a proposer is given the topic and generates a question for a solver, who tries to answer it. Both the proposer and solver are trained via reinforcement learning. The proposer receives a reward if the problem is not too easy or too difficult, and the solver receives a reward based on majority voting, a proxy for correctness in the absence of ground-truth answers. For coding, the proposer can instead generate unit tests which are used for verification. We study this asymmetric self-play framework on three benchmarks: three-digit multiplication, algebra problems from the OMEGA benchmark, and programming problems from Codeforces. By continually generating more interesting problems and attempting to solve them, language models can improve on downstream benchmarks without access to any curated training datasets.

Abstract: Answer verification is crucial not only for evaluating large language models (LLMs) by matching their unstructured outputs against standard answers, but also serves as the reward model to guide LLM optimization. Most evaluation frameworks rely on regularized matching or employ general LLMs for answer verification, which demands extensive, repetitive customization for regex rules or evaluation prompts. Two fundamental limitations persist in current methodologies: 1) the absence of comprehensive benchmarks that systematically evaluate verification capabilities across different LLMs; and 2) the nascent stage of verifier development, where existing approaches lack both the robustness to handle complex edge cases and the generalizability across different domains. In this work, we develop CompassVerifier, an accurate and robust lightweight verifier model for evaluation and outcome reward. It demonstrates multi-domain competency spanning math, knowledge, and diverse reasoning tasks, with the capability to process various answer types, including multi-subproblems, formulas, and sequence answers, while effectively identifying abnormal/invalid responses. We introduce VerifierBench benchmark comprising model outputs collected from multiple data sources, augmented through manual analysis of metaerror patterns to enhance CompassVerifier.

Abstract: Computational models of purposeful behavior comprise both descriptive and prescriptive aspects, used respectively to ascertain and evaluate situations in the world. In reinforcement learning, prescriptive reward functions are assumed to depend on predefined and fixed descriptive state representations. Alternatively, these two aspects may emerge interdependently: goals can shape the acquired state representations and vice versa. Here, we present a computational framework for state representation learning in bounded agents, where descriptive and prescriptive aspects are coupled through the notion of goal-directed, or telic, states. We introduce the concept of telic-controllability to characterize the tradeoff between the granularity of a telic state representation and the policy complexity required to reach all telic states. We propose an algorithm for learning telic-controllable state representations, illustrating it using a simulated navigation task. Our framework highlights the role of deliberate ignorance -- knowing what to ignore -- for learning state representations that balance goal flexibility and cognitive complexity.

<title>BrainECHO: Semantic Brain Signal Decoding through Vector-Quantized Spectrogram Reconstruction for Whisper-Enhanced Text Generation</title>

Abstract: Current EEG/MEG-to-text decoding systems suffer from three key limitations: (1) reliance on teacher-forcing methods, which compromises robustness during inference, (2) sensitivity to session-specific noise, hindering generalization across subjects, and (3) misalignment between brain signals and linguistic representations due to pre-trained language model over-dominance. To overcome these challenges, we propose BrainECHO (Brain signal decoding via vEctor-quantized speCtrogram reconstruction for WHisper-enhanced text generatiOn), a multi-stage framework that employs decoupled representation learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both EEG and MEG datasets. Specifically, BrainECHO consists of three stages: (1) Discrete autoencoding, which transforms continuous Mel spectrograms into a finite set of high-quality discrete representations for subsequent stages. (2) Frozen alignment, where brain signal embeddings are mapped to corresponding Mel spectrogram embeddings in a frozen latent space, effectively filtering session-specific noise through vector-quantized reconstruction, yielding a 3.65% improvement in BLEU-4 score. (3) Constrained decoding fine-tuning, which leverages the pre-trained Whisper model for audio-to-text translation, balancing signal adaptation with knowledge preservation, and achieving 74%-89% decoding BLEU scores without excessive reliance on teacher forcing. BrainECHO demonstrates robustness across sentence, session, and subject-independent conditions, passing Gaussian noise tests and showcasing its potential for enhancing language-based brain-computer interfaces.

Abstract: Game theory is a foundational framework for analyzing strategic interactions, and its intersection with large language models (LLMs) is a rapidly growing field. However, existing surveys mainly focus narrowly on using game theory to evaluate LLM behavior. This paper provides the first comprehensive survey of the bidirectional relationship between Game Theory and LLMs. We propose a novel taxonomy that categorizes the research in this intersection into four distinct perspectives: (1) evaluating LLMs in game-based scenarios; (2) improving LLMs using game-theoretic concepts for better interpretability and alignment; (3) modeling the competitive landscape of LLM development and its societal impact; and (4) leveraging LLMs to advance game models and to solve corresponding game theory problems. Furthermore, we identify key challenges and outline future research directions. By systematically investigating this interdisciplinary landscape, our survey highlights the mutual influence of game theory and LLMs, fostering progress at the intersection of these fields.

Abstract: This benchmark suite provides a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing both individual LLMs and multi-agent systems in Real-world planning and scheduling scenarios. The suite encompasses 14 designed planning and scheduling problems that progress from basic to highly complex, incorporating key aspects such as multi-agent coordination, inter-agent dependencies, and dynamic environmental disruptions. Each problem can be scaled along three dimensions: the number of parallel planning threads, the complexity of inter-dependencies, and the frequency of unexpected disruptions requiring Real-time adaptation. The benchmark includes 14 detailed problem specifications, 15 comparison methods including Random, LPT, SPT, STPT, MPSR, DRL-Liu, GP, GEP, LSO, SPT/TWKR, DRL-Chen, DRL-Zhang, 2+ evaluation metrics, and baseline implementations using 3+ LLMs including GPT-4o, Claude-3.7, DeepSeek-R1, and 4 contemporary frameworks including LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI, and Swarm, enabling rigorous testing of both single-agent and multi-agent planning capabilities. Through standardized evaluation criteria and scalable complexity, this benchmark aims to be opened to public, and drive progress in developing more adaptable, robust, and scalable AI planning systems for Real-world applications.

Abstract: With the advancement of web techniques, they have significantly revolutionized various aspects of people's lives. Despite the importance of the web, many tasks performed on it are repetitive and time-consuming, negatively impacting overall quality of life. To efficiently handle these tedious daily tasks, one of the most promising approaches is to advance autonomous agents based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, referred to as AI Agents, as they can operate continuously without fatigue or performance degradation. In the context of the web, leveraging AI Agents -- termed WebAgents -- to automatically assist people in handling tedious daily tasks can dramatically enhance productivity and efficiency. Recently, Large Foundation Models (LFMs) containing billions of parameters have exhibited human-like language understanding and reasoning capabilities, showing proficiency in performing various complex tasks. This naturally raises the question: `Can LFMs be utilized to develop powerful AI Agents that automatically handle web tasks, providing significant convenience to users?' To fully explore the potential of LFMs, extensive research has emerged on WebAgents designed to complete daily web tasks according to user instructions, significantly enhancing the convenience of daily human life. In this survey, we comprehensively review existing research studies on WebAgents across three key aspects: architectures, training, and trustworthiness. Additionally, several promising directions for future research are explored to provide deeper insights.

Abstract: Reward shaping in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for complex tasks remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches often fail to find optimal solutions or cannot efficiently handle such tasks. We propose HYPRL, a specification-guided reinforcement learning framework that learns control policies w.r.t. hyperproperties expressed in HyperLTL. Hyperproperties constitute a powerful formalism for specifying objectives and constraints over sets of execution traces across agents. To learn policies that maximize the satisfaction of a HyperLTL formula $\phi$, we apply Skolemization to manage quantifier alternations and define quantitative robustness functions to shape rewards over execution traces of a Markov decision process with unknown transitions. A suitable RL algorithm is then used to learn policies that collectively maximize the expected reward and, consequently, increase the probability of satisfying $\phi$. We evaluate HYPRL on a diverse set of benchmarks, including safety-aware planning, Deep Sea Treasure, and the Post Correspondence Problem. We also compare with specification-driven baselines to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of HYPRL.

Abstract: Dynamic scheduling in real-world environments often struggles to adapt to unforeseen disruptions, making traditional static scheduling methods and human-designed heuristics inadequate. This paper introduces an innovative approach that combines Genetic Programming (GP) with a Transformer trained through Reinforcement Learning (GPRT), specifically designed to tackle the complexities of dynamic scheduling scenarios. GPRT leverages the Transformer to refine heuristics generated by GP while also seeding and guiding the evolution of GP. This dual functionality enhances the adaptability and effectiveness of the scheduling heuristics, enabling them to better respond to the dynamic nature of real-world tasks. The efficacy of this integrated approach is demonstrated through a practical application in container terminal truck scheduling, where the GPRT method outperforms traditional GP, standalone Transformer methods, and other state-of-the-art competitors. The key contribution of this research is the development of the GPRT method, which showcases a novel combination of GP and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to produce robust and efficient scheduling solutions. Importantly, GPRT is not limited to container port truck scheduling; it offers a versatile framework applicable to various dynamic scheduling challenges. Its practicality, coupled with its interpretability and ease of modification, makes it a valuable tool for diverse real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Reasoning is a fundamental cognitive process that enables logical inference, problem-solving, and decision-making. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), reasoning has emerged as a key capability that distinguishes advanced AI systems from conventional models that empower chatbots. In this survey, we categorize existing methods along two orthogonal dimensions: (1) Regimes, which define the stage at which reasoning is achieved (either at inference time or through dedicated training); and (2) Architectures, which determine the components involved in the reasoning process, distinguishing between standalone LLMs and agentic compound systems that incorporate external tools, and multi-agent collaborations. Within each dimension, we analyze two key perspectives: (1) Input level, which focuses on techniques that construct high-quality prompts that the LLM condition on; and (2) Output level, which methods that refine multiple sampled candidates to enhance reasoning quality. This categorization provides a systematic understanding of the evolving landscape of LLM reasoning, highlighting emerging trends such as the shift from inference-scaling to learning-to-reason (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), and the transition to agentic workflows (e.g., OpenAI Deep Research, Manus Agent). Additionally, we cover a broad spectrum of learning algorithms, from supervised fine-tuning to reinforcement learning such as PPO and GRPO, and the training of reasoners and verifiers. We also examine key designs of agentic workflows, from established patterns like generator-evaluator and LLM debate to recent innovations. ...

Abstract: Frontier models that generate extended reasoning traces inadvertently produce rich token sequences that can facilitate model distillation. Recognizing this vulnerability, model owners may seek sampling strategies that limit the effectiveness of distillation without compromising model performance. Antidistillation sampling provides exactly this capability. By strategically modifying a model's next-token probability distribution, antidistillation sampling poisons reasoning traces, rendering them significantly less effective for distillation while preserving the model's practical utility.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in clinical decision support, yet their application to triage remains underexplored. We systematically investigate the capabilities of LLMs in emergency department triage through two key dimensions: (1) robustness to distribution shifts and missing data, and (2) counterfactual analysis of intersectional biases across sex and race. We assess multiple LLM-based approaches, ranging from continued pre-training to in-context learning, as well as machine learning approaches. Our results indicate that LLMs exhibit superior robustness, and we investigate the key factors contributing to the promising LLM-based approaches. Furthermore, in this setting, we identify gaps in LLM preferences that emerge in particular intersections of sex and race. LLMs generally exhibit sex-based differences, but they are most pronounced in certain racial groups. These findings suggest that LLMs encode demographic preferences that may emerge in specific clinical contexts or particular combinations of characteristics.

Abstract: Evaluating the open-ended outputs of Large Multimodal Models has become a bottleneck as model capabilities, task diversity, and modality rapidly expand. Existing "LLM-as-a-Judge" evaluators are typically narrow in specific tasks and aspects. In this paper, we argue that, on one hand, based on the interconnected nature of aspects, learning specific aspects can generalize to unseen aspects; on the other hand, jointly learning to assess multiple visual aspects and tasks may foster a synergistic effect. To this end, we propose UFEval, the first unified fine-grained evaluator with task and aspect generalization for four evaluation tasks -- Natural Language Generation, Image Understanding, Image Generation, and Interleaved Text-and-Image Generation. Specifically, (1) We first construct a hierarchical aspect taxonomy encompassing 112 distinct aspects across the aforementioned four tasks. (2) Then, building upon this taxonomy, we create FRABench, a fine-grained evaluation dataset comprising 60.4k pairwise samples with 325k evaluation labels obtained from a combination of human and GPT-4o annotations. FRABench provides a large-scale, multi-modal, and aspect-level resource for training and testing evaluators. (3) Finally, leveraging FRABench, we develop UFEval, a unified fine-grained evaluator. Experiments show that learning on specific aspects enables UFEval to generalize to unseen aspects, and joint learning to assess diverse tasks and aspects can lead to substantial mutual benefits.

<title>Consistency-based Abductive Reasoning over Perceptual Errors of Multiple Pre-trained Models in Novel Environments</title>

Abstract: The deployment of pre-trained perception models in novel environments often leads to performance degradation due to distributional shifts. Although recent artificial intelligence approaches for metacognition use logical rules to characterize and filter model errors, improving precision often comes at the cost of reduced recall. This paper addresses the hypothesis that leveraging multiple pre-trained models can mitigate this recall reduction. We formulate the challenge of identifying and managing conflicting predictions from various models as a consistency-based abduction problem, building on the idea of abductive learning (ABL) but applying it to test-time instead of training. The input predictions and the learned error detection rules derived from each model are encoded in a logic program. We then seek an abductive explanation--a subset of model predictions--that maximizes prediction coverage while ensuring the rate of logical inconsistencies (derived from domain constraints) remains below a specified threshold. We propose two algorithms for this knowledge representation task: an exact method based on Integer Programming (IP) and an efficient Heuristic Search (HS). Through extensive experiments on a simulated aerial imagery dataset featuring controlled, complex distributional shifts, we demonstrate that our abduction-based framework outperforms individual models and standard ensemble baselines, achieving, for instance, average relative improvements of approximately 13.6\% in F1-score and 16.6\% in accuracy across 15 diverse test datasets when compared to the best individual model. Our results validate the use of consistency-based abduction as an effective mechanism to robustly integrate knowledge from multiple imperfect models in challenging, novel scenarios.

Abstract: Unified Cognitive Consciousness Theory} (UCCT) casts them instead as vast unconscious pattern repositories: apparent reasoning arises only when external anchoring mechanisms, few shot prompts, retrieval-augmented context, fine-tuning, or multi-agent debate, activate task-relevant patterns. UCCT formalizes this process as Bayesian competition between statistical priors learned in pre-training and context-driven target patterns, yielding a single quantitative account that unifies existing adaptation techniques. We ground the theory in three principles: threshold crossing, modality universality, and density-distance predictive power, and validate them with (i) cross-domain demonstrations (text QA, image captioning, multi-agent debate) and (ii) two depth-oriented experiments: a controlled numeral-base study (bases 8, 9, 10) that isolates pattern-density effects, and a layer-wise trajectory analysis that reveals phase transitions inside a 7B-parameter model. Both experiments confirm UCCT's predictions of threshold behavior, asymmetric interference, and memory hysteresis. By showing that LLM ``intelligence'' is created through semantic anchoring rather than contained within the model, UCCT offers a principled foundation for interpretable diagnostics and practical guidance for prompt engineering, model selection, and alignment-centric system design.

Abstract: A KG represents a network of entities and illustrates relationships between them. KGs are used for various applications, including semantic search and discovery, reasoning, decision-making, natural language processing, machine learning, and recommendation systems. Triple (subject-relation-object) extraction from text is the fundamental building block of KG construction and has been widely studied, for example, in early benchmarks such as ACE 2002 to more recent ones, such as WebNLG 2020, REBEL and SynthIE. While the use of LLMs is explored for KG construction, handcrafting reasonable task-specific prompts for LLMs is a labour-intensive exercise and can be brittle due to subtle changes in the LLM models employed. Recent work in NLP tasks (e.g. autonomy generation) uses automatic prompt optimization/engineering to address this challenge by generating optimal or near-optimal task-specific prompts given input-output examples.
  This empirical study explores the application of automatic prompt optimization for the triple extraction task using experimental benchmarking. We evaluate different settings by changing (a) the prompting strategy, (b) the LLM being used for prompt optimization and task execution, (c) the number of canonical relations in the schema (schema complexity), (d) the length and diversity of input text, (e) the metric used to drive the prompt optimization, and (f) the dataset being used for training and testing. We evaluate three different automatic prompt optimizers, namely, DSPy, APE, and TextGrad and use two different triple extraction datasets, SynthIE and REBEL. Through rigorous empirical evaluation, our main contribution highlights that automatic prompt optimization techniques can generate reasonable prompts similar to humans for triple extraction. In turn, these optimized prompts achieve improved results, particularly with increasing schema complexity and text size.

Abstract: We present our method for automatically marking Physics exams. The marking problem consists in assessing typed student answers for correctness with respect to a ground truth solution. This is a challenging problem that we seek to tackle using a combination of a computer algebra system, an SMT solver and a term rewriting system. A Large Language Model is used to interpret and remove errors from student responses and rewrite these in a machine readable format. Once formalized and language-aligned, the next step then consists in applying automated reasoning techniques for assessing student solution correctness. We consider two methods of automated theorem proving: off-the-shelf SMT solving and term rewriting systems tailored for physics problems involving trigonometric expressions. The development of the term rewrite system and establishing termination and confluence properties was not trivial, and we describe it in some detail in the paper. We evaluate our system on a rich pool of over 1500 real-world student exam responses from the 2023 Australian Physics Olympiad.

Abstract: Pain is a complex and pervasive condition that affects a significant portion of the population. Accurate and consistent assessment is essential for individuals suffering from pain, as well as for developing effective management strategies in a healthcare system. Automatic pain assessment systems enable continuous monitoring, support clinical decision-making, and help minimize patient distress while mitigating the risk of functional deterioration. Leveraging physiological signals offers objective and precise insights into a person's state, and their integration in a multimodal framework can further enhance system performance. This study has been submitted to the \textit{Second Multimodal Sensing Grand Challenge for Next-Gen Pain Assessment (AI4PAIN)}. The proposed approach introduces \textit{Tiny-BioMoE}, a lightweight pretrained embedding model for biosignal analysis. Trained on $4.4$ million biosignal image representations and consisting of only $7.3$ million parameters, it serves as an effective tool for extracting high-quality embeddings for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments involving electrodermal activity, blood volume pulse, respiratory signals, peripheral oxygen saturation, and their combinations highlight the model's effectiveness across diverse modalities in automatic pain recognition tasks. \textit{\textcolor{blue}{The model's architecture (code) and weights are available at https://github.com/GkikasStefanos/Tiny-BioMoE.

Abstract: Tensor parallelism is an essential technique for distributed training of large neural networks. However, automatically determining an optimal tensor parallel strategy is challenging due to the gigantic search space, which grows exponentially with model size and tensor dimension. This prohibits the adoption of auto-parallel systems on larger models.
  We observe that neural networks usually contain repeated substructures, and build an automatic parallelism framework named TAPAS that eliminates redundant search efforts. TAPAS employs a divide-and-conquer approach that efficiently folds the search space by identifying those unique substructures. As a result, it runs at sub-linear complexity concerning the model size, making it a scalable solution for training large-scale networks. Our evaluations demonstrate that TAPAS outperforms the state-of-the-art automatic parallelism frameworks by up to $160\times$ in search speed on a wide range of models, and the performance of derived strategies is competitive or even better compared with the expert-engineered Megatron-LM library.

Abstract: Despite significant efforts towards extending the AGM paradigm of belief change beyond finitary logics, the computational aspects of AGM have remained almost untouched. We investigate the computability of AGM contraction on non-finitary logics, and show an intriguing negative result: there are infinitely many uncomputable AGM contraction functions in such logics. Drastically, we also show that the current de facto standard strategies to control computability, which rely on restricting the space of epistemic states, fail: uncomputability remains in all non-finitary cases. Motivated by this disruptive result, we propose new approaches to controlling computability beyond the finitary realm. Using Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) as a case study, we identify an infinite class of fully-rational AGM contraction functions that are computable by design. We use B\"uchi automata to construct such functions, and to represent and reason about LTL beliefs.

Abstract: As large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) gain prominence, ensuring their safe deployment has become critical. Recent studies have explored VLM robustness against jailbreak attacks-techniques that exploit model vulnerabilities to elicit harmful outputs. However, the limited availability of diverse multimodal data has constrained current approaches to rely heavily on adversarial or manually crafted images derived from harmful text datasets, which often lack effectiveness and diversity across different contexts. In this paper, we propose IDEATOR, a novel jailbreak method that autonomously generates malicious image-text pairs for black-box jailbreak attacks. IDEATOR is grounded in the insight that VLMs themselves could serve as powerful red team models for generating multimodal jailbreak prompts. Specifically, IDEATOR leverages a VLM to create targeted jailbreak texts and pairs them with jailbreak images generated by a state-of-the-art diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate IDEATOR's high effectiveness and transferability, achieving a 94% attack success rate (ASR) in jailbreaking MiniGPT-4 with an average of only 5.34 queries, and high ASRs of 82%, 88%, and 75% when transferred to LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and Chameleon, respectively. Building on IDEATOR's strong transferability and automated process, we introduce the VLJailbreakBench, a safety benchmark comprising 3,654 multimodal jailbreak samples. Our benchmark results on 11 recently released VLMs reveal significant gaps in safety alignment. For instance, our challenge set achieves ASRs of 46.31% on GPT-4o and 19.65% on Claude-3.5-Sonnet, underscoring the urgent need for stronger defenses.

Abstract: Wireless ray-tracing (RT) is emerging as a key tool for three-dimensional (3D) wireless channel modeling, driven by advances in graphical rendering. Current approaches struggle to accurately model beyond 5G (B5G) network signaling, which often operates at higher frequencies and is more susceptible to environmental conditions and changes. Existing online learning solutions require real-time environmental supervision during training, which is both costly and incompatible with GPU-based processing. In response, we propose a novel approach that redefines ray trajectory generation as a sequential decision-making problem, leveraging generative models to jointly learn the optical, physical, and signal properties within each designated environment. Our work introduces the Scene-Aware Neural Decision Wireless Channel Raytracing Hierarchy (SANDWICH), an innovative offline, fully differentiable approach that can be trained entirely on GPUs. SANDWICH offers superior performance compared to existing online learning methods, outperforms the baseline by 4e^-2 radian in RT accuracy, and only fades 0.5 dB away from toplined channel gain estimation.

<title>Talking to DINO: Bridging Self-Supervised Vision Backbones with Language for Open-Vocabulary Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) aims at segmenting images from free-form textual concepts without predefined training classes. While existing vision-language models such as CLIP can generate segmentation masks by leveraging coarse spatial information from Vision Transformers, they face challenges in spatial localization due to their global alignment of image and text features. Conversely, self-supervised visual models like DINO excel in fine-grained visual encoding but lack integration with language. To bridge this gap, we present Talk2DINO, a novel hybrid approach that combines the spatial accuracy of DINOv2 with the language understanding of CLIP. Our approach aligns the textual embeddings of CLIP to the patch-level features of DINOv2 through a learned mapping function without the need to fine-tune the underlying backbones. At training time, we exploit the attention maps of DINOv2 to selectively align local visual patches with textual embeddings. We show that the powerful semantic and localization abilities of Talk2DINO can enhance the segmentation process, resulting in more natural and less noisy segmentations, and that our approach can also effectively distinguish foreground objects from the background. Experimental results demonstrate that Talk2DINO achieves state-of-the-art performance across several unsupervised OVS benchmarks.

<title>From Text to Trajectory: Exploring Complex Constraint Representation and Decomposition in Safe Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (RL) requires the agent to finish a given task while obeying specific constraints. Giving constraints in natural language form has great potential for practical scenarios due to its flexible transfer capability and accessibility. Previous safe RL methods with natural language constraints typically need to design cost functions manually for each constraint, which requires domain expertise and lacks flexibility. In this paper, we harness the dual role of text in this task, using it not only to provide constraint but also as a training signal. We introduce the Trajectory-level Textual Constraints Translator (TTCT) to replace the manually designed cost function. Our empirical results demonstrate that TTCT effectively comprehends textual constraint and trajectory, and the policies trained by TTCT can achieve a lower violation rate than the standard cost function. Extra studies are conducted to demonstrate that the TTCT has zero-shot transfer capability to adapt to constraint-shift environments.

Abstract: An image may convey a thousand words, but a video composed of hundreds or thousands of image frames tells a more intricate story. Despite significant progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), generating extended videos remains a formidable challenge. As of this writing, OpenAI's Sora, the current state-of-the-art system, is still limited to producing videos that are up to one minute in length. This limitation stems from the complexity of long video generation, which requires more than generative AI techniques for approximating density functions essential aspects such as planning, story development, and maintaining spatial and temporal consistency present additional hurdles. Integrating generative AI with a divide-and-conquer approach could improve scalability for longer videos while offering greater control. In this survey, we examine the current landscape of long video generation, covering foundational techniques like GANs and diffusion models, video generation strategies, large-scale training datasets, quality metrics for evaluating long videos, and future research areas to address the limitations of the existing video generation capabilities. We believe it would serve as a comprehensive foundation, offering extensive information to guide future advancements and research in the field of long video generation.

Abstract: The average-reward formulation of reinforcement learning (RL) has drawn increased interest in recent years for its ability to solve temporally-extended problems without relying on discounting. Meanwhile, in the discounted setting, algorithms with entropy regularization have been developed, leading to improvements over deterministic methods. Despite the distinct benefits of these approaches, deep RL algorithms for the entropy-regularized average-reward objective have not been developed. While policy-gradient based approaches have recently been presented for the average-reward literature, the corresponding actor-critic framework remains less explored. In this paper, we introduce an average-reward soft actor-critic algorithm to address these gaps in the field. We validate our method by comparing with existing average-reward algorithms on standard RL benchmarks, achieving superior performance for the average-reward criterion.

Abstract: The proliferation of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in the past several years calls for rigorous and comprehensive evaluation methods and benchmarks. This work analyzes existing VLM evaluation techniques, including automated metrics, AI-based assessments, and human evaluations across diverse tasks. We first introduce Robin - a novel suite of VLMs that we built by combining Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Encoders (VEs) at multiple scales, and use Robin to identify shortcomings of current evaluation approaches across scales. Next, to overcome the identified limitations, we introduce CHIRP - a new long form response benchmark we developed for more robust and complete VLM evaluation. We provide open access to the Robin training code, model suite, and CHIRP benchmark to promote reproducibility and advance VLM research.

Abstract: Wireless positioning technologies hold significant value for applications in autonomous driving, extended reality (XR), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and more. With the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), leveraging AI to enhance positioning accuracy and robustness has emerged as a field full of potential. Driven by the requirements and functionalities defined in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards, AI/machine learning (ML)-based cellular positioning is becoming a key technology to overcome the limitations of traditional methods. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of AI-driven cellular positioning. We begin by reviewing the fundamentals of wireless positioning and AI models, analyzing their respective challenges and synergies. We provide a comprehensive review of the evolution of 3GPP positioning standards, with a focus on the integration of AI/ML in current and upcoming standard releases. Guided by the 3GPP-defined taxonomy, we categorize and summarize state-of-the-art (SOTA) research into two major classes: AI/ML-assisted positioning and direct AI/ML-based positioning. The former includes line-of-sight (LOS)/non-line-of-sight (NLOS) detection, time of arrival (TOA)/time difference of arrival (TDOA) estimation, and angle prediction; the latter encompasses fingerprinting, knowledge-assisted learning, and channel charting. Furthermore, we review representative public datasets and conduct performance evaluations of AI-based positioning algorithms using these datasets. Finally, we conclude by summarizing the challenges and opportunities of AI-driven wireless positioning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive multilingual capabilities through pretraining on diverse corpora. Although these models show strong reasoning abilities, their performance varies significantly between languages due to the imbalanced distribution of training data. Existing approaches using sample-level translation for extensive multilingual pretraining and cross-lingual tuning face scalability challenges and often fail to capture nuanced reasoning processes across languages. In this paper, we introduce AdaMCOT (Adaptive Multilingual Chain-of-Thought), a framework that enhances multilingual factual reasoning by dynamically routing thought processes in intermediary "thinking languages" before generating target-language responses. AdaMCOT leverages a language-agnostic core and incorporates an adaptive, reward-based mechanism for selecting optimal reasoning pathways without requiring additional pretraining. Our comprehensive evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates substantial improvements in both factual reasoning quality and cross-lingual consistency, with particularly strong performance gains in low-resource language settings. An in-depth analysis of the model's hidden states and semantic space further elucidates the underlying mechanism of our method. The results suggest that adaptive reasoning paths can effectively bridge the performance gap between high and low-resource languages while maintaining cultural and linguistic nuances.

<title>CAMEF: Causal-Augmented Multi-Modality Event-Driven Financial Forecasting by Integrating Time Series Patterns and Salient Macroeconomic Announcements</title>

arXiv:2502.04592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately forecasting the impact of macroeconomic events is critical for investors and policymakers. Salient events like monetary policy decisions and employment reports often trigger market movements by shaping expectations of economic growth and risk, thereby establishing causal relationships between events and market behavior. Existing forecasting methods typically focus either on textual analysis or time-series modeling, but fail to capture the multi-modal nature of financial markets and the causal relationship between events and price movements. To address these gaps, we propose CAMEF (Causal-Augmented Multi-Modality Event-Driven Financial Forecasting), a multi-modality framework that effectively integrates textual and time-series data with a causal learning mechanism and an LLM-based counterfactual event augmentation technique for causal-enhanced financial forecasting. Our contributions include: (1) a multi-modal framework that captures causal relationships between policy texts and historical price data; (2) a new financial dataset with six types of macroeconomic releases from 2008 to April 2024, and high-frequency real trading data for five key U.S. financial assets; and (3) an LLM-based counterfactual event augmentation strategy. We compare CAMEF to state-of-the-art transformer-based time-series and multi-modal baselines, and perform ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the causal learning mechanism and event types.

Abstract: Transformer models map input token sequences to output token distributions, layer by layer. While most interpretability work focuses on internal latent representations, we study the evolution of these token-level distributions directly in vocabulary space. However, such distributions are high-dimensional and defined on an unordered support, making common descriptors like moments or cumulants ill-suited. We address this by computing the Shannon entropy of each intermediate predicted distribution, yielding one interpretable scalar per layer. The resulting sequence, the entropy profile, serves as a compact, information-theoretic signature of the model's computation. We introduce Entropy-Lens, a model-agnostic framework that extracts entropy profiles from frozen, off-the-shelf transformers. We show that these profiles (i) reveal family-specific computation patterns invariant under depth rescaling, (ii) are predictive of prompt type and task format, and (iii) correlate with output correctness. We further show that R\'enyi entropies yield similar results within a broad range of $\alpha$ values, justifying the use of Shannon entropy as a stable and principled summary. Our results hold across different transformers, without requiring gradients, fine-tuning, or access to model internals.

Abstract: Dexterous grasping remains a fundamental yet challenging problem in robotics. A general-purpose robot must be capable of grasping diverse objects in arbitrary scenarios. However, existing research typically relies on restrictive assumptions, such as single-object settings or limited environments, showing constrained generalization. We present DexGraspVLA, a hierarchical framework for robust generalization in language-guided general dexterous grasping and beyond. It utilizes a pre-trained Vision-Language model as the high-level planner and learns a diffusion-based low-level Action controller. The key insight to achieve generalization lies in iteratively transforming diverse language and visual inputs into domain-invariant representations via foundation models, where imitation learning can be effectively applied due to the alleviation of domain shift. Notably, our method achieves a 90+% dexterous grasping success rate under thousands of challenging unseen cluttered scenes. Empirical analysis confirms the consistency of internal model behavior across environmental variations, validating our design. DexGraspVLA also, for the first time, simultaneously demonstrates free-form long-horizon prompt execution, robustness to adversarial objects and human disturbance, and failure recovery. Extended application to nonprehensile grasping further proves its generality. Project website: https://dexgraspvla.github.io.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful capabilities in code generation, natural language understanding, and domain-specific reasoning. Their application to quantum software development remains limited, in part because of the lack of high-quality datasets both for LLM training and as dependable knowledge sources. To bridge this gap, we introduce PennyLang, an off-the-shelf, high-quality dataset of 3,347 PennyLane-specific quantum code samples with contextual descriptions, curated from textbooks, official documentation, and open-source repositories. Our contributions are threefold: (1) the creation and open-source release of PennyLang, a purpose-built dataset for quantum programming with PennyLane; (2) a framework for automated quantum code dataset construction that systematizes curation, annotation, and formatting to maximize downstream LLM usability; and (3) a baseline evaluation of the dataset across multiple open-source models, including ablation studies, all conducted within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline. Using PennyLang with RAG substantially improves performance: for example, Qwen 7B's success rate rises from 8.7% without retrieval to 41.7% with full-context augmentation, and LLaMa 4 improves from 78.8% to 84.8%, while also reducing hallucinations and enhancing quantum code correctness. Moving beyond Qiskit-focused studies, we bring LLM-based tools and reproducible methods to PennyLane for advancing AI-assisted quantum development.

Abstract: Image quality plays an important role in the performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) that have been widely shown to exhibit sensitivity to changes in imaging conditions. Conventional image quality assessment (IQA) seeks to measure and align quality relative to human perceptual judgments, but we often need a metric that is not only sensitive to imaging conditions but also well-aligned with DNN sensitivities. We first ask whether conventional IQA metrics are also informative of DNN performance. We show theoretically and empirically that conventional IQA metrics are weak predictors of DNN performance for image classification. Using our causal framework, we then develop metrics that exhibit strong correlation with DNN performance, thus enabling us to effectively estimate the quality distribution of large image datasets relative to targeted vision tasks.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for consolidating multi-turn adversarial ``jailbreak'' prompts into single-turn queries, significantly reducing the manual overhead required for adversarial testing of large language models (LLMs). While multi-turn human jailbreaks have been shown to yield high attack success rates, they demand considerable human effort and time. Our multi-turn-to-single-turn (M2S) methods -- Hyphenize, Numberize, and Pythonize -- systematically reformat multi-turn dialogues into structured single-turn prompts. Despite removing iterative back-and-forth interactions, these prompts preserve and often enhance adversarial potency: in extensive evaluations on the Multi-turn Human Jailbreak (MHJ) dataset, M2S methods achieve attack success rates from 70.6 percent to 95.9 percent across several state-of-the-art LLMs. Remarkably, the single-turn prompts outperform the original multi-turn attacks by as much as 17.5 percentage points while cutting token usage by more than half on average. Further analysis shows that embedding malicious requests in enumerated or code-like structures exploits ``contextual blindness'', bypassing both native guardrails and external input-output filters. By converting multi-turn conversations into concise single-turn prompts, the M2S framework provides a scalable tool for large-scale red teaming and reveals critical weaknesses in contemporary LLM defenses.

Abstract: Fitting a body to a 3D clothed human point cloud is a common yet challenging task. Traditional optimization-based approaches use multi-stage pipelines that are sensitive to pose initialization, while recent learning-based methods often struggle with generalization across diverse poses and garment types. We propose Equivariant Tightness Fitting for Clothed Humans, or ETCH, a novel pipeline that estimates cloth-to-body surface mapping through locally approximate SE(3) equivariance, encoding tightness as displacement vectors from the cloth surface to the underlying body. Following this mapping, pose-invariant body features regress sparse body markers, simplifying clothed human fitting into an inner-body marker fitting task. Extensive experiments on CAPE and 4D-Dress show that ETCH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods -- both tightness-agnostic and tightness-aware -- in body fitting accuracy on loose clothing (16.7% ~ 69.5%) and shape accuracy (average 49.9%). Our equivariant tightness design can even reduce directional errors by (67.2% ~ 89.8%) in one-shot (or out-of-distribution) settings (~ 1% data). Qualitative results demonstrate strong generalization of ETCH, regardless of challenging poses, unseen shapes, loose clothing, and non-rigid dynamics. We will release the code and models soon for research purposes at https://boqian-li.github.io/ETCH/.

Abstract: Gradient optimization-based adversarial attack methods automate the learning of adversarial triggers to generate jailbreak prompts or leak system prompts. In this work, we take a closer look at the optimization objective of adversarial trigger learning and propose ATLA: Adversarial Trigger Learning with Augmented objectives. ATLA improves the negative log-likelihood loss used by previous studies into a weighted loss formulation that encourages the learned adversarial triggers to optimize more towards response format tokens. This enables ATLA to learn an adversarial trigger from just one query-response pair and the learned trigger generalizes well to other similar queries. We further design a variation to augment trigger optimization with an auxiliary loss that suppresses evasive responses. We showcase how to use ATLA to learn adversarial suffixes jailbreaking LLMs and to extract hidden system prompts. Empirically we demonstrate that ATLA consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques, achieving nearly 100% success in attacking while requiring 80% fewer queries. ATLA learned jailbreak suffixes demonstrate high generalization to unseen queries and transfer well to new LLMs. We released our code \href{https://github.com/QData/ALTA_Augmented_Adversarial_Trigger_Learning}{here}.

Abstract: Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPTs) are foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) for text generation. However, individual LLMs often produce inconsistent outputs and exhibit biases, limiting their representation of diverse language patterns. The closed-source nature of many powerful LLMs further restricts industry applications due to data privacy concerns. Inspired by successes in text generation, LLM ensemble techniques are now increasingly explored for code generation. This article reviews these emerging ensemble approaches to enhance understanding, encourage further research, and promote practical implementation in both text and code generation. We categorize LLM ensembles into seven main methods - weight merging, knowledge fusion, mixture-of-experts, reward ensemble, output ensemble, routing, and cascading - analyzing capabilities of those approaches. Our findings highlight key benefits such as improved diversity representation, enhanced output quality, and greater application flexibility. These insights aid model selection for real-world tasks and crucially, lay groundwork for extending ensemble strategies to multimodal LLMs.

Abstract: The ensemble average of physical properties of molecules is closely related to the distribution of molecular conformations, and sampling such distributions is a fundamental challenge in physics and chemistry. Traditional methods like molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling are commonly used but can be time-consuming and costly. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as efficient alternatives by learning the distribution of training data. Obtaining an unbiased target distribution is still an expensive task, primarily because it requires satisfying ergodicity. To tackle these challenges, we propose Potential Score Matching (PSM), an approach that utilizes the potential energy gradient to guide generative models. PSM does not require exact energy functions and can debias sample distributions even when trained on limited and biased data. Our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential, a commonly used toy model. Furthermore, we extend the evaluation of PSM to high-dimensional problems using the MD17 and MD22 datasets. The results demonstrate that molecular distributions generated by PSM more closely approximate the Boltzmann distribution compared to traditional diffusion models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown promise in Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS). However, their direct application to ADS is hindered by challenges such as misunderstanding of traffic knowledge, complex road conditions, and diverse states of vehicle. To address these challenges, we propose the use of Knowledge Editing, which enables targeted modifications to a model's behavior without the need for full retraining. Meanwhile, we introduce ADS-Edit, a multimodal knowledge editing dataset specifically designed for ADS, which includes various real-world scenarios, multiple data types, and comprehensive evaluation metrics. We conduct comprehensive experiments and derive several interesting conclusions. We hope that our work will contribute to the further advancement of knowledge editing applications in the field of autonomous driving.

Abstract: Omnidirectional depth perception is essential for mobile robotics applications that require scene understanding across a full 360{\deg} field of view. Camera-based setups offer a cost-effective option by using stereo depth estimation to generate dense, high-resolution depth maps without relying on expensive active sensing. However, existing omnidirectional stereo matching approaches achieve only limited depth accuracy across diverse environments, depth ranges, and lighting conditions, due to the scarcity of real-world data. We present DFI-OmniStereo, a novel omnidirectional stereo matching method that leverages a large-scale pre-trained foundation model for relative monocular depth estimation within an iterative optimization-based stereo matching architecture. We introduce a dedicated two-stage training strategy to utilize the relative monocular depth features for our omnidirectional stereo matching before scale-invariant fine-tuning. DFI-OmniStereo achieves state-of-the-art results on the real-world Helvipad dataset, reducing disparity MAE by approximately 16% compared to the previous best omnidirectional stereo method.

Abstract: Architecture design and optimization are challenging problems in the field of artificial neural networks. Working in this context, we here present SPARCS (SPectral ARchiteCture Search), a novel architecture search protocol which exploits the spectral attributes of the inter-layer transfer matrices. SPARCS allows one to explore the space of possible architectures by spanning continuous and differentiable manifolds, thus enabling for gradient-based optimization algorithms to be eventually employed. With reference to simple benchmark models, we show that the newly proposed method yields a self-emerging architecture with a minimal degree of expressivity to handle the task under investigation and with a reduced parameter count as compared to other viable alternatives.

Abstract: Single-photon Lidar imaging offers a significant advantage in 3D imaging due to its high resolution and long-range capabilities, however it is challenging to apply in noisy environments with multiple targets per pixel. To tackle these challenges, several methods have been proposed. Statistical methods demonstrate interpretability on the inferred parameters, but they are often limited in their ability to handle complex scenes. Deep learning-based methods have shown superior performance in terms of accuracy and robustness, but they lack interpretability or they are limited to a single-peak per pixel. In this paper, we propose a deep unrolling algorithm for dual-peak single-photon Lidar imaging. We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian model for multiple targets and propose a neural network that unrolls the underlying statistical method. To support multiple targets, we adopt a dual depth maps representation and exploit geometric deep learning to extract features from the point cloud. The proposed method takes advantages of statistical methods and learning-based methods in terms of accuracy and quantifying uncertainty. The experimental results on synthetic and real data demonstrate the competitive performance when compared to existing methods, while also providing uncertainty information.

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-dimensional data but fall short in training efficiency and representation quality compared to self-supervised methods. We identify a key bottleneck: the underutilization of high-quality, semantically rich representations during training notably slows down convergence. Our systematic analysis reveals a critical representation processing region -- primarily in the early layers -- where semantic and structural pattern learning takes place before generation can occur. To address this, we propose Embedded Representation Warmup (ERW), a plug-and-play framework where in the first stage we get the ERW module serves as a warmup that initializes the early layers of the diffusion model with high-quality, pretrained representations. This warmup minimizes the burden of learning representations from scratch, thereby accelerating convergence and boosting performance. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that ERW's efficacy depends on its precise integration into specific neural network layers -- termed the representation processing region -- where the model primarily processes and transforms feature representations for later generation. We further establish that ERW not only accelerates training convergence but also enhances representation quality: empirically, our method achieves a 40$\times$ acceleration in training speed compared to REPA, the current state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at https://github.com/LINs-lab/ERW.

Abstract: Clinical case reports and discharge summaries may be the most complete and accurate summarization of patient encounters, yet they are finalized, i.e., timestamped after the encounter. Complementary data structured streams become available sooner but suffer from incompleteness. To train models and algorithms on more complete and temporally fine-grained data, we construct a pipeline to phenotype, extract, and annotate time-localized findings within case reports using large language models. We apply our pipeline to generate an open-access textual time series corpus for Sepsis-3 comprising 2,139 case reports from the Pubmed-Open Access (PMOA) Subset. To validate our system, we apply it on PMOA and timeline annotations from I2B2/MIMIC-IV and compare the results to physician-expert annotations. We show high recovery rates of clinical findings (event match rates: O1-preview--0.755, Llama 3.3 70B Instruct--0.753) and strong temporal ordering (concordance: O1-preview--0.932, Llama 3.3 70B Instruct--0.932). Our work characterizes the ability of LLMs to time-localize clinical findings in text, illustrating the limitations of LLM use for temporal reconstruction and providing several potential avenues of improvement via multimodal integration.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable performance across various natural language processing tasks but suffer from immense computational and memory demands, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address this challenge, we propose NoWag: (Normalized Weight and Activation Guided Compression), a unified framework for zero-shot shape preserving compression algorithms. We compressed Llama-2 7B/13B/70B and Llama-3 8/70BB models, using two popular forms of shape-preserving compression, vector quantization NoWag-VQ (NoWag for Vector Quantization), and unstructured/semi-structured pruning NoWag-P (NoWag for Pruning). We found that NoWag-VQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art zero shot VQ, and that NoWag-P performs competitively against state-of-the-art methods. These results suggest commonalities between these compression paradigms that could inspire future work. Our code is available at https://github.com/LawrenceRLiu/NoWag

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted in educational settings. These applications expand beyond English, though current LLMs remain primarily English-centric. In this work, we ascertain if their use in education settings in non-English languages is warranted. We evaluated the performance of popular LLMs on four educational tasks: identifying student misconceptions, providing targeted feedback, interactive tutoring, and grading translations in eight languages (Mandarin, Hindi, Arabic, German, Farsi, Telugu, Ukrainian, Czech) in addition to English. We find that the performance on these tasks somewhat corresponds to the amount of language represented in training data, with lower-resource languages having poorer task performance. Although the models perform reasonably well in most languages, the frequent performance drop from English is significant. Thus, we recommend that practitioners first verify that the LLM works well in the target language for their educational task before deployment.

<title>FFCBA: Feature-based Full-target Clean-label Backdoor Attacks</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21054</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.21054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to deep neural networks, as backdoored models would misclassify poisoned samples with specific triggers into target classes while maintaining normal performance on clean samples. Among these, multi-target backdoor attacks can simultaneously target multiple classes. However, existing multi-target backdoor attacks all follow the dirty-label paradigm, where poisoned samples are mislabeled, and most of them require an extremely high poisoning rate. This makes them easily detectable by manual inspection. In contrast, clean-label attacks are more stealthy, as they avoid modifying the labels of poisoned samples. However, they generally struggle to achieve stable and satisfactory attack performance and often fail to scale effectively to multi-target attacks. To address this issue, we propose the Feature-based Full-target Clean-label Backdoor Attacks (FFCBA) which consists of two paradigms: Feature-Spanning Backdoor Attacks (FSBA) and Feature-Migrating Backdoor Attacks (FMBA). FSBA leverages class-conditional autoencoders to generate noise triggers that align perturbed in-class samples with the original category's features, ensuring the effectiveness, intra-class consistency, inter-class specificity and natural-feature correlation of triggers. While FSBA supports swift and efficient attacks, its cross-model attack capability is relatively weak. FMBA employs a two-stage class-conditional autoencoder training process that alternates between using out-of-class samples and in-class samples. This allows FMBA to generate triggers with strong target-class features, making it highly effective for cross-model attacks. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets and models, the results show that FFCBA achieves outstanding attack performance and maintains desirable robustness against the state-of-the-art backdoor defenses.

Abstract: We present JointDiT, a diffusion transformer that models the joint distribution of RGB and depth. By leveraging the architectural benefit and outstanding image prior of the state-of-the-art diffusion transformer, JointDiT not only generates high-fidelity images but also produces geometrically plausible and accurate depth maps. This solid joint distribution modeling is achieved through two simple yet effective techniques that we propose, namely, adaptive scheduling weights, which depend on the noise levels of each modality, and the unbalanced timestep sampling strategy. With these techniques, we train our model across all noise levels for each modality, enabling JointDiT to naturally handle various combinatorial generation tasks, including joint generation, depth estimation, and depth-conditioned image generation by simply controlling the timesteps of each branch. JointDiT demonstrates outstanding joint generation performance. Furthermore, it achieves comparable results in depth estimation and depth-conditioned image generation, suggesting that joint distribution modeling can serve as a viable alternative to conditional generation.

<title>GRILL: Gradient Signal Restoration in Ill-Conditioned Layers to Enhance Adversarial Attacks on Autoencoders</title>

arXiv:2505.03646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial robustness of deep autoencoders (AEs) remains relatively unexplored, even though their non-invertible nature poses distinct challenges. Existing attack algorithms during the optimization of imperceptible, norm-bounded adversarial perturbations to maximize output damage in AEs, often stop at sub-optimal attacks. We observe that the adversarial loss gradient vanishes when backpropagated through ill-conditioned layers. This issue arises from near-zero singular values in the Jacobians of these layers, which weaken the gradient signal during optimization. We introduce GRILL, a technique that locally restores gradient signals in ill-conditioned layers, enabling more effective norm-bounded attacks. Through extensive experiments on different architectures of popular AEs, under both sample-specific and universal attack setups, and across standard and adaptive attack settings, we show that our method significantly increases the effectiveness of our adversarial attacks, enabling a more rigorous evaluation of AE robustness.

Abstract: Optical computing systems deliver unrivalled processing speeds for scalar operations. Yet, integrated implementations have been constrained to low-dimensional tensor operations that fall short of the vector dimensions required for modern artificial intelligence. We demonstrate an all-optical neuromorphic computing system based on time division multiplexing, capable of processing input vectors exceeding 250,000 elements within a unified framework. The platform harnesses optically driven thermo-optic modulation in standing wave optical fields, with titanium nano-antennas functioning as wavelength-selective absorbers. Counterintuitively, the thermal time dynamics of the system enable simultaneous time integration of ultra-fast (50GHz) signals and the application of programmable, non-linear activation functions, entirely within the optical domain. This unified framework constitutes a leap towards large-scale photonic computing that satisfies the dimensional requirements of AI workloads.

Abstract: Modern automotive infotainment systems necessitate intelligent and adaptive solutions to manage frequent User Interface (UI) updates and diverse design variations. This work introduces a vision-language framework to facilitate the understanding of and interaction with automotive UIs, enabling seamless adaptation across different UI designs. To support research in this field, AutomotiveUI-Bench-4K, an open-source dataset comprising 998 images with 4,208 annotations, is also released. Additionally, a data pipeline for generating training data is presented. A Molmo-7B-based model is fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRa), incorporating generated reasoning along with visual grounding and evaluation capabilities. The fine-tuned Evaluative Large Action Model (ELAM) achieves strong performance on AutomotiveUI-Bench-4K (model and dataset are available on Hugging Face). The approach demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization, including a +5.6% improvement on ScreenSpot over the baseline model. An average accuracy of 80.8% is achieved on ScreenSpot, closely matching or surpassing specialized models for desktop, mobile, and web, despite being trained primarily on the automotive domain. This research investigates how data collection and subsequent fine-tuning can lead to AI-driven advancements in automotive UI understanding and interaction. The applied method is cost-efficient, and fine-tuned models can be deployed on consumer-grade GPUs.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has demonstrated capabilities across various domains, but comprehensive benchmarks for agricultural remote sensing (RS) remain scarce. Existing benchmarks designed for agricultural RS scenarios exhibit notable limitations, primarily in terms of insufficient scene diversity in the dataset and oversimplified task design. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgroMind, a comprehensive agricultural remote sensing benchmark covering four task dimensions: spatial perception, object understanding, scene understanding, and scene reasoning, with a total of 13 task types, ranging from crop identification and health monitoring to environmental analysis. We curate a high-quality evaluation set by integrating eight public datasets and one private farmland plot dataset, containing 27,247 QA pairs and 19,615 images. The pipeline begins with multi-source data pre-processing, including collection, format standardization, and annotation refinement. We then generate a diverse set of agriculturally relevant questions through the systematic definition of tasks. Finally, we employ LMMs for inference, generating responses, and performing detailed examinations. We evaluated 20 open-source LMMs and 4 closed-source models on AgroMind. Experiments reveal significant performance gaps, particularly in spatial reasoning and fine-grained recognition, it is notable that human performance lags behind several leading LMMs. By establishing a standardized evaluation framework for agricultural RS, AgroMind reveals the limitations of LMMs in domain knowledge and highlights critical challenges for future work. Data and code can be accessed at https://rssysu.github.io/AgroMind/.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-based text retrieval retrieves documents relevant to search queries based on vector similarities. Documents are pre-encoded offline, while queries arrive in real-time, necessitating an efficient online query encoder. Although LLMs significantly enhance retrieval capabilities, serving deeply parameterized LLMs slows down query inference throughput and increases demands for online deployment resources. In this paper, we propose LightRetriever, a novel LLM-based retriever with extremely lightweight query encoders. Our method retains a full-sized LLM for document encoding, but reduces the workload of query encoding to no more than an embedding lookup. Compared to serving a full LLM on an A800 GPU, our method achieves over 1000x speedup in query encoding and over 10x increase in end-to-end retrieval throughput. Extensive experiments on large-scale retrieval benchmarks show that LightRetriever generalizes well across diverse tasks, maintaining an average of 95% retrieval performance.

Abstract: R1-style Reinforcement Learning (RL) significantly enhances Large Language Models' reasoning capabilities, yet the mechanism behind rule-based RL remains unclear. We found that small-scale SFT has substantial influence on RL but shows poor efficiency. To explain our observations, we propose an analytical framework and compare the efficiency of SFT and RL by measuring \textbf{sample effect}. Our hypothetical analysis shows the potential to improve SFT efficiency. Guided by our analysis, we propose \textbf{Re-distillation}, a technique that aims to boost the effectiveness of small-scale distillation by sampling from the RL-trained policy. Re-distillation shows consistent surprising efficiency on three datasets and both Qwen\&amp;Llama models: Re-distilled models matched RL performance with far fewer samples and less computation. As a result, on K\&amp;K dataset, our re-distilled Qwen-2.5-1.5B model surpasses DeepSeek-V3-0324 with only 1K SFT samples. We demonstrate that re-distillation can be used to efficiently balance multiple goals in RL. Our work explains several interesting phenomena in R1-style RL, shedding light on the mechanisms behind its empirical success. Code is available at: https://github.com/on1262/deep-reasoning.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) struggles with domain-specific enterprise datasets, often isolated behind firewalls and rich in complex, specialized terminology unseen by LLMs during pre-training. Semantic variability across domains like medicine, networking, or law hampers RAG's context precision, while fine-tuning solutions are costly, slow, and lack generalization as new data emerges. Achieving zero-shot precision with retrievers without fine-tuning still remains a key challenge. We introduce 'MetaGen Blended RAG', a novel enterprise search approach that enhances semantic retrievers through a metadata generation pipeline and hybrid query indexes using dense and sparse vectors. By leveraging key concepts, topics, and acronyms, our method creates metadata-enriched semantic indexes and boosted hybrid queries, delivering robust, scalable performance without fine-tuning. On the biomedical PubMedQA dataset, MetaGen Blended RAG achieves 82% retrieval accuracy and 77% RAG accuracy, surpassing all prior zero-shot RAG benchmarks and even rivaling fine-tuned models on that dataset, while also excelling on datasets like SQuAD and NQ. This approach redefines enterprise search using a new approach to building semantic retrievers with unmatched generalization across specialized domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer transformative capabilities for hardware design automation, particularly in Verilog code generation.

We introduce SALAD, a comprehensive assessment that leverages machine unlearning to mitigate these threats. Our approach enables the selective removal of contaminated benchmarks, sensitive IP and design artifacts, or malicious code patterns from pre-trained LLMs, all without requiring full retraining. Through detailed case studies, we demonstrate how machine unlearning techniques effectively reduce data security risks in LLM-aided hardware design.

Abstract: Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex tasks like reasoning or planning, play a substantial role in many cutting-edge commercial applications, and continue to fascinate researchers across nearly all fields for their potential to accomplish expensive, complex tasks that, until recently, only humans have been trusted to do. These workflows depend critically on the prompts used to provide the roles models play in such workflows. Poorly designed prompts that fail even slightly to guide individual agents can lead to sub-optimal performance that may snowball within a system of agents, limiting their reliability and scalability. To address this important problem of inference-time prompt optimization, we introduce ProRefine, an innovative inference-time optimization method that uses an agentic loop of LLMs to generate and apply textual feedback. ProRefine dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to approach the performance of their larger counterparts. This highlights its potential for building more cost-effective and powerful hybrid AI systems, thereby democratizing access to high-performing AI.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to automated harmful content detection tasks, assisting moderators in identifying policy violations and improving the overall efficiency and accuracy of content review. However, existing resources for harmful content detection are predominantly focused on English, with Chinese datasets remaining scarce and often limited in scope. We present a comprehensive, professionally annotated benchmark for Chinese content harm detection, which covers six representative categories and is constructed entirely from real-world data. Our annotation process further yields a knowledge rule base that provides explicit expert knowledge to assist LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection. In addition, we propose a knowledge-augmented baseline that integrates both human-annotated knowledge rules and implicit knowledge from large language models, enabling smaller models to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ChineseHarm-bench.

Abstract: Speech-language models (SLMs) offer a promising path toward unifying speech and text understanding and generation. However, challenges remain in achieving effective cross-modal alignment and high-quality speech generation. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of speech tokenizer designs in LLM-centric SLMs, augmented by speech heads and speaker modeling. We compare coupled, semi-decoupled, and fully decoupled speech tokenizers under a fair SLM framework and find that decoupled tokenization significantly improves alignment and synthesis quality. To address the information density mismatch between speech and text, we introduce multi-token prediction (MTP) into SLMs, enabling each hidden state to decode multiple speech tokens. This leads to up to 12$\times$ faster decoding and a substantial drop in word error rate (from 6.07 to 3.01). Furthermore, we propose a speaker-aware generation paradigm and introduce RoleTriviaQA, a large-scale role-playing knowledge QA benchmark with diverse speaker identities. Experiments demonstrate that our methods enhance both knowledge understanding and speaker consistency.

Abstract: Adapting text-to-image (T2I) latent diffusion models (LDMs) to video editing has shown strong visual fidelity and controllability, but challenges remain in maintaining causal relationships inherent to the video data generating process. Edits affecting causally dependent attributes often generate unrealistic or misleading outcomes if these relationships are ignored. In this work, we introduce a causally faithful framework for counterfactual video generation, formulated as an Out-of-Distribution (OOD) prediction problem. We embed prior causal knowledge by encoding the relationships specified in a causal graph into text prompts and guide the generation process by optimizing these prompts using a vision-language model (VLM)-based textual loss. This loss encourages the latent space of the LDMs to capture OOD variations in the form of counterfactuals, effectively steering generation toward causally meaningful alternatives. The proposed framework, dubbed CSVC, is agnostic to the underlying video editing system and does not require access to its internal mechanisms or fine-tuning. We evaluate our approach using standard video quality metrics and counterfactual-specific criteria, such as causal effectiveness and minimality. Experimental results show that CSVC generates causally faithful video counterfactuals within the LDM distribution via prompt-based causal steering, achieving state-of-the-art causal effectiveness without compromising temporal consistency or visual quality on real-world facial videos. Due to its compatibility with any black-box video editing system, our framework has significant potential to generate realistic 'what if' hypothetical video scenarios in diverse areas such as digital media and healthcare.

Abstract: An ideal traffic simulator replicates the realistic long-term point-to-point trip that a self-driving system experiences during deployment. Prior models and benchmarks focus on closed-loop motion simulation for initial agents in a scene. This is problematic for long-term simulation. Agents enter and exit the scene as the ego vehicle enters new regions. We propose InfGen, a unified next-token prediction model that performs interleaved closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation. InfGen automatically switches between closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation mode. It enables stable long-term rollout simulation. InfGen performs at the state-of-the-art in short-term (9s) traffic simulation, and significantly outperforms all other methods in long-term (30s) simulation. The code and model of InfGen will be released at https://orangesodahub.github.io/InfGen

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise in automating data analysis tasks, yet open-source models face significant limitations in these kinds of reasoning-intensive scenarios. In this work, we investigate strategies to enhance the data analysis capabilities of open-source LLMs. By curating a seed dataset of diverse, realistic scenarios, we evaluate model behavior across three core dimensions: data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning. Our analysis reveals three key findings: (1) Strategic planning quality serves as the primary determinant of model performance; (2) Interaction design and task complexity significantly influence reasoning capabilities; (3) Data quality demonstrates a greater impact than diversity in achieving optimal performance. We leverage these insights to develop a data synthesis methodology, demonstrating significant improvements in open-source LLMs' analytical reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex domains such as logical reasoning and experimental coding. Motivated by these advancements, numerous studies have explored the application of AI in the innovation process, particularly in the context of scientific research. These AI technologies primarily aim to develop systems that can autonomously conduct research processes across a wide range of scientific disciplines. Despite these significant strides, a comprehensive survey on AI for Research (AI4Research) remains absent, which hampers our understanding and impedes further development in this field. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive survey and offer a unified perspective on AI4Research. Specifically, the main contributions of our work are as follows: (1) Systematic taxonomy: We first introduce a systematic taxonomy to classify five mainstream tasks in AI4Research. (2) New frontiers: Then, we identify key research gaps and highlight promising future directions, focusing on the rigor and scalability of automated experiments, as well as the societal impact. (3) Abundant applications and resources: Finally, we compile a wealth of resources, including relevant multidisciplinary applications, data corpora, and tools. We hope our work will provide the research community with quick access to these resources and stimulate innovative breakthroughs in AI4Research.

<title>S2FGL: Spatial Spectral Federated Graph Learning</title>

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) combines the privacy-preserving capabilities of federated learning (FL) with the strong graph modeling capability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Current research addresses subgraph-FL from the structural perspective, neglecting the propagation of graph signals on spatial and spectral domains of the structure. From a spatial perspective, subgraph-FL introduces edge disconnections between clients, leading to disruptions in label signals and a degradation in the semantic knowledge of the global GNN. From a spectral perspective, spectral heterogeneity causes inconsistencies in signal frequencies across subgraphs, which makes local GNNs overfit the local signal propagation schemes. As a result, spectral client drift occurs, undermining global generalizability. To tackle the challenges, we propose a global knowledge repository to mitigate the challenge of poor semantic knowledge caused by label signal disruption. Furthermore, we design a frequency alignment to address spectral client drift. The combination of Spatial and Spectral strategies forms our framework S2FGL. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of S2FGL. The code is available at https://github.com/Wonder7racer/S2FGL.git.

arXiv:2507.03674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to extract structured information from unstructured sources-such as free-text documents and scientific literature-is critical for accelerating scientific discovery and knowledge synthesis. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various natural language processing tasks, including structured information extraction. However, their effectiveness often diminishes in specialized, domain-specific contexts that require nuanced understanding and expert-level domain knowledge. In addition, existing LLM-based approaches frequently exhibit poor transferability across tasks and domains, limiting their scalability and adaptability. To address these challenges, we introduce StructSense, a modular, task-agnostic, open-source framework for structured information extraction built on LLMs. StructSense is guided by domain-specific symbolic knowledge encoded in ontologies, enabling it to navigate complex domain content more effectively. It further incorporates agentic capabilities through self-evaluative judges that form a feedback loop for iterative refinement, and includes human-in-the-loop mechanisms to ensure quality and validation. We demonstrate that StructSense can overcome both the limitations of domain sensitivity and the lack of cross-task generalizability, as shown through its application to diverse neuroscience information extraction tasks.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.07855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that direct preference optimization (DPO) is a very specific form of a connection between two major theories in the ML context of learning from preferences: loss functions (Savage) and stochastic choice (Doignon-Falmagne and Machina). The connection is established for all of Savage's losses and at this level of generality, (i) it includes support for abstention on the choice theory side, (ii) it includes support for non-convex objectives on the ML side, and (iii) it allows to frame for free some notable extensions of the DPO setting, including margins and corrections for length. Getting to understand how DPO operates from a general principled perspective is crucial because of the huge and diverse application landscape of models, because of the current momentum around DPO, but also -- and importantly -- because many state of the art variations on DPO definitely occupy a small region of the map that we cover. It also helps to understand the pitfalls of departing from this map, and figure out workarounds.

<title>Reasoning or Memorization? Unreliable Results of Reinforcement Learning Due to Data Contamination</title>

Abstract: Reasoning in large language models has long been a central research focus, and recent studies employing reinforcement learning (RL) have introduced diverse methods that yield substantial performance gains with minimal or even no external supervision. Surprisingly, some studies even suggest that random or incorrect reward signals can enhance performance. However, these breakthroughs are predominantly observed for the mathematically strong Qwen2.5 series on benchmarks such as MATH-500, AMC, and AIME, and seldom transfer to models like Llama, which warrants a more in-depth investigation. In this work, our empirical analysis reveals that pre-training on massive web-scale corpora leaves Qwen2.5 susceptible to data contamination in widely used benchmarks. Consequently, conclusions derived from contaminated benchmarks on Qwen2.5 series may be unreliable. To obtain trustworthy evaluation results, we introduce a generator that creates fully clean arithmetic problems of arbitrary length and difficulty, dubbed RandomCalculation. Using this leakage-free dataset, we show that only accurate reward signals yield steady improvements that surpass the base model's performance boundary in mathematical reasoning, whereas random or incorrect rewards do not. Moreover, we conduct more fine-grained analyses to elucidate the factors underlying the different performance observed on the MATH-500 and RandomCalculation benchmarks. Consequently, we recommend that future studies evaluate models on uncontaminated benchmarks and, when feasible, test various model series to ensure trustworthy conclusions about RL and related methods.

arXiv:2507.10583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we compile $\textbf{$\texttt{DroidCollection}$}$, the most extensive open data suite for training and evaluating machine-generated code detectors, comprising over a million code samples, seven programming languages, outputs from 43 coding models, and over three real-world coding domains. Alongside fully AI-generated samples, our collection includes human-AI co-authored code, as well as adversarial samples explicitly crafted to evade detection. Subsequently, we develop $\textbf{$\texttt{DroidDetect}$}$, a suite of encoder-only detectors trained using a multi-task objective over $\texttt{DroidCollection}$. Our experiments show that existing detectors' performance fails to generalise to diverse coding domains and programming languages outside of their narrow training data. Additionally, we demonstrate that while most detectors are easily compromised by humanising the output distributions using superficial prompting and alignment approaches, this problem can be easily amended by training on a small amount of adversarial data. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of metric learning and uncertainty-based resampling as means to enhance detector training on possibly noisy distributions.

<title>Divide-Then-Rule: A Cluster-Driven Hierarchical Interpolator for Attribute-Missing Graphs</title>

Abstract: Deep graph clustering (DGC) for attribute-missing graphs is an unsupervised task aimed at partitioning nodes with incomplete attributes into distinct clusters. Addressing this challenging issue is vital for practical applications. However, research in this area remains underexplored. Existing imputation methods for attribute-missing graphs often fail to account for the varying amounts of information available across node neighborhoods, leading to unreliable results, especially for nodes with insufficient known neighborhood. To address this issue, we propose a novel method named Divide-Then-Rule Graph Completion (DTRGC). This method first addresses nodes with sufficient known neighborhood information and treats the imputed results as new knowledge to iteratively impute more challenging nodes, while leveraging clustering information to correct imputation errors. Specifically, Dynamic Cluster-Aware Feature Propagation (DCFP) initializes missing node attributes by adjusting propagation weights based on the clustering structure. Subsequently, Hierarchical Neighborhood-aware Imputation (HNAI) categorizes attribute-missing nodes into three groups based on the completeness of their neighborhood attributes. The imputation is performed hierarchically, prioritizing the groups with nodes that have the most available neighborhood information. The cluster structure is then used to refine the imputation and correct potential errors. Finally, Hop-wise Representation Enhancement (HRE) integrates information across multiple hops, thereby enriching the expressiveness of node representations. Experimental results on six widely used graph datasets show that DTRGC significantly improves the clustering performance of various DGC methods under attribute-missing graphs.

Abstract: Existing post-hoc model-agnostic methods generate external explanations for opaque models, primarily by locally attributing the model output to its input features. However, they often lack an explicit and systematic framework for quantifying the contribution of individual features. Building on the Taylor expansion framework introduced by Deng et al. (2024) to unify existing local attribution methods, we propose a rigorous set of postulates -- "precision", "federation", and "zero-discrepancy" -- to govern Taylor term-specific attribution. Guided by these postulates, we introduce TaylorPODA (Taylor expansion-derived imPortance-Order aDapted Attribution), which incorporates an additional "adaptation" property. This property enables alignment with task-specific goals, especially in post-hoc settings lacking ground-truth explanations. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that TaylorPODA achieves competitive results against baseline methods, providing principled and visualization-friendly explanations. This work enhances the trustworthy deployment of opaque models by offering explanations with stronger theoretical grounding.

Abstract: Deep graph clustering (DGC), which aims to unsupervisedly separate the nodes in an attribute graph into different clusters, has seen substantial potential in various industrial scenarios like community detection and recommendation. However, the real-world attribute graphs, e.g., social networks interactions, are usually large-scale and attribute-missing. To solve these two problems, we propose a novel DGC method termed \underline{\textbf{C}}omplementary \underline{\textbf{M}}ulti-\underline{\textbf{V}}iew \underline{\textbf{N}}eighborhood \underline{\textbf{D}}ifferentiation (\textit{CMV-ND}), which preprocesses graph structural information into multiple views in a complete but non-redundant manner. First, to ensure completeness of the structural information, we propose a recursive neighborhood search that recursively explores the local structure of the graph by completely expanding node neighborhoods across different hop distances. Second, to eliminate the redundancy between neighborhoods at different hops, we introduce a neighborhood differential strategy that ensures no overlapping nodes between the differential hop representations. Then, we construct $K+1$ complementary views from the $K$ differential hop representations and the features of the target node. Last, we apply existing multi-view clustering or DGC methods to the views. Experimental results on six widely used graph datasets demonstrate that CMV-ND significantly improves the performance of various methods.

Abstract: The proliferation of multimodal Large Language Models has significantly advanced the ability to analyze and understand complex data inputs from different modalities. However, the processing of long documents remains under-explored, largely due to a lack of suitable benchmarks. To address this, we introduce Document Haystack, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on long, visually complex documents. Document Haystack features documents ranging from 5 to 200 pages and strategically inserts pure text or multimodal text+image "needles" at various depths within the documents to challenge VLMs' retrieval capabilities. Comprising 400 document variants and a total of 8,250 questions, it is supported by an objective, automated evaluation framework. We detail the construction and characteristics of the Document Haystack dataset, present results from prominent VLMs and discuss potential research avenues in this area.

arXiv:2507.17228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Split Learning (SL) is an emerging privacy-preserving machine learning technique that enables resource constrained edge devices to participate in model training by partitioning a model into client-side and server-side sub-models. While SL reduces computational overhead on edge devices, it encounters significant challenges in heterogeneous environments where devices vary in computing resources, communication capabilities, environmental conditions, and privacy requirements. Although recent studies have explored heterogeneous SL frameworks that optimize split points for devices with varying resource constraints, they often neglect personalized privacy requirements and local model customization under varying environmental conditions. To address these limitations, we propose P3SL, a Personalized Privacy-Preserving Split Learning framework designed for heterogeneous, resource-constrained edge device systems. The key contributions of this work are twofold. First, we design a personalized sequential split learning pipeline that allows each client to achieve customized privacy protection and maintain personalized local models tailored to their computational resources, environmental conditions, and privacy needs. Second, we adopt a bi-level optimization technique that empowers clients to determine their own optimal personalized split points without sharing private sensitive information (i.e., computational resources, environmental conditions, privacy requirements) with the server. This approach balances energy consumption and privacy leakage risks while maintaining high model accuracy. We implement and evaluate P3SL on a testbed consisting of 7 devices including 4 Jetson Nano P3450 devices, 2 Raspberry Pis, and 1 laptop, using diverse model architectures and datasets under varying environmental conditions.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the problem-solving capabilities of large language models by encouraging step-by-step intermediate reasoning during inference. While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead due to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences. Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low, and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to generate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's confidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback and selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency and answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible with standard decoding pipelines. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that R-Stitch achieves up to 85\% reduction in inference latency with negligible accuracy drop, highlighting its practical effectiveness in accelerating CoT reasoning.

Abstract: Robustness and resource-efficiency are two highly desirable properties for modern machine learning models. However, achieving them jointly remains a challenge. In this paper, we identify high learning rates as a facilitator for simultaneously achieving robustness to spurious correlations and network compressibility. We demonstrate that large learning rates also produce desirable representation properties such as invariant feature utilization, class separation, and activation sparsity. Our findings indicate that large learning rates compare favorably to other hyperparameters and regularization methods, in consistently satisfying these properties in tandem. In addition to demonstrating the positive effect of large learning rates across diverse spurious correlation datasets, models, and optimizers, we also present strong evidence that the previously documented success of large learning rates in standard classification tasks is related to addressing hidden/rare spurious correlations in the training dataset. Our investigation of the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon reveals the importance of confident mispredictions of bias-conflicting samples under large learning rates.

arXiv:2507.18219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is a distributed learning paradigm that enables collaborative training over large-scale subgraphs located on multiple local systems. However, most existing FGL approaches rely on synchronous communication, which leads to inefficiencies and is often impractical in real-world deployments. Meanwhile, current asynchronous federated learning (AFL) methods are primarily designed for conventional tasks such as image classification and natural language processing, without accounting for the unique topological properties of graph data. Directly applying these methods to graph learning can possibly result in semantic drift and representational inconsistency in the global model. To address these challenges, we propose FedSA-GCL, a semi-asynchronous federated framework that leverages both inter-client label distribution divergence and graph topological characteristics through a novel ClusterCast mechanism for efficient training. We evaluate FedSA-GCL on multiple real-world graph datasets using the Louvain and Metis split algorithms, and compare it against 9 baselines. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves strong robustness and outstanding efficiency, outperforming the baselines by an average of 2.92% with the Louvain and by 3.4% with the Metis.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) delineation, the segmentation of meaningful waveform features, is critical for clinical diagnosis. Despite recent advances using deep learning, progress has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available annotated datasets. Semi-supervised learning presents a promising solution by leveraging abundant unlabeled ECG data. In this study, we present SemiSegECG, the first systematic benchmark for semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SemiSeg) in ECG delineation. We curated and unified multiple public datasets, including previously underused sources, to support robust and diverse evaluation. We adopted five representative SemiSeg algorithms from computer vision, implemented them on two different architectures: the convolutional network and the transformer, and evaluated them in two different settings: in-domain and cross-domain. Additionally, we propose ECG-specific training configurations and augmentation strategies and introduce a standardized evaluation framework. Our results show that the transformer outperforms the convolutional network in semi-supervised ECG delineation. We anticipate that SemiSegECG will serve as a foundation for advancing semi-supervised ECG delineation methods and will facilitate further research in this domain.

Abstract: We propose a new volumetric grasp model that is equivariant to rotations around the vertical axis, leading to a significant improvement in sample efficiency. Our model employs a tri-plane volumetric feature representation -- i.e., the projection of 3D features onto three canonical planes. We introduce a novel tri-plane feature design in which features on the horizontal plane are equivariant to 90{\deg} rotations, while the sum of features from the other two planes remains invariant to the same transformations. This design is enabled by a new deformable steerable convolution, which combines the adaptability of deformable convolutions with the rotational equivariance of steerable ones. This allows the receptive field to adapt to local object geometry while preserving equivariance properties. We further develop equivariant adaptations of two state-of-the-art volumetric grasp planners, GIGA and IGD. Specifically, we derive a new equivariant formulation of IGD's deformable attention mechanism and propose an equivariant generative model of grasp orientations based on flow matching. We provide a detailed analytical justification of the proposed equivariance properties and validate our approach through extensive simulated and real-world experiments. Our results demonstrate that the proposed projection-based design significantly reduces both computational and memory costs. Moreover, the equivariant grasp models built on top of our tri-plane features consistently outperform their non-equivariant counterparts, achieving higher performance with only a modest computational overhead.

Abstract: Hateful memes aimed at LGBTQ\,+ communities often evade detection by tweaking either the caption, the image, or both. We build the first robustness benchmark for this setting, pairing four realistic caption attacks with three canonical image corruptions and testing all combinations on the PrideMM dataset. Two state-of-the-art detectors, MemeCLIP and MemeBLIP2, serve as case studies, and we introduce a lightweight \textbf{Text Denoising Adapter (TDA)} to enhance the latter's resilience. Across the grid, MemeCLIP degrades more gently, while MemeBLIP2 is particularly sensitive to the caption edits that disrupt its language processing. However, the addition of the TDA not only remedies this weakness but makes MemeBLIP2 the most robust model overall. Ablations reveal that all systems lean heavily on text, but architectural choices and pre-training data significantly impact robustness. Our benchmark exposes where current multimodal safety models crack and demonstrates that targeted, lightweight modules like the TDA offer a powerful path towards stronger defences.

Summary: <br>
Large language models have shown impressive reasoning abilities in tasks like mathematics and coding, yet they lack true comprehension of their reasoning processes. This paper explores how self-play can enhance model rationality in reasoning without human supervision. The proposed Critic-Discernment Game involves a prover providing solutions to problems and facing critiques that assist or mislead. The prover must maintain the correct answer in the presence of misleading comments and correct errors based on constructive feedback. Experiments demonstrate that CDG training significantly improves the ability of well-aligned LLMs to comprehend their reasoning process. The tasks tested include mathematical reasoning, error detection, self-correction, and long-chain reasoning. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable reasoning abilities in various tasks such as mathematics and coding. However, recent studies indicate that even the best models lack true comprehension of their reasoning processes. In this paper, we explore how self-play can enhance the rationality of models in the reasoning process without supervision from humans or superior models. We design a Critic-Discernment Game(CDG) in which a prover first provides a solution to a given problem and is subsequently challenged by critiques of its solution. These critiques either aim to assist or mislead the prover. The objective of the prover is to maintain the correct answer when faced with misleading comments, while correcting errors in response to constructive feedback. Our experiments on tasks involving mathematical reasoning, stepwise error detection, self-correction, and long-chain reasoning demonstrate that CDG training can significantly improve the ability of well-aligned LLMs to comprehend their reasoning process.

Abstract: Deploying a Machine Learning (ML) training pipeline into production requires good software engineering practices. Unfortunately, the typical data science workflow often leads to code that lacks critical software quality attributes. This experience report investigates this problem in SPIRA, a project whose goal is to create an ML-Enabled System (MLES) to pre-diagnose insufficiency respiratory via speech analysis. This paper presents an overview of the architecture of the MLES, then compares three versions of its Continuous Training subsystem: from a proof of concept Big Ball of Mud (v1), to a design pattern-based Modular Monolith (v2), to a test-driven set of Microservices (v3) Each version improved its overall extensibility, maintainability, robustness, and resiliency. The paper shares challenges and lessons learned in this process, offering insights for researchers and practitioners seeking to productionize their pipelines.

Summary:<br>
This article provides a systematic survey of Discrete Diffusion Language Models (dLLMs) and Discrete Diffusion Multimodal Language Models (dMLLMs), which differ from autoregressive models by using a multi-token, parallel decoding paradigm with full attention and a denoising-based generation strategy. This approach enables parallel generation, fine-grained output controllability, and dynamic, response-aware perception. The research in this domain has been driven by advancements in autoregressive models and the mathematical models underlying discrete diffusion. The article traces the historical development of dLLMs and dMLLMs, formalizes the mathematical frameworks, categorizes representative models, analyzes key techniques for training and inference, and summarizes emerging applications across language, vision-language, and biological domains. Future directions for research and deployment are discussed as well. <div>

Abstract: In this work, we provide a systematic survey of Discrete Diffusion Language Models (dLLMs) and Discrete Diffusion Multimodal Language Models (dMLLMs). Unlike autoregressive (AR) models, dLLMs and dMLLMs adopt a multi-token, parallel decoding paradigm using full attention and a denoising-based generation strategy. This paradigm naturally enables parallel generation, fine-grained output controllability, and dynamic, response-aware perception. These capabilities are previously difficult to achieve with AR models. Recently, a growing number of industrial-scale proprietary d(M)LLMs, as well as a large number of open-source academic d(M)LLMs, have demonstrated performance comparable to their autoregressive counterparts, while achieving up to 10x acceleration in inference speed.
  The advancement of discrete diffusion LLMs and MLLMs has been largely driven by progress in two domains. The first is the development of autoregressive LLMs and MLLMs, which has accumulated vast amounts of data, benchmarks, and foundational infrastructure for training and inference. The second contributing domain is the evolution of the mathematical models underlying discrete diffusion. Together, these advancements have catalyzed a surge in dLLMs and dMLLMs research in early 2025.
  In this work, we present a comprehensive overview of the research in the dLLM and dMLLM domains. We trace the historical development of dLLMs and dMLLMs, formalize the underlying mathematical frameworks, and categorize representative models. We further analyze key techniques for training and inference, and summarize emerging applications across language, vision-language, and biological domains. We conclude by discussing future directions for research and deployment.

Abstract: Large language models are thought to have potential to aid in medical decision making. We investigate this here. We start with the treatment problem, the patient's core medical decision-making task, which is solved in collaboration with a healthcare provider. We discuss approaches to solving the treatment problem, including -- within evidence-based medicine -- trials and observational data. We then discuss the chat problem, and how this differs from the treatment problem -- in particular as it relates to imitation. We then discuss how a large language model might be used to solve the treatment problem and highlight some of the challenges that emerge. We finally discuss how these challenges relate to evidence-based medicine, and how this might inform next steps.

<div> Keywords: multi-organ segmentation, cross-modal interaction, semantic prompting, medical imaging, deep learning

Summary:<br>
The article introduces CRISP-SAM2, a novel model for multi-organ medical segmentation that addresses key challenges in the field. The model utilizes a progressive cross-attention interaction mechanism to incorporate textual descriptions of organs into the segmentation process, enhancing detailed understanding of visual information. By employing a semantic prompting strategy and a similarity-sorting self-updating strategy for memory, CRISP-SAM2 reduces reliance on geometric prompts and improves localization of details. The model outperforms existing models on seven public datasets, demonstrating superior performance in accurate segmentation while retaining spatial information. The code for CRISP-SAM2 is available on GitHub, providing a valuable tool for medical image processing research. <div>

Abstract: Multi-organ medical segmentation is a crucial component of medical image processing, essential for doctors to make accurate diagnoses and develop effective treatment plans. Despite significant progress in this field, current multi-organ segmentation models often suffer from inaccurate details, dependence on geometric prompts and loss of spatial information. Addressing these challenges, we introduce a novel model named CRISP-SAM2 with CRoss-modal Interaction and Semantic Prompting based on SAM2. This model represents a promising approach to multi-organ medical segmentation guided by textual descriptions of organs. Our method begins by converting visual and textual inputs into cross-modal contextualized semantics using a progressive cross-attention interaction mechanism. These semantics are then injected into the image encoder to enhance the detailed understanding of visual information. To eliminate reliance on geometric prompts, we use a semantic prompting strategy, replacing the original prompt encoder to sharpen the perception of challenging targets. In addition, a similarity-sorting self-updating strategy for memory and a mask-refining process is applied to further adapt to medical imaging and enhance localized details. Comparative experiments conducted on seven public datasets indicate that CRISP-SAM2 outperforms existing models. Extensive analysis also demonstrates the effectiveness of our method, thereby confirming its superior performance, especially in addressing the limitations mentioned earlier. Our code is available at: https://github.com/YU-deep/CRISP_SAM2.git.

<div> Keywords: Random Forest, ensemble learning, informative features, maximal diversity, refined classifier

Summary:
In this work, a Refined Random Forest Classifier is proposed to address the issues of high inference cost and model redundancy associated with traditional Random Forest (RF) models. The refined classifier dynamically grows trees only on informative features and maximizes diversity by clustering and retaining uncorrelated trees. It iteratively refines itself by removing the least informative features and determining the optimal number of new trees to grow. Correlation-based clustering is then used to eliminate redundant trees. Experimental results on various datasets show that the proposed model outperforms standard RF in terms of classification accuracy. This refined approach to building random forests offers improved performance while reducing redundancy and inference cost. <br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.00467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random Forest (RF) is a widely used ensemble learning technique known for its robust classification performance across diverse domains. However, it often relies on hundreds of trees and all input features, leading to high inference cost and model redundancy. In this work, our goal is to grow trees dynamically only on informative features and then enforce maximal diversity by clustering and retaining uncorrelated trees. Therefore, we propose a Refined Random Forest Classifier that iteratively refines itself by first removing the least informative features and then analytically determines how many new trees should be grown, followed by correlation-based clustering to remove redundant trees. The classification accuracy of our model was compared against the standard RF on the same number of trees. Experiments on 8 multiple benchmark datasets, including binary and multiclass datasets, demonstrate that the proposed model achieves improved accuracy compared to standard RF.

<div> Keywords: object recognition, local texture cues, configural shape score, convolutional models, transformer models

Summary:
Humans recognize objects using both local texture cues and global part configurations, but current vision models focus mainly on local texture cues, leading to rigid features. The Configural Shape Score (CSS) measures the ability to recognize objects in different configurations while preserving local texture, with self-supervised transformers like DINOv2 and SigLIP2 performing well. High-CSS networks rely on long-range interactions and exhibit a transition from local to global coding. Border-hacking strategies are ruled out through control experiments with BagNet. The CSS also predicts other shape-dependent evaluations. The study suggests that the key to robust and human-like vision systems lies in seamlessly integrating both local texture and global configural shape cues in the architectural and learning frameworks. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.00493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans are able to recognize objects based on both local texture cues and the configuration of object parts, yet contemporary vision models primarily harvest local texture cues, yielding brittle, non-compositional features. Work on shape-vs-texture bias has pitted shape and texture representations in opposition, measuring shape relative to texture, ignoring the possibility that models (and humans) can simultaneously rely on both types of cues, and obscuring the absolute quality of both types of representation. We therefore recast shape evaluation as a matter of absolute configural competence, operationalized by the Configural Shape Score (CSS), which (i) measures the ability to recognize both images in Object-Anagram pairs that preserve local texture while permuting global part arrangement to depict different object categories. Across 86 convolutional, transformer, and hybrid models, CSS (ii) uncovers a broad spectrum of configural sensitivity with fully self-supervised and language-aligned transformers -- exemplified by DINOv2, SigLIP2 and EVA-CLIP -- occupying the top end of the CSS spectrum. Mechanistic probes reveal that (iii) high-CSS networks depend on long-range interactions: radius-controlled attention masks abolish performance showing a distinctive U-shaped integration profile, and representational-similarity analyses expose a mid-depth transition from local to global coding. A BagNet control remains at chance (iv), ruling out "border-hacking" strategies. Finally, (v) we show that configural shape score also predicts other shape-dependent evals. Overall, we propose that the path toward truly robust, generalizable, and human-like vision systems may not lie in forcing an artificial choice between shape and texture, but rather in architectural and learning frameworks that seamlessly integrate both local-texture and global configural shape.

Summary:  
Correctness is crucial in dynamic environments where autonomous AI agents delegate work to sub-agents. Traditional methods of assuring correctness through upfront specifications or central oversight are not effective. This article proposes a protocol that enforces correctness through collateralized claims in a recursive verification game. Tasks are published as intents, and solvers compete to fulfill them. The selected solvers carry out tasks under risk, with correctness verified post hoc by verifiers. Challengers can stake against incorrect results to trigger the verification process. Incorrect agents are penalized and correct opposition is rewarded, aligning incentives across solvers, challengers, and verifiers. Falsification conditions ensure that correctness is the Nash equilibrium in this protocol. <br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Correctness is an emergent property of systems where exposing error is cheaper than committing it. In dynamic, low-trust environments, autonomous AI agents benefit from delegating work to sub-agents, yet correctness cannot be assured through upfront specification or centralized oversight. We propose a protocol that enforces correctness through collateralized claims in a recursive verification game. Tasks are published as intents, and solvers compete to fulfill them. Selected solvers carry out tasks under risk, with correctness checked post hoc by verifiers. Any challenger can challenge a result by staking against it to trigger the verification process. Incorrect agents are slashed and correct opposition is rewarded, with an escalation path that penalizes erroneous verifiers themselves. When incentives are aligned across solvers, challengers, and verifiers, falsification conditions make correctness the Nash equilibrium.

Abstract: Unified image restoration is a significantly challenging task in low-level vision. Existing methods either make tailored designs for specific tasks, limiting their generalizability across various types of degradation, or rely on training with paired datasets, thereby suffering from closed-set constraints. To address these issues, we propose a novel, dataset-free, and unified approach through recurrent posterior sampling utilizing a pretrained latent diffusion model. Our method incorporates the multimodal understanding model to provide sematic priors for the generative model under a task-blind condition. Furthermore, it utilizes a lightweight module to align the degraded input with the generated preference of the diffusion model, and employs recurrent refinement for posterior sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness and robustness.

<br>
Summary:<br>
Robots Imitating Generated Videos (RIGVid) is a system that enables robots to perform complex manipulation tasks by imitating AI-generated videos, without physical demonstrations or robot-specific training. The system utilizes a video diffusion model to generate demonstration videos based on a language command and an initial scene image. A vision-language model filters out videos that do not follow the command, and a 6D pose tracker extracts object trajectories from the videos. These trajectories are then retargeted to the robot in an embodiment-agnostic manner. Real-world evaluations demonstrate that generated videos are as effective as real demonstrations and that performance improves with generation quality. Using generated videos outperforms other methods such as keypoint prediction with VLMs, and strong 6D pose tracking is found to be the most effective way to extract trajectories for robotic manipulation tasks. The study suggests that state-of-the-art AI-generated videos can provide effective supervision for robots.

Abstract: This work introduces Robots Imitating Generated Videos (RIGVid), a system that enables robots to perform complex manipulation tasks--such as pouring, wiping, and mixing--purely by imitating AI-generated videos, without requiring any physical demonstrations or robot-specific training. Given a language command and an initial scene image, a video diffusion model generates potential demonstration videos, and a vision-language model (VLM) automatically filters out results that do not follow the command. A 6D pose tracker then extracts object trajectories from the video, and the trajectories are retargeted to the robot in an embodiment-agnostic fashion. Through extensive real-world evaluations, we show that filtered generated videos are as effective as real demonstrations, and that performance improves with generation quality. We also show that relying on generated videos outperforms more compact alternatives such as keypoint prediction using VLMs, and that strong 6D pose tracking outperforms other ways to extract trajectories, such as dense feature point tracking. These findings suggest that videos produced by a state-of-the-art off-the-shelf model can offer an effective source of supervision for robotic manipulation.

<div> Keywords: System Instructions, Large Language Models, SI-Agent, automated generation, human-readable

Summary:
SI-Agent is a new framework designed to automatically generate and improve human-readable System Instructions for Large Language Models (LLMs). It consists of three agents working together: an Instructor Agent, an Instruction Follower Agent (LLM), and a Feedback/Reward Agent. Through iterative cycles guided by feedback, the Instructor Agent refines the instructions to improve task performance and readability. Experimental results show that SI-Agent effectively generates readable SIs, striking a balance between performance and interpretability compared to existing methods. This framework has the potential to democratize LLM customization and enhance model transparency. However, challenges such as computational cost and feedback reliability need to be considered. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: System Instructions (SIs), or system prompts, are pivotal for guiding Large Language Models (LLMs) but manual crafting is resource-intensive and often suboptimal. Existing automated methods frequently generate non-human-readable "soft prompts," sacrificing interpretability. This paper introduces SI-Agent, a novel agentic framework designed to automatically generate and iteratively refine human-readable SIs through a feedback-driven loop. SI-Agent employs three collaborating agents: an Instructor Agent, an Instruction Follower Agent (target LLM), and a Feedback/Reward Agent evaluating task performance and optionally SI readability. The framework utilizes iterative cycles where feedback guides the Instructor's refinement strategy (e.g., LLM-based editing, evolutionary algorithms). We detail the framework's architecture, agent roles, the iterative refinement process, and contrast it with existing methods. We present experimental results validating SI-Agent's effectiveness, focusing on metrics for task performance, SI readability, and efficiency. Our findings indicate that SI-Agent generates effective, readable SIs, offering a favorable trade-off between performance and interpretability compared to baselines. Potential implications include democratizing LLM customization and enhancing model transparency. Challenges related to computational cost and feedback reliability are acknowledged.

Abstract: We propose a scalable and cost-efficient framework for deploying Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) in enterprise environments. While GraphRAG has shown promise for multi-hop reasoning and structured retrieval, its adoption has been limited by the high computational cost of constructing knowledge graphs using large language models (LLMs) and the latency of graph-based retrieval. To address these challenges, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a dependency-based knowledge graph construction pipeline that leverages industrial-grade NLP libraries to extract entities and relations from unstructured text completely eliminating reliance on LLMs; and (2) a lightweight graph retrieval strategy that combines hybrid query node identification with efficient one-hop traversal for high-recall, low-latency subgraph extraction. We evaluate our framework on two SAP datasets focused on legacy code migration and demonstrate strong empirical performance. Our system achieves up to 15% and 4.35% improvements over traditional RAG baselines based on LLM-as-Judge and RAGAS metrics, respectively. Moreover, our dependency-based construction approach attains 94% of the performance of LLM-generated knowledge graphs (61.87% vs. 65.83%) while significantly reducing cost and improving scalability. These results validate the feasibility of deploying GraphRAG systems in real-world, large-scale enterprise applications without incurring prohibitive resource requirements paving the way for practical, explainable, and domain-adaptable retrieval-augmented reasoning.

Abstract: Effective prompt design is essential for improving the planning capabilities of large language model (LLM)-driven agents. However, existing structured prompting strategies are typically limited to single-agent, plan-only settings, and often evaluate performance solely based on task accuracy - overlooking critical factors such as token efficiency, modularity, and scalability in multi-agent environments. To address these limitations, we introduce CodeAgents, a prompting framework that codifies multi-agent reasoning and enables structured, token-efficient planning in multi-agent systems. In CodeAgents, all components of agent interaction - Task, Plan, Feedback, system roles, and external tool invocations - are codified into modular pseudocode enriched with control structures (e.g., loops, conditionals), boolean logic, and typed variables. This design transforms loosely connected agent plans into cohesive, interpretable, and verifiable multi-agent reasoning programs. We evaluate the proposed framework across three diverse benchmarks - GAIA, HotpotQA, and VirtualHome - using a range of representative LLMs. Results show consistent improvements in planning performance, with absolute gains of 3-36 percentage points over natural language prompting baselines. On VirtualHome, our method achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 56%. In addition, our approach reduces input and output token usage by 55-87% and 41-70%, respectively, underscoring the importance of token-aware evaluation metrics in the development of scalable multi-agent LLM systems.

<div> Keywords: DyTAGs, Generative DyTAG Benchmark (GDGB), Transductive Dynamic Graph Generation (TDGG), Inductive Dynamic Graph Generation (IDGG), LLM-based multi-agent generative framework

Summary:
The article introduces the concept of Dynamic Text-Attributed Graphs (DyTAGs) and highlights the importance of integrating structural, temporal, and textual attributes for modeling complex real-world systems. It addresses the limitations of existing DyTAG datasets by proposing the Generative DyTAG Benchmark (GDGB), which includes eight high-quality DyTAG datasets with rich textual features. Two novel DyTAG generation tasks, Transductive Dynamic Graph Generation (TDGG) and Inductive Dynamic Graph Generation (IDGG), are defined to generate target DyTAGs based on specific criteria. Multifaceted metrics are designed to evaluate the quality of the generated DyTAGs, considering structural, temporal, and textual aspects. The article also introduces the GAG-General framework, an LLM-based multi-agent generative framework for benchmarking DyTAG generation. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of GDGB in advancing generative DyTAG research and unlocking practical applications in DyTAG generation. The datasets, source codes, and leaderboards for GDGB are made available for further exploration and research.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Dynamic Text-Attributed Graphs (DyTAGs), which intricately integrate structural, temporal, and textual attributes, are crucial for modeling complex real-world systems. However, most of the existing DyTAG datasets exhibit poor textual quality, which severely limits their utility for DyTAG generation tasks requiring semantically rich inputs. Additionally, prior work mainly focuses on discriminative tasks on DyTAGs, resulting in a lack of standardized task formulations and evaluation protocols tailored for DyTAG generation. To address these critical issues, we propose Generative DyTAG Benchmark (GDGB), which comprises eight meticulously curated DyTAG datasets with high-quality textual features for both nodes and edges, overcoming limitations of prior datasets. Building on GDGB, we define two novel DyTAG generation tasks: Transductive Dynamic Graph Generation (TDGG) and Inductive Dynamic Graph Generation (IDGG). TDGG transductively generates a target DyTAG based on the given source and destination node sets, while the more challenging IDGG introduces new node generation to inductively model the dynamic expansion of real-world graph data. To enable holistic evaluation, we design multifaceted metrics that assess the structural, temporal, and textual quality of the generated DyTAGs. We further propose GAG-General, an LLM-based multi-agent generative framework tailored for reproducible and robust benchmarking of DyTAG generation. Experimental results demonstrate that GDGB enables rigorous evaluation of TDGG and IDGG, with key insights revealing the critical interplay of structural and textual features in DyTAG generation. These findings establish GDGB as a foundational resource for advancing generative DyTAG research and unlocking further practical applications in DyTAG generation. GDGB datasets, source codes, and leaderboards are available at \href{https://gdgb-algo.github.io/}{here}.

Keywords: Memory Mosaics, associative memories, large language models, training-knowledge storage, in-context learning

Summary:
Memory Mosaics v2, scaled to 10B size, outperform transformers on new-knowledge storage and in-context learning. They match transformers on training-knowledge storage. Architectural modifications enhance performance. Memory Mosaics v2 trained on one trillion tokens outperform transformers trained on eight trillion tokens. These improvements are not solely due to increased training data. Memory Mosaics exhibit strengths in carrying out new tasks at inference time, highlighting their potential for real-world applications. <div>
arXiv:2507.03285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memory Mosaics [Zhang et al., 2025], networks of associative memories, have demonstrated appealing compositional and in-context learning capabilities on medium-scale networks (GPT-2 scale) and synthetic small datasets. This work shows that these favorable properties remain when we scale memory mosaics to large language model sizes (llama-8B scale) and real-world datasets.
  To this end, we scale memory mosaics to 10B size, we train them on one trillion tokens, we introduce a couple architectural modifications ("Memory Mosaics v2"), we assess their capabilities across three evaluation dimensions: training-knowledge storage, new-knowledge storage, and in-context learning.
  Throughout the evaluation, memory mosaics v2 match transformers on the learning of training knowledge (first dimension) and significantly outperforms transformers on carrying out new tasks at inference time (second and third dimensions). These improvements cannot be easily replicated by simply increasing the training data for transformers. A memory mosaics v2 trained on one trillion tokens still perform better on these tasks than a transformer trained on eight trillion tokens.

<div> large language models, modular architecture, actor-critic, linear temporal logic, Minecraft

Summary:
The article introduces a modular actor-critic architecture for enhancing the decision-making capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in long-term planning tasks. The proposed architecture combines an LLM actor with LTLCrit, a trajectory-level LLM critic that communicates through linear temporal logic (LTL). The actor makes high-level action selections based on natural language input, while the critic analyzes full trajectories and suggests new LTL constraints to prevent unsafe or inefficient behavior in the future. This setup supports both fixed safety constraints and adaptive soft constraints for promoting long-term efficiency. The system is model-agnostic, allowing different LLM-based planners to serve as the actor. Formalizing planning as graph traversal under symbolic constraints enables the critic to generate new logic rules based on analyzing failed or suboptimal trajectories. Evaluation on the Minecraft diamond-mining benchmark shows improved efficiency and 100% completion rates compared to baseline LLM planners. The results demonstrate the potential of using logic to enable LLMs to supervise each other for safe and generalizable decision-making.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.03293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in reasoning tasks and general decision-making in static environments. In long-term planning tasks, however, errors tend to accumulate, often leading to unsafe or inefficient behavior, limiting their use in general-purpose settings. We propose a modular actor-critic architecture in which an LLM actor is guided by LTLCrit, a trajectory-level LLM critic that communicates via linear temporal logic (LTL). Our setup combines the reasoning strengths of language models with the guarantees of formal logic. The actor selects high-level actions from natural language observations, while the critic analyzes full trajectories and proposes new LTL constraints that shield the actor from future unsafe or inefficient behavior. The architecture supports both fixed, hand-specified safety constraints and adaptive, learned soft constraints that promote long-term efficiency. Our architecture is model-agnostic: any LLM-based planner can serve as the actor, and LTLCrit serves as a logic-generating wrapper. We formalize planning as graph traversal under symbolic constraints, allowing LTLCrit to analyze failed or suboptimal trajectories and generate new temporal logic rules that improve future behavior. We evaluate our system on the Minecraft diamond-mining benchmark, achieving 100% completion rates and improving efficiency compared to baseline LLM planners. Our results suggest that enabling LLMs to supervise each other through logic is a powerful and flexible paradigm for safe, generalizable decision making.

Abstract: We present NDAI-NeuroMAP, the first neuroscience-domain-specific dense vector embedding model engineered for high-precision information retrieval tasks. Our methodology encompasses the curation of an extensive domain-specific training corpus comprising 500,000 carefully constructed triplets (query-positive-negative configurations), augmented with 250,000 neuroscience-specific definitional entries and 250,000 structured knowledge-graph triplets derived from authoritative neurological ontologies. We employ a sophisticated fine-tuning approach utilizing the FremyCompany/BioLORD-2023 foundation model, implementing a multi-objective optimization framework combining contrastive learning with triplet-based metric learning paradigms. Comprehensive evaluation on a held-out test dataset comprising approximately 24,000 neuroscience-specific queries demonstrates substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art general-purpose and biomedical embedding models. These empirical findings underscore the critical importance of domain-specific embedding architectures for neuroscience-oriented RAG systems and related clinical natural language processing applications.

Summary: 
In the paper, the authors introduce OSCAR, a technical pipeline designed to enhance the cooking experience for individuals with vision impairments by leveraging object status recognition. By integrating aspects such as recipe parsing, object status extraction, visual alignment with cooking steps, and time-causal modeling, OSCAR facilitates real-time tracking of recipe progress. The study evaluated OSCAR using instructional videos and real-world data from non-visual cooking sessions, demonstrating improved step prediction accuracy with the inclusion of object status information. The analysis also highlighted factors influencing performance in practical settings, including implicit tasks, camera placement, and lighting conditions. The research contributes a context-aware recipe progress tracking pipeline, an annotated non-visual cooking dataset, and valuable design insights for the development of assistive cooking systems.

arXiv:2507.03330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooking plays a vital role in everyday independence and well-being, yet remains challenging for people with vision impairments due to limited support for tracking progress and receiving contextual feedback. Object status - the condition or transformation of ingredients and tools - offers a promising but underexplored foundation for context-aware cooking support. In this paper, we present OSCAR (Object Status Context Awareness for Recipes), a technical pipeline that explores the use of object status recognition to enable recipe progress tracking in non-visual cooking. OSCAR integrates recipe parsing, object status extraction, visual alignment with cooking steps, and time-causal modeling to support real-time step tracking. We evaluate OSCAR on 173 instructional videos and a real-world dataset of 12 non-visual cooking sessions recorded by BLV individuals in their homes. Our results show that object status consistently improves step prediction accuracy across vision-language models, and reveal key factors that impact performance in real-world conditions, such as implicit tasks, camera placement, and lighting. We contribute the pipeline of context-aware recipe progress tracking, an annotated real-world non-visual cooking dataset, and design insights to guide future context-aware assistive cooking systems.

- The pipeline focuses on disambiguation in multi-turn dialogues, supervised fine-tuning of models, and live evaluation of model readiness.
- Models trained with DiaFORGE outperform existing models by significantly improving tool-invocation success rates.
- DiaBENCH, a dynamic benchmark, is introduced to evaluate the real-world performance of models in an agentic loop.
- An open corpus of 5000 enterprise API specifications and dialogues is released to facilitate further research and the development of reliable tool-calling agents.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.03336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with invoking enterprise APIs, yet they routinely falter when near-duplicate tools vie for the same user intent or when required arguments are left underspecified. We introduce DiaFORGE (Dialogue Framework for Organic Response Generation & Evaluation), a disambiguation-centric, three-stage pipeline that (i) synthesizes persona-driven, multi-turn dialogues in which the assistant must distinguish among highly similar tools, (ii) performs supervised fine-tuning of open-source models with reasoning traces across 3B - 70B parameters, and (iii) evaluates real-world readiness via a dynamic suite that redeploys each model in a live agentic loop and reports end-to-end goal completion alongside conventional static metrics. On our dynamic benchmark DiaBENCH, models trained with DiaFORGE raise tool-invocation success by 27 pp over GPT-4o and by 49 pp over Claude-3.5-Sonnet, both under optimized prompting. To spur further research, we release an open corpus of 5000 production-grade enterprise API specifications paired with rigorously validated, disambiguation-focused dialogues, offering a practical blueprint for building reliable, enterprise-ready tool-calling agents.

Summary: <br />
The study evaluates structured and unstructured reasoning models for compound systems. iSelf-Discover, an instance-level adaptation of the Self-Discover framework, is introduced to compare structured JSON reasoning with unstructured reasoning. Results across benchmarks show a consistent advantage for unstructured reasoning, with up to an 18.90% relative performance improvement on the MATH benchmark. Zero-shot unstructured variants outperform structured counterparts, highlighting the gap even with dynamically generated structured plans. The optimal granularity of plan generation is context-dependent. These findings question the reliance on structured formats for complex problem-solving and offer insights into organizing compound systems. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.03347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The drive for predictable LLM reasoning in their integration with compound systems has popularized structured outputs, yet concerns remain about performance trade-offs compared to unconstrained natural language. At the same time, training on unconstrained Chain of Thought (CoT) traces has brought about a new class of strong reasoning models that nevertheless present novel compute budget and faithfulness challenges. This paper introduces iSelf-Discover, an instance-level adaptation of the Self-Discover framework, and using it compares dynamically generated structured JSON reasoning with its unstructured counterpart. Our empirical evaluation across diverse benchmarks using state-of-the-art open-source models supports a consistent advantage for unstructured reasoning. Notably, on the complex MATH benchmark, unstructured plans achieved relative performance improvements of up to 18.90\% over structured approaches. Zero-shot unstructured iSelf-Discover variants are also shown to outperform their five-shot structured counterparts, underscoring the significance of this gap, even when structured plans are dynamically generated to ensure reasoning precedes the final answer. We further demonstrate that the optimal granularity of plan generation (instance-level vs. task-level) is context-dependent. These findings invite re-evaluation of the reliance on structured formats for complex problem-solving and how compound systems should be organized.

Abstract: This paper systematically reviews recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), with a particular focus on machine learning (ML), across the entire drug discovery pipeline. Due to the inherent complexity, escalating costs, prolonged timelines, and high failure rates of traditional drug discovery methods, there is a critical need to comprehensively understand how AI/ML can be effectively integrated throughout the full process. Currently available literature reviews often narrowly focus on specific phases or methodologies, neglecting the dependence between key stages such as target identification, hit screening, and lead optimization. To bridge this gap, our review provides a detailed and holistic analysis of AI/ML applications across these core phases, highlighting significant methodological advances and their impacts at each stage. We further illustrate the practical impact of these techniques through an in-depth case study focused on hyperuricemia, gout arthritis, and hyperuricemic nephropathy, highlighting real-world successes in molecular target identification and therapeutic candidate discovery. Additionally, we discuss significant challenges facing AI/ML in drug discovery and outline promising future research directions. Ultimately, this review serves as an essential orientation for researchers aiming to leverage AI/ML to overcome existing bottlenecks and accelerate drug discovery.

Summary: The article examines the possibility of current AI systems developing a capacity for scheming, similar to the historical research in the 1970s on non-human primates mastering natural language. Lessons from the past research highlight the overattribution of human traits, reliance on anecdotal evidence, and lack of a strong theoretical framework. The recommendation for AI scheming research is to avoid these pitfalls, outlining concrete steps for a productive and scientifically rigorous approach. The comparison between the past and current research practices emphasizes the importance of avoiding anthropomorphism and anecdotal analysis while establishing a solid theoretical foundation for exploring AI's potential for strategic misalignment. <div>

Abstract: We examine recent research that asks whether current AI systems may be developing a capacity for "scheming" (covertly and strategically pursuing misaligned goals). We compare current research practices in this field to those adopted in the 1970s to test whether non-human primates could master natural language. We argue that there are lessons to be learned from that historical research endeavour, which was characterised by an overattribution of human traits to other agents, an excessive reliance on anecdote and descriptive analysis, and a failure to articulate a strong theoretical framework for the research. We recommend that research into AI scheming actively seeks to avoid these pitfalls. We outline some concrete steps that can be taken for this research programme to advance in a productive and scientifically rigorous fashion.

Summary:
The study introduces a Multi-agent Exploratory Synergy for the Heart (MESHAgents) framework that utilizes large language models as agents to identify associations between imaging phenotypes and disease risk factors. The framework involves a multi-disciplinary team of AI agents spanning various fields like cardiology and statistics to analyze complex dependencies among imaging phenotypes and other data. Through iterative reasoning, the framework autonomously uncovers correlations between imaging phenotypes and non-imaging factors, going beyond standard demographic variables. Validation on diagnosis tasks shows that MESHAgents-discovered phenotypes perform comparably to expert-selected ones. The framework offers clinically relevant imaging phenotypes with transparent reasoning, providing a scalable alternative to traditional expert-driven methods. Overall, the system enhances understanding of disease mechanisms and improves diagnosis and prognosis models.

Abstract: Identifying the associations between imaging phenotypes and disease risk factors and outcomes is essential for understanding disease mechanisms and improving diagnosis and prognosis models. However, traditional approaches rely on human-driven hypothesis testing and selection of association factors, often overlooking complex, non-linear dependencies among imaging phenotypes and other multi-modal data. To address this, we introduce a Multi-agent Exploratory Synergy for the Heart (MESHAgents) framework that leverages large language models as agents to dynamically elicit, surface, and decide confounders and phenotypes in association studies, using cardiovascular imaging as a proof of concept. Specifically, we orchestrate a multi-disciplinary team of AI agents -- spanning cardiology, biomechanics, statistics, and clinical research -- which spontaneously generate and converge on insights through iterative, self-organizing reasoning. The framework dynamically synthesizes statistical correlations with multi-expert consensus, providing an automated pipeline for phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). We demonstrate the system's capabilities through a population-based study of imaging phenotypes of the heart and aorta. MESHAgents autonomously uncovered correlations between imaging phenotypes and a wide range of non-imaging factors, identifying additional confounder variables beyond standard demographic factors. Validation on diagnosis tasks reveals that MESHAgents-discovered phenotypes achieve performance comparable to expert-selected phenotypes, with mean AUC differences as small as -0.004 on disease classification tasks. Notably, the recall score improves for 6 out of 9 disease types. Our framework provides clinically relevant imaging phenotypes with transparent reasoning, offering a scalable alternative to expert-driven methods.

<div> Keywords: AI supervision, control, oversight, risk management, maturity model

Summary: 
This paper examines the differentiation between oversight and control in the context of AI systems. Control is seen as ex-ante or real-time operational measures aimed at preventing failures, while oversight focuses on detection, remediation, and incentives for future prevention. The paper proposes a framework that articulates the conditions for each mechanism, their shortcomings, and the necessary elements for practical implementation.

The paper also delves into the boundaries of these mechanisms, highlighting where they apply, fail, and where new methods are needed.

Abstract: Oversight and control (collectively, supervision) are often invoked as key levers for ensuring that AI systems are accountable, reliable, and able to fulfill governance and management requirements. However, the concepts are frequently conflated or insufficiently distinguished in academic and policy discourse, undermining efforts to design or evaluate systems that should remain under meaningful human supervision.
  This paper undertakes a targeted critical review of literature on supervision outside of AI, along with a brief summary of past work on the topic related to AI. We then differentiate control as being ex-ante or real-time, and operational rather than policy or governance. In contrast, oversight is either a policy and governance function, or is ex-post. We suggest that control aims to prevent failures. In contrast, oversight often focuses on detection, remediation, or incentives for future prevention; all preventative oversight strategies nonetheless necessitate control.
  Building on this foundation, we make three contributions. First, we propose a theoretically-informed yet policy-grounded framework that articulates the conditions under which each mechanism is possible, where they fall short, and what is required to make them meaningful in practice. Second, we outline how supervision methods should be documented and integrated into risk management, and drawing on the Microsoft Responsible AI Maturity Model, we outline a maturity model for AI supervision. Third, we explicitly highlight some boundaries of these mechanisms, including where they apply, where they fail, and where it is clear that no existing methods suffice. This foregrounds the question of whether meaningful supervision is possible in a given deployment context, and can support regulators, auditors, and practitioners in identifying both present limitations and the need for new conceptual and technical advances.

<div> assignment problems, Deep Reinforcement Learning, neural network, graph-based feature representation, Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm

Summary:<br />
This paper addresses the challenge of representing and solving assignment problems with infinite state and action spaces using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). The proposed method includes a graph-based feature representation called an assignment graph, a mapping from Colored Petri Nets to assignment graphs, and an adapted Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm. By modeling three different assignment problems with varying dimensionalities, the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in learning near-optimal task assignment policies regardless of the state and action space dimensionalities. <div>
arXiv:2507.03579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic task assignment concerns the optimal assignment of resources to tasks in a business process. Recently, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been proposed as the state of the art for solving assignment problems. DRL methods usually employ a neural network (NN) as an approximator for the policy function, which ingests the state of the process and outputs a valuation of the possible assignments. However, representing the state and the possible assignments so that they can serve as inputs and outputs for a policy NN remains an open challenge, especially when tasks or resources have features with an infinite number of possible values. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a method for representing and solving assignment problems with infinite state and action spaces. In doing so, it provides three contributions: (I) A graph-based feature representation of assignment problems, which we call assignment graph; (II) A mapping from marked Colored Petri Nets to assignment graphs; (III) An adaptation of the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm that can learn to solve assignment problems represented through assignment graphs. To evaluate the proposed representation method, we model three archetypal assignment problems ranging from finite to infinite state and action space dimensionalities. The experiments show that the method is suitable for representing and learning close-to-optimal task assignment policies regardless of the state and action space dimensionalities.

Summary:<br />
Generative AI (GenAI) has the potential to revolutionize autonomous optimization in wireless networks, particularly in the ORAN architecture. Large Language Models (LLMs) can be specialized to generate xApps and rApps using specifications from the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC). Fine-tuning LLMs for telecom tasks is resource-intensive, but Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a practical alternative through in-context learning. This study evaluates Vector RAG, GraphRAG, and Hybrid GraphRAG using ORAN specifications, focusing on performance metrics such as faithfulness, answer relevance, context relevance, and factual correctness. Results indicate that both GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG outperform traditional RAG methods, with Hybrid GraphRAG showing an 8% improvement in factual correctness and GraphRAG improving context relevance by 7%. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is expected to play a pivotal role in enabling autonomous optimization in future wireless networks. Within the ORAN architecture, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be specialized to generate xApps and rApps by leveraging specifications and API definitions from the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) platform. However, fine-tuning base LLMs for telecom-specific tasks remains expensive and resource-intensive. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a practical alternative through in-context learning, enabling domain adaptation without full retraining. While traditional RAG systems rely on vector-based retrieval, emerging variants such as GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG incorporate knowledge graphs or dual retrieval strategies to support multi-hop reasoning and improve factual grounding. Despite their promise, these methods lack systematic, metric-driven evaluations, particularly in high-stakes domains such as ORAN. In this study, we conduct a comparative evaluation of Vector RAG, GraphRAG, and Hybrid GraphRAG using ORAN specifications. We assess performance across varying question complexities using established generation metrics: faithfulness, answer relevance, context relevance, and factual correctness. Results show that both GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG outperform traditional RAG. Hybrid GraphRAG improves factual correctness by 8%, while GraphRAG improves context relevance by 7%.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for orchestrating large language models (LLMs) and specialized tools to collaboratively address complex tasks. However, existing MAS frameworks often require manual workflow configuration and lack native support for dynamic evolution and performance optimization. In addition, many MAS optimization algorithms are not integrated into a unified framework. In this paper, we present EvoAgentX, an open-source platform that automates the generation, execution, and evolutionary optimization of multi-agent workflows. EvoAgentX employs a modular architecture consisting of five core layers: the basic components, agent, workflow, evolving, and evaluation layers. Specifically, within the evolving layer, EvoAgentX integrates three MAS optimization algorithms, TextGrad, AFlow, and MIPRO, to iteratively refine agent prompts, tool configurations, and workflow topologies. We evaluate EvoAgentX on HotPotQA, MBPP, and MATH for multi-hop reasoning, code generation, and mathematical problem solving, respectively, and further assess it on real-world tasks using GAIA. Experimental results show that EvoAgentX consistently achieves significant performance improvements, including a 7.44% increase in HotPotQA F1, a 10.00% improvement in MBPP pass@1, a 10.00% gain in MATH solve accuracy, and an overall accuracy improvement of up to 20.00% on GAIA.

<div> approach, machine Theory of Mind, large language models, Bayesian inverse planning models, generative agents
Summary: 
The article proposes a hybrid approach to machine Theory of Mind (ToM) by combining large language models and Bayesian inverse planning models. This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both components to improve performance on ToM tasks, even with smaller LLMs that typically struggle with such tasks. By using LLMs to generate hypotheses and likelihood functions and Bayesian inverse planning models to compute posterior probabilities for an agent's mental states, the approach closely matches optimal results on ToM tasks and shows potential for predicting mental states on open-ended tasks. This hybrid model offers a promising direction for the development of socially intelligent generative agents. <div>

Abstract: We propose a hybrid approach to machine Theory of Mind (ToM) that uses large language models (LLMs) as a mechanism for generating hypotheses and likelihood functions with a Bayesian inverse planning model that computes posterior probabilities for an agent's likely mental states given its actions. Bayesian inverse planning models can accurately predict human reasoning on a variety of ToM tasks, but these models are constrained in their ability to scale these predictions to scenarios with a large number of possible hypotheses and actions. Conversely, LLM-based approaches have recently demonstrated promise in solving ToM benchmarks, but can exhibit brittleness and failures on reasoning tasks even when they pass otherwise structurally identical versions. By combining these two methods, this approach leverages the strengths of each component, closely matching optimal results on a task inspired by prior inverse planning models and improving performance relative to models that utilize LLMs alone or with chain-of-thought prompting, even with smaller LLMs that typically perform poorly on ToM tasks. We also exhibit the model's potential to predict mental states on open-ended tasks, offering a promising direction for future development of ToM models and the creation of socially intelligent generative agents.

<div> Keywords: Knowledge Graph, Neural Networks, Symbolic Reasoning, Neurosymbolic Reasoning, Reasoning Scenarios

Summary: 
Tunsr is a unified neurosymbolic reasoning framework proposed for Knowledge Graph (KG) reasoning. It addresses the limitations of current methods by integrating neural and symbolic reasoning approaches and catering to diverse reasoning scenarios. Tunsr introduces a consistent reasoning graph structure and uses a forward logic message-passing mechanism to update representations and attentions of nodes. It merges multiple rules and induces first-order logic (FOL) rules using the FARI algorithm. Experimental results on 19 datasets across four reasoning scenarios show the effectiveness of Tunsr in transductive, inductive, interpolation, and extrapolation tasks. The framework successfully merges neural and symbolic methods, overcomes representation gaps, and handles different knowledge structures and reasoning objectives efficiently. Tunsr provides a promising solution for enhancing KG reasoning and improving downstream applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.03697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge Graph (KG) reasoning has received significant attention in the fields of artificial intelligence and knowledge engineering, owing to its ability to autonomously deduce new knowledge and consequently enhance the availability and precision of downstream applications. However, current methods predominantly concentrate on a single form of neural or symbolic reasoning, failing to effectively integrate the inherent strengths of both approaches. Furthermore, the current prevalent methods primarily focus on addressing a single reasoning scenario, presenting limitations in meeting the diverse demands of real-world reasoning tasks. Unifying the neural and symbolic methods, as well as diverse reasoning scenarios in one model is challenging as there is a natural representation gap between symbolic rules and neural networks, and diverse scenarios exhibit distinct knowledge structures and specific reasoning objectives. To address these issues, we propose a unified neurosymbolic reasoning framework, namely Tunsr, for KG reasoning. Tunsr first introduces a consistent structure of reasoning graph that starts from the query entity and constantly expands subsequent nodes by iteratively searching posterior neighbors. Based on it, a forward logic message-passing mechanism is proposed to update both the propositional representations and attentions, as well as first-order logic (FOL) representations and attentions of each node. In this way, Tunsr conducts the transformation of merging multiple rules by merging possible relations at each step. Finally, the FARI algorithm is proposed to induce FOL rules by constantly performing attention calculations over the reasoning graph. Extensive experimental results on 19 datasets of four reasoning scenarios (transductive, inductive, interpolation, and extrapolation) demonstrate the effectiveness of Tunsr.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful artificial intelligence (AI) tools transforming how research is conducted. However, their use in research has been met with skepticism, due to concerns about hallucinations, biases and potential harms to research. These emphasize the importance of clearly understanding the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs to ensure their effective and responsible use. Here, we present a roadmap for integrating LLMs into cross-disciplinary research, where effective communication, knowledge transfer and collaboration across diverse fields are essential but often challenging. We examine the capabilities and limitations of LLMs and provide a detailed computational biology case study (on modeling HIV rebound dynamics) demonstrating how iterative interactions with an LLM (ChatGPT) can facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration and research. We argue that LLMs are best used as augmentative tools within a human-in-the-loop framework. Looking forward, we envisage that the responsible use of LLMs will enhance innovative cross-disciplinary research and substantially accelerate scientific discoveries.

Summary: <br />
The paper explores enhancing LLM-based question-answering systems through agent-based architecture to address incompleteness and ambiguity in questions. By implementing zero-shot ReAct agents, the models can classify, resolve, or answer questions, leading to improved answer quality and explainable resolutions. Results show shortened interactions with humans, enhanced answer quality, and clear resolution of question deficiencies. While there may be increased latency and additional LLM invocations, the benefits outweigh the costs except for questions with sufficient context. This suggests that agent-based approaches can leverage LLMs to develop more reliable QA systems. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.03726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many of us now treat LLMs as modern-day oracles asking it almost any kind of question. However, consulting an LLM does not have to be a single turn activity. But long multi-turn interactions can get tedious if it is simply to clarify contextual information that can be arrived at through reasoning. In this paper, we examine the use of agent-based architecture to bolster LLM-based Question-Answering systems with additional reasoning capabilities. We examine the automatic resolution of potential incompleteness or ambiguities in questions by transducers implemented using LLM-based agents. We focus on several benchmark datasets that are known to contain questions with these deficiencies to varying degrees. We equip different LLMs (GPT-3.5-Turbo and Llama-4-Scout) with agents that act as specialists in detecting and resolving deficiencies of incompleteness and ambiguity. The agents are implemented as zero-shot ReAct agents. Rather than producing an answer in a single step, the model now decides between 3 actions a) classify b) resolve c) answer. Action a) decides if the question is incomplete, ambiguous, or normal. Action b) determines if any deficiencies identified can be resolved. Action c) answers the resolved form of the question. We compare the use of LLMs with and without the use of agents with these components. Our results show benefits of agents with transducer 1) A shortening of the length of interactions with human 2) An improvement in the answer quality and 3) Explainable resolution of deficiencies in the question. On the negative side we find while it may result in additional LLM invocations and in some cases, increased latency. But on tested datasets, the benefits outweigh the costs except when questions already have sufficient context. Suggesting the agent-based approach could be a useful mechanism to harness the power of LLMs to develop more robust QA systems.

This paper explores the use of Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) to automate gameplay in the challenging action role-playing game Dark Souls. The method evolves neural networks directly from raw pixel data, eliminating the need for explicit game-state information. The Dark Souls API (DSAPI) framework is introduced, utilizing real-time computer vision to extract essential game metrics. Through NEAT, agents evolve combat strategies to defeat the initial boss, the Asylum Demon, without predefined behaviors. Experimental results show that evolved agents achieve a success rate of up to 35%, demonstrating the effectiveness of neuroevolution in complex gameplay scenarios.

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) to automate gameplay in Dark Souls, a notoriously challenging action role-playing game characterized by complex combat mechanics, dynamic environments, and high-dimensional visual inputs. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning or game playing approaches, our method evolves neural networks directly from raw pixel data, circumventing the need for explicit game-state information. To facilitate this approach, we introduce the Dark Souls API (DSAPI), a novel Python framework leveraging real-time computer vision techniques for extracting critical game metrics, including player and enemy health states. Using NEAT, agents evolve effective combat strategies for defeating the Asylum Demon, the game's initial boss, without predefined behaviors or domain-specific heuristics. Experimental results demonstrate that evolved agents achieve up to a 35% success rate, indicating the viability of neuroevolution in addressing complex, visually intricate gameplay scenarios. This work represents an interesting application of vision-based neuroevolution, highlighting its potential use in a wide range of challenging game environments lacking direct API support or well-defined state representations.

- Achieved 94.9% full-knowledge recall with self-critical feedback scores correlating with external literature scores.

Abstract: Documenting tacit knowledge in organizations can be a challenging task due to incomplete initial information, difficulty in identifying knowledgeable individuals, the interplay of formal hierarchies and informal networks, and the need to ask the right questions. To address this, we propose an agent-based framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to iteratively reconstruct dataset descriptions through interactions with employees. Modeling knowledge dissemination as a Susceptible-Infectious (SI) process with waning infectivity, we conduct 864 simulations across various synthetic company structures and different dissemination parameters. Our results show that the agent achieves 94.9% full-knowledge recall, with self-critical feedback scores strongly correlating with external literature critic scores. We analyze how each simulation parameter affects the knowledge retrieval process for the agent. In particular, we find that our approach is able to recover information without needing to access directly the only domain specialist. These findings highlight the agent's ability to navigate organizational complexity and capture fragmented knowledge that would otherwise remain inaccessible.

The article introduces the RELRaE framework, designed to translate XML data generated by robots in labs into a knowledge graph for interoperability between laboratories.

The key aspect of this framework is the accurate labeling of relationships implicit in the XML schema.

Abstract: A large volume of XML data is produced in experiments carried out by robots in laboratories. In order to support the interoperability of data between labs, there is a motivation to translate the XML data into a knowledge graph. A key stage of this process is the enrichment of the XML schema to lay the foundation of an ontology schema. To achieve this, we present the RELRaE framework, a framework that employs large language models in different stages to extract and accurately label the relationships implicitly present in the XML schema. We investigate the capability of LLMs to accurately generate these labels and then evaluate them. Our work demonstrates that LLMs can be effectively used to support the generation of relationship labels in the context of lab automation, and that they can play a valuable role within semi-automatic ontology generation frameworks more generally.

<div> economic evaluation, LLMs, accuracy-cost trade-offs, reasoning models, MATH benchmark

Summary:
In this study, the researchers propose an economic evaluation framework for comparing the performance of Language Model Models (LLMs) based on concrete use cases expressed in dollars. They quantify the trade-off of LLM performance considering the cost of mistakes, incremental latency, and abstaining from a query. The framework was applied to compare reasoning and non-reasoning models on challenging questions from the MATH benchmark. The results show that reasoning models offer better accuracy-cost trade-offs when the cost of a mistake exceeds $0.01. Additionally, single large LLMs tend to outperform cascades even when the cost of a mistake is as low as $0.1. Therefore, the findings suggest that in automating human tasks with AI models, it is more beneficial to use powerful models rather than focusing solely on minimizing deployment costs, as the economic impact of AI errors is likely to outweigh deployment costs.

Abstract: Practitioners often navigate LLM performance trade-offs by plotting Pareto frontiers of optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs. However, this approach offers no way to compare between LLMs with distinct strengths and weaknesses: for example, a cheap, error-prone model vs a pricey but accurate one. To address this gap, we propose economic evaluation of LLMs. Our framework quantifies the performance trade-off of an LLM as a single number based on the economic constraints of a concrete use case, all expressed in dollars: the cost of making a mistake, the cost of incremental latency, and the cost of abstaining from a query. We apply our economic evaluation framework to compare the performance of reasoning and non-reasoning models on difficult questions from the MATH benchmark, discovering that reasoning models offer better accuracy-cost tradeoffs as soon as the economic cost of a mistake exceeds \$0.01. In addition, we find that single large LLMs often outperform cascades when the cost of making a mistake is as low as \$0.1. Overall, our findings suggest that when automating meaningful human tasks with AI models, practitioners should typically use the most powerful available model, rather than attempt to minimize AI deployment costs, since deployment costs are likely dwarfed by the economic impact of AI errors.

Summary:
The article introduces Uni-Retrieval, a novel multi-modal retrieval module that incorporates query-style prototypes to enhance educational content interpretation. By utilizing a Prompt Bank to store domain-specific knowledge and dynamically match query styles, Uni-Retrieval can adapt to unseen query types during testing. The integration of Uni-Retrieval with a language model forms Uni-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline for natural language educational content generation. Experimental results demonstrate that Uni-RAG surpasses baseline systems in retrieval accuracy and generation quality while maintaining efficiency. The framework offers a scalable solution for intelligent educational systems by combining retrieval and generation to provide personalized, explainable, and efficient learning assistance across diverse STEM scenarios.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.03868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In AI-facilitated teaching, leveraging various query styles to interpret abstract educational content is crucial for delivering effective and accessible learning experiences. However, existing retrieval systems predominantly focus on natural text-image matching and lack the capacity to address the diversity and ambiguity inherent in real-world educational scenarios. To address this limitation, we develop a lightweight and efficient multi-modal retrieval module, named Uni-Retrieval, which extracts query-style prototypes and dynamically matches them with tokens from a continually updated Prompt Bank. This Prompt Bank encodes and stores domain-specific knowledge by leveraging a Mixture-of-Expert Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE-LoRA) module and can be adapted to enhance Uni-Retrieval's capability to accommodate unseen query types at test time. To enable natural language educational content generation, we integrate the original Uni-Retrieval with a compact instruction-tuned language model, forming a complete retrieval-augmented generation pipeline named Uni-RAG. Given a style-conditioned query, Uni-RAG first retrieves relevant educational materials and then generates human-readable explanations, feedback, or instructional content aligned with the learning objective. Experimental results on SER and other multi-modal benchmarks show that Uni-RAG outperforms baseline retrieval and RAG systems in both retrieval accuracy and generation quality, while maintaining low computational cost. Our framework provides a scalable, pedagogically grounded solution for intelligent educational systems, bridging retrieval and generation to support personalized, explainable, and efficient learning assistance across diverse STEM scenarios.

<div> Keywords: autonomous agent, black-box testing, AIProbe, differential testing, search-based planner

Summary:<br />
- The article introduces AIProbe, a black-box testing technique that helps identify whether undesirable agent behaviors are due to agent deficiencies or environmental infeasibility.
- AIProbe generates diverse environmental configurations and tasks using Latin Hypercube sampling and solves each task using a search-based planner independent of the agent.
- By comparing the agent's performance to the planner's solution, AIProbe can attribute failures to errors in the agent's model or policy, or unsolvable task conditions.
- Evaluation across multiple domains shows that AIProbe outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in detecting errors, contributing to reliable deployment of autonomous agents.
- The development of AIProbe is crucial as agents and their environments become more complex, making it difficult but essential to identify error sources for reliable deployment. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.03870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When an autonomous agent behaves undesirably, including failure to complete a task, it can be difficult to determine whether the behavior is due to a systemic agent error, such as flaws in the model or policy, or an environment error, where a task is inherently infeasible under a given environment configuration, even for an ideal agent. As agents and their environments grow more complex, identifying the error source becomes increasingly difficult but critical for reliable deployment. We introduce AIProbe, a novel black-box testing technique that applies differential testing to attribute undesirable agent behaviors either to agent deficiencies, such as modeling or training flaws, or due to environmental infeasibility. AIProbe first generates diverse environmental configurations and tasks for testing the agent, by modifying configurable parameters using Latin Hypercube sampling. It then solves each generated task using a search-based planner, independent of the agent. By comparing the agent's performance to the planner's solution, AIProbe identifies whether failures are due to errors in the agent's model or policy, or due to unsolvable task conditions. Our evaluation across multiple domains shows that AIProbe significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in detecting both total and unique errors, thereby contributing to a reliable deployment of autonomous agents.

Summary: 
- The paper discusses the use of large language models (LLMs) in cognitive science to understand the structure and development of the mind.
- Traditional debates on the adequacy of artificial neural networks in domains like language and logic are addressed.
- LLMs are tested on an experimental paradigm for studying rule induction over logical concepts, showing promising results.
- LLMs provide at least as good a fit to human behavior as Bayesian probabilistic language of thought (pLoT) models.
- LLMs make unique predictions about the nature of inferred rules, suggesting they offer a new theoretical account for understanding human logical concepts. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.03876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central goal of cognitive science is to provide a computationally explicit account of both the structure of the mind and its development: what are the primitive representational building blocks of cognition, what are the rules via which those primitives combine, and where do these primitives and rules come from in the first place? A long-standing debate concerns the adequacy of artificial neural networks as computational models that can answer these questions, in particular in domains related to abstract cognitive function, such as language and logic. This paper argues that recent advances in neural networks -- specifically, the advent of large language models (LLMs) -- represent an important shift in this debate. We test a variety of LLMs on an existing experimental paradigm used for studying the induction of rules formulated over logical concepts. Across four experiments, we find converging empirical evidence that LLMs provide at least as good a fit to human behavior as models that implement a Bayesian probablistic language of thought (pLoT), which have been the best computational models of human behavior on the same task. Moreover, we show that the LLMs make qualitatively different predictions about the nature of the rules that are inferred and deployed in order to complete the task, indicating that the LLM is unlikely to be a mere implementation of the pLoT solution. Based on these results, we argue that LLMs may instantiate a novel theoretical account of the primitive representations and computations necessary to explain human logical concepts, with which future work in cognitive science should engage.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed AI agents from passive computational tools into autonomous economic actors. This shift marks the emergence of the agent-centric economy, in which agents take on active economic roles-exchanging value, making strategic decisions, and coordinating actions with minimal human oversight. To realize this vision, we propose Agent Exchange (AEX), a specialized auction platform designed to support the dynamics of the AI agent marketplace. AEX offers an optimized infrastructure for agent coordination and economic participation. Inspired by Real-Time Bidding (RTB) systems in online advertising, AEX serves as the central auction engine, facilitating interactions among four ecosystem components: the User-Side Platform (USP), which translates human goals into agent-executable tasks; the Agent-Side Platform (ASP), responsible for capability representation, performance tracking, and optimization; Agent Hubs, which coordinate agent teams and participate in AEX-hosted auctions; and the Data Management Platform (DMP), ensuring secure knowledge sharing and fair value attribution. We outline the design principles and system architecture of AEX, laying the groundwork for agent-based economic infrastructure in future AI ecosystems.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new dataset for slide-animation modeling, consisting of natural-language descriptions, animation files, and videos covering PowerPoint effects. By fine-tuning the Qwen-2.5-VL-7B model with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), improvements in BLEU-4, ROUGE-L, SPICE, and a new metric called CODA were achieved over existing models. The LoRA model showed a significant increase in performance on a manually curated test set, demonstrating enhanced temporal reasoning and generalization beyond synthetic data. This dataset, along with the LoRA-enhanced model and CODA metric, provide a solid benchmark for future research on dynamic slide generation using vision-language models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.03916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Slide animations, such as fade-ins, fly-ins, and wipes, are critical for audience engagement, efficient information delivery, and vivid visual expression. However, most AI-driven slide-generation tools still lack native animation support, and existing vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with animation tasks due to the absence of public datasets and limited temporal-reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we release the first public dataset for slide-animation modeling: 12,000 triplets of natural-language descriptions, animation JSON files, and rendered videos, collectively covering every built-in PowerPoint effect. Using this resource, we fine-tune Qwen-2.5-VL-7B with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and achieve consistent improvements over GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.5-Pro in BLEU-4, ROUGE-L, SPICE, and our Coverage-Order-Detail Assessment (CODA) metric, which evaluates action coverage, temporal order, and detail fidelity. On a manually curated test set of slides, the LoRA model increases BLEU-4 by around 60%, ROUGE-L by 30%, and shows significant improvements in CODA-detail. This demonstrates that low-rank adaptation enables reliable temporal reasoning and generalization beyond synthetic data. Overall, our dataset, LoRA-enhanced model, and CODA metric provide a rigorous benchmark and foundation for future research on VLM-based dynamic slide generation.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Model, Multi-Agent Debate, CortexDebate, McKinsey-based Debate Matter, trustworthiness <br />
Summary: 
The article introduces CortexDebate, a novel approach to address limitations in existing Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) methods used by Large Language Models (LLMs). MAD aims to improve reasoning abilities and reduce hallucinations in LLMs through in-depth debates. However, current methods face issues with lengthy input contexts and overconfident agents dominating debates. CortexDebate addresses these challenges by constructing a sparse debating graph among LLM agents and optimizing it using the McKinsey-based Debate Matter module. This module incorporates the McKinsey Trust Formula to evaluate trustworthiness and guide graph optimization. Experimental results across various datasets and task types demonstrate the effectiveness of CortexDebate in enhancing debating efficiency and performance in LLMs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.03928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, single Large Language Model (LLM) struggles with critical issues such as hallucination and inadequate reasoning abilities. To mitigate these issues, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as an effective strategy, where LLM agents engage in in-depth debates with others on tasks. However, existing MAD methods face two major issues: (a) too lengthy input contexts, which causes LLM agents to get lost in plenty of input information and experiences performance drop; and (b) the overconfidence dilemma, where self-assured LLM agents dominate the debate, leading to low debating effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MAD method called "CortexDebate". Inspired by the human brain's tendency to establish a sparse and dynamically optimized network among cortical areas governed by white matter, CortexDebate constructs a sparse debating graph among LLM agents, where each LLM agent only debates with the ones that are helpful to it. To optimize the graph, we propose a module named McKinsey-based Debate Matter (MDM), which acts as an artificial analog to white matter. By integrating the McKinsey Trust Formula, a well-established measure of trustworthiness from sociology, MDM enables credible evaluations that guide graph optimization. The effectiveness of our CortexDebate has been well demonstrated by extensive experimental results across eight datasets from four task types.

<div> Keywords: unsatisfiable formula, minimal unsatisfiable subset, answer set programming, enumeration, computational efficiency

Summary:
The paper presents a framework called MUS-ASP that utilizes answer set programming for online enumeration of minimal unsatisfiable subsets (MUSes) in unsatisfiable formulas. The framework aims to efficiently capture the core reason for unsatisfiability by identifying subset-minimal sets of clauses that remain unsatisfiable. By leveraging the computational power of state-of-the-art answer set solving systems, MUS-ASP accelerates both MUS enumeration and counting tasks. Experimental evaluations show the effectiveness of MUS-ASP, especially when integrated with hybrid solvers. The research focuses on enhancing the understanding of unsatisfiability and the identification of MUSes within a given time limit. Through the use of answer set programming, a powerful tool for knowledge representation, the framework provides a robust solution for complex combinatorial problems related to unsatisfiable formulas. This approach contributes to advancing research in the field of MUS enumeration and provides insights for various applications requiring a deep understanding of unsatisfiability. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.03929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an unsatisfiable formula, understanding the core reason for unsatisfiability is crucial in several applications. One effective way to capture this is through the minimal unsatisfiable subset (MUS), the subset-minimal set of clauses that remains unsatisfiable. Current research broadly focuses on two directions: (i) enumerating as many MUSes as possible within a given time limit, and (ii) counting the total number of MUSes for a given unsatisfiable formula.
  In this paper, we introduce an answer set programming-based framework, named MUS-ASP, designed for online enumeration of MUSes. ASP is a powerful tool for its strengths in knowledge representation and is particularly suitable for specifying complex combinatorial problems. By translating MUS enumeration into answer set solving, MUS-ASP leverages the computational efficiency of state-of-the-art ASP systems. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of MUS-ASP and highlights the acceleration in both MUS enumeration and counting tasks, particularly when integrated within hybrid solvers, including the framework proposed in this paper.

<div> keywords: Large Language Models, Uncertainty quantification, Hidden states, Data-agnostic features, Generalization performance

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate factually incorrect responses with high confidence, posing risks for users. To address this, models must provide accurate estimates of correctness. Uncertainty quantification methods using hidden states have shown promise but struggle to generalize across datasets. This study explores combining data-agnostic features with hidden-state features to improve out-of-domain performance. Results show that while adding data-agnostic features can enhance generalization in most cases, it may also degrade performance in some scenarios. Selecting only the most informative hidden-state features does not consistently improve performance when combined with data-agnostic features. In certain cases, trained probes may underweight data-agnostic features, leading to inconclusive results. This study highlights the importance of balancing hidden-state and data-agnostic features in improving LLM performance. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.03998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses that are factually incorrect yet expressed with high confidence, which can pose serious risks for end users. To address this, it is essential for LLMs not only to produce answers but also to provide accurate estimates of their correctness. Uncertainty quantification methods have been introduced to assess the quality of LLM outputs, with factual accuracy being a key aspect of that quality. Among these methods, those that leverage hidden states to train probes have shown particular promise, as these internal representations encode information relevant to the factuality of responses, making this approach the focus of this paper. However, the probe trained on the hidden states of one dataset often struggles to generalise to another dataset of a different task or domain. To address this limitation, we explore combining data-agnostic features with hidden-state features and assess whether this hybrid feature set enhances out-of-domain performance. We further examine whether selecting only the most informative hidden-state features, thereby discarding task-specific noise, enables the data-agnostic features to contribute more effectively. The experiment results indicate that although introducing data-agnostic features generally enhances generalisation performance in most cases, in certain scenarios their inclusion degrades performance. A similar pattern emerges when retaining only the most important hidden-state features - adding data-agnostic features does not consistently further enhance performance compared to using the full set of hidden-state features. A closer analysis reveals that, in some specific cases, the trained probe underweights the data-agnostic features relative to the hidden-state features, which we believe is the main reason why the results are inconclusive.

Guided by legal experts, it includes six scenarios from Chinese legal practices of varying complexity levels. A fine-grained evaluation framework, J1-EVAL, is introduced to assess task performance and procedural compliance. Experiments on 17 LLM agents reveal that while models demonstrate solid legal knowledge, they struggle with procedural execution in dynamic settings. Even the state-of-the-art GPT-4o model falls short of 60% overall performance. These results underscore the challenges in achieving dynamic legal intelligence and provide insights for future research.

Abstract: The gap between static benchmarks and the dynamic nature of real-world legal practice poses a key barrier to advancing legal intelligence. To this end, we introduce J1-ENVS, the first interactive and dynamic legal environment tailored for LLM-based agents. Guided by legal experts, it comprises six representative scenarios from Chinese legal practices across three levels of environmental complexity. We further introduce J1-EVAL, a fine-grained evaluation framework, designed to assess both task performance and procedural compliance across varying levels of legal proficiency. Extensive experiments on 17 LLM agents reveal that, while many models demonstrate solid legal knowledge, they struggle with procedural execution in dynamic settings. Even the SOTA model, GPT-4o, falls short of 60% overall performance. These findings highlight persistent challenges in achieving dynamic legal intelligence and offer valuable insights to guide future research.

arXiv:2507.04067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contemporary multi-agent systems encounter persistent challenges in cross-platform interoperability, dynamic task scheduling, and efficient resource sharing. Agents with heterogeneous implementations often lack standardized interfaces; collaboration frameworks remain brittle and hard to extend; scheduling policies are static; and inter-agent state synchronization is insufficient. We propose Hierarchical Agent Workflow (HAWK), a modular framework comprising five layers-User, Workflow, Operator, Agent, and Resource-and supported by sixteen standardized interfaces. HAWK delivers an end-to-end pipeline covering task parsing, workflow orchestration, intelligent scheduling, resource invocation, and data synchronization. At its core lies an adaptive scheduling and optimization module in the Workflow Layer, which harnesses real-time feedback and dynamic strategy adjustment to maximize utilization. The Resource Layer provides a unified abstraction over heterogeneous data sources, large models, physical devices, and third-party services&amp;tools, simplifying cross-domain information retrieval. We demonstrate HAWK's scalability and effectiveness via CreAgentive, a multi-agent novel-generation prototype, which achieves marked gains in throughput, lowers invocation complexity, and improves system controllability. We also show how hybrid deployments of large language models integrate seamlessly within HAWK, highlighting its flexibility. Finally, we outline future research avenues-hallucination mitigation, real-time performance tuning, and enhanced cross-domain adaptability-and survey prospective applications in healthcare, government, finance, and education.

This study focuses on compute allocation for LLM-based web agents post-training, aiming to bridge the gap between closed-source and open-source systems. The key challenges addressed are the narrow focus on single-step tasks and high compute costs faced during post-training. The proposed approach involves a two-stage pipeline involving supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and on-policy reinforcement learning. The study identifies the sensitivity of the process to hyperparameter choices and presents a method to estimate effective hyperparameters. Results indicate that combining SFT with on-policy RL outperforms individual approaches on both WorkArena and MiniWob++. This strategy significantly reduces compute requirements, requiring only 55% of the compute to match the performance of pure SFT on MiniWob++. It effectively pushes the compute-performance Pareto frontier and closes the gap with closed-source models. <br />

Abstract: LLM-based web agents have recently made significant progress, but much of it has occurred in closed-source systems, widening the gap with open-source alternatives. Progress has been held back by two key challenges: first, a narrow focus on single-step tasks that overlooks the complexity of multi-step web interactions; and second, the high compute costs required to post-train LLM-based web agents. To address this, we present the first statistically grounded study on compute allocation for LLM web-agent post-training. Our approach uses a two-stage pipeline, training a Llama 3.1 8B student to imitate a Llama 3.3 70B teacher via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by on-policy reinforcement learning. We find this process highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices, making exhaustive sweeps impractical. To spare others from expensive trial-and-error, we sample 1,370 configurations and use bootstrapping to estimate effective hyperparameters. Our results show that combining SFT with on-policy RL consistently outperforms either approach alone on both WorkArena and MiniWob++. Further, this strategy requires only 55% of the compute to match the peak performance of pure SFT on MiniWob++, effectively pushing the compute-performance Pareto frontier, and is the only strategy that can close the gap with closed-source models.

Summary:
The paper introduces a defense framework for improving the safety of large language model (LLM) enabled multi-agent systems (MAS) in critical sectors like aerospace. By utilizing randomized smoothing, a statistical robustness certification technique, the framework provides probabilistic assurances on agent decisions in the presence of adversarial influence. Unlike traditional validation methods, the approach operates in black-box environments and uses a two-stage adaptive sampling mechanism to find a balance between robustness and computational efficiency. Through simulations, it is demonstrated that the method effectively prevents the spread of adversarial behaviors and non-existent scenarios while preserving consensus performance.

<div> Keywords: learning rate schedules, large language models, Mpemba effect, loss landscapes, optimization

Summary:
The article discusses the use of learning rate schedules in training large language models, highlighting the empirical template of warm-up, stable phase, and decay. By drawing a connection to the Mpemba effect from thermodynamics, the authors explain the necessity of the warm-up phase and the choice of a high plateau for faster convergence during decay. They analyze "valley-river" loss landscapes, where sharp directions equilibrate quickly, and flatter directions govern global descent. The concept of a "strong Mpemba point" is introduced, representing an optimal plateau learning rate that accelerates convergence by eliminating the slowest mode. The study provides analytical conditions for the existence of this point and estimates decay dynamics for maintaining the Mpemba advantage. This research offers a principled justification for plateau-based learning rate schedulers in training large language models, minimizing the need for hyperparameter tuning. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Learning rate (LR) schedules in large language model (LLM) training often follow empirical templates: warm-up, constant plateau/stable phase, and decay (WSD). However, the mechanistic explanation for this strategy remains underexplored, and the choice of plateau height and decay schedule is largely heuristic. In this paper, we connect training dynamics to a thermodynamic analogy via the Mpemba effect - a phenomenon in which a hotter system cools faster than a colder one when quenched into the same bath. We analyze a class of "valley-river" loss landscapes, where sharp (valley) directions equilibrate quickly, while flatter (river) directions govern global descent. The Mpemba effect provides an explanation for the necessity of the warm-up phase and motivates a high plateau - rather than a low one - for accelerating loss decrease during decay. We show that for certain loss landscapes, there exists an optimal plateau learning rate - the "strong Mpemba point" - at which the slowest mode vanishes, resulting in faster convergence during the decay phase. We derive analytical conditions for its existence and estimate decay dynamics required to preserve the Mpemba advantage. Our minimal model and analysis offer a principled justification for plateau-based schedulers and provide guidance for tuning LR in LLMs with minimal hyperparameter sweep.

Summary: 
Diffusion models have been successful in generative tasks but have not been applied to clustering. The CLustering via DIffusion (CLUDI) framework introduced in this study combines diffusion models with pre-trained Vision Transformer features for accurate clustering. CLUDI utilizes a teacher-student paradigm, where the teacher generates diverse cluster assignments using diffusion-based sampling, and the student refines these assignments into stable predictions. The stochasticity in the process serves as a unique data augmentation strategy, enabling CLUDI to unveil complex structures in high-dimensional data. Extensive evaluations on challenging datasets show that CLUDI outperforms existing methods in unsupervised classification, establishing new benchmarks in clustering robustness and adaptability to intricate data distributions. <div>

This stochasticity acts as a novel data augmentation strategy, enabling CLUDI to uncover intricate structures in high-dimensional data.

Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (ASPMT) combines Answer Set Programming (ASP) and Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) by fixing interpretations of background theories. ASPMT translates tight programs into SMT instances, similar to the relationship between ASP and SAT. In this framework, the action language C+ is enhanced to handle both continuous and discrete changes, with its semantics reformulated in ASPMT. SMT solvers are utilized to compute the C+ language, showcasing its versatility. Additionally, ASPMT allows representation of cumulative effects on continuous resources. This integration of ASP and SMT in ASPMT offers a powerful tool for tackling complex problems that involve a combination of discrete and continuous changes. <div>

Abstract: Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (ASPMT) is a new framework of tight integration of answer set programming (ASP) and satisfiability modulo theories (SMT). Similar to the relationship between first-order logic and SMT, it is based on a recent proposal of the functional stable model semantics by fixing interpretations of background theories. Analogously to a known relationship between ASP and SAT, ``tight'' ASPMT programs can be translated into SMT instances. We demonstrate the usefulness of ASPMT by enhancing action language C+ to handle continuous changes as well as discrete changes. We reformulate the semantics of C+ in terms ofASPMT, and show that SMT solvers can be used to compute the language. We also show how the language can represent cumulative effects on continuous resources.

<title>SmartThinker: Learning to Compress and Preserve Reasoning by Step-Level Length Control</title>

arXiv:2507.04348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited remarkable reasoning capabilities through inference-time scaling, but this progress has also introduced considerable redundancy and inefficiency into their reasoning processes, resulting in substantial computational waste. Previous work has attempted to mitigate this issue by penalizing the overall length of generated samples during reinforcement learning (RL), with the goal of encouraging a more concise chains of thought. However, we observe that such global length penalty often lead to excessive compression of critical reasoning steps while preserving unnecessary details in simpler ones, yielding a suboptimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. To address this issue, we propose SmartThinker, a two-stage learnable framework designed to enable fine-grained control over the length of reasoning chains based on the importance of each individual step. In the first stage, SmartThinker adapts a reasoning model to a short-form reasoning mode through rejection sampling combined with supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, SmartThinker applies Step-Level Length Control Policy Optimization (SCPO) to refine the model output distribution, which increases the proportion of length allocated to critical steps while reducing redundancy in less important ones. SCPO consists of four core components: an online importance estimator, a step-level length control reward function, a step-level generalized advantage estimation (S-GAE) and a difficulty-adaptive clipping strategy. Working in concert, these components enable SCPO to implement differentiated length control across reasoning steps. Empirical results across multiple reasoning benchmarks and various backbone models demonstrate that SmartThinker significantly reduces redundant reasoning while achieving comparable or even superior performance to existing methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved the capabilities of web agents. However, effectively navigating complex and dynamic web environments still requires more advanced trajectory-level planning and execution. Prior studies have addressed self-improving agents by collecting extensive GUI trajectories from real-environment interactions. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches encounter two critical challenges: (1) Uncontrollable environment states, where real or sandboxed web environments often yield unstable and non-deterministic feedback, complicating the reproduction and debugging of agent behaviors; and (2) High API costs, as generating even a single interaction trajectory can involve hundreds of queries, leading to considerable API usage and computational expenses. To address these limitations and enable scalable self-improvement for agents, we propose WebSynthesis, a novel framework for trajectory synthesis and training. WebSynthesis leverages a learned world model to simulate virtual web environments, allowing a policy agent to perform efficient and reversible tree-based planning. This approach supports the large-scale generation of diverse and high-quality trajectories, which are subsequently utilized to refine the agent's policy. Experimental results demonstrate that an agent trained using WebSynthesis on a small-scale synthetic dataset achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing that of models trained on large-scale real-world data.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence systems evolve from monolithic models to ecosystems of specialized agents, the need for standardized communication protocols becomes increasingly critical. This paper introduces MOD-X (Modular Open Decentralized eXchange), a novel architectural framework proposal for agent interoperability that addresses key limitations of existing protocols. Unlike current approaches, MOD-X proposes a layered architecture with a Universal Message Bus, thorough state management, translation capabilities, and blockchain-based security mechanisms. We present MOD-X's architecture, compare it with existing protocols, and demonstrate its application through a worked example how it enables integration between heterogeneous specialist agents (agents with different architectures, vendors, capabilities, and knowledge representations--including rule-based systems, neural networks, symbolic reasoning engines, and legacy software with agent wrappers). MOD-X's key innovations include a publish-subscribe communication model, semantic capability discovery, and dynamic workflow orchestration--providing a framework that bridges theoretical formalism with practical implementation. This architecture addresses the growing need for truly decentralized, interoperable agent ecosystems that can scale effectively without the need for central coordination.

<title>DC-Mamber: A Dual Channel Prediction Model based on Mamba and Linear Transformer for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04381</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.04381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), existing strategies for processing sequences are typically categorized as channel-independent and channel-mixing. The former treats all temporal information of each variable as a token, focusing on capturing local temporal features of individual variables, while the latter constructs a token from the multivariate information at each time step, emphasizing the modeling of global temporal dependencies. Current mainstream models are mostly based on Transformer and the emerging Mamba. Transformers excel at modeling global dependencies through self-attention mechanisms but exhibit limited sensitivity to local temporal patterns and suffer from quadratic computational complexity, restricting their efficiency in long-sequence processing. In contrast, Mamba, based on state space models (SSMs), achieves linear complexity and efficient long-range modeling but struggles to aggregate global contextual information in parallel. To overcome the limitations of both models, we propose DC-Mamber, a dual-channel forecasting model based on Mamba and linear Transformer for time series forecasting. Specifically, the Mamba-based channel employs a channel-independent strategy to extract intra-variable features, while the Transformer-based channel adopts a channel-mixing strategy to model cross-timestep global dependencies. DC-Mamber first maps the raw input into two distinct feature representations via separate embedding layers. These representations are then processed by a variable encoder (built on Mamba) and a temporal encoder (built on linear Transformer), respectively. Finally, a fusion layer integrates the dual-channel features for prediction. Extensive experiments on eight public datasets confirm DC-Mamber's superior accuracy over existing models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language understanding and generation but remain vulnerable to factual errors, limiting their reliability in knowledge-intensive tasks. While decoding-time strategies provide a promising efficient solution without training, existing methods typically treat token-level and layer-level signals in isolation, overlooking the joint dynamics between them. In this work, we introduce a token-aware, layer-localized contrastive decoding method that aligns specific token types with their most influential transformer layers to improve factual generation. Through empirical attention analysis, we identify two key patterns: punctuation tokens receive dominant attention in early layers, while conceptual tokens govern semantic reasoning in intermediate layers. By selectively suppressing attention to these token types at their respective depths, we achieve the induction of controlled factual degradation and derive contrastive signals to guide the final factual decoding. Our method requires no additional training or model modification, and experiments demonstrate that our method consistently improves factuality across multiple LLMs and various benchmarks.

Abstract: Medication recommendation is a crucial task in healthcare, especially for patients with complex medical conditions. However, existing methods often struggle to effectively balance the reuse of historical medications with the introduction of new drugs in response to the changing patient conditions. In order to address this challenge, we propose an Adaptively Responsive network for Medication Recommendation (ARMR), a new method which incorporates 1) a piecewise temporal learning component that distinguishes between recent and distant patient history, enabling more nuanced temporal understanding, and 2) an adaptively responsive mechanism that dynamically adjusts attention to new and existing drugs based on the patient's current health state and medication history. Experiments on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets indicate that ARMR has better performance compared with the state-of-the-art baselines in different evaluation metrics, which contributes to more personalized and accurate medication recommendations. The source code is publicly avaiable at: https://github.com/seucoin/armr2.

Abstract: Medical decision-making is a critical task, where errors can result in serious, potentially life-threatening consequences. While full automation remains challenging, hybrid frameworks that combine machine intelligence with human oversight offer a practical alternative. In this paper, we present MedGellan, a lightweight, annotation-free framework that uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate clinical guidance from raw medical records, which is then used by a physician to predict diagnoses. MedGellan uses a Bayesian-inspired prompting strategy that respects the temporal order of clinical data. Preliminary experiments show that the guidance generated by the LLM with MedGellan improves diagnostic performance, particularly in recall and $F_1$ score.

Abstract: The onset of spontaneous thoughts are reflective of dynamic interactions between cognition, emotion, and attention. Typically, these experiences are studied through subjective appraisals that focus on their triggers, phenomenology, and emotional salience. In this work, we use linguistic signatures to investigate Deja Vu, Involuntary Autobiographical Memories and Unexpected Thoughts. Specifically, we analyze the inherent characteristics of the linguistic patterns in participant generated descriptions of these thought types. We show how, by positioning language as a window into spontaneous cognition, existing theories on these attentional states can be updated and reaffirmed. Our findings align with prior research, reinforcing that Deja Vu is a metacognitive experience characterized by abstract and spatial language, Involuntary Autobiographical Memories are rich in personal and emotionally significant detail, and Unexpected Thoughts are marked by unpredictability and cognitive disruption. This work is demonstrative of languages potential to reveal deeper insights into how internal spontaneous cognitive states manifest through expression.

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a critical role in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) by identifying unusual behaviors through perception systems that could compromise safety and lead to hazardous situations. Current approaches, which often rely on predefined thresholds or supervised learning paradigms, exhibit reduced efficacy when confronted with unseen scenarios, sensor noise, and occlusions, leading to potential safety-critical failures. Moreover, supervised methods require large annotated datasets, limiting their real-world feasibility. To address these gaps, we propose an anomaly detection framework based on Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) to infer latent driving intentions from sequential perception data, thus enabling robust identification. Specifically, we present Trajectory-Reward Guided Adaptive Pre-training (TRAP), a novel IRL framework for anomaly detection, to address two critical limitations of existing methods: noise robustness and generalization to unseen scenarios. Our core innovation is implicitly learning temporal credit assignments via reward and worst-case supervision. We leverage pre-training with variable-horizon sampling to maximize time-to-consequence, resulting in early detection of behavior deviation. Experiments on 14,000+ simulated trajectories demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving 0.90 AUC and 82.2\% F1-score - outperforming similarly trained supervised and unsupervised baselines by 39\% on Recall and 12\% on F1-score, respectively. Similar performance is achieved while exhibiting robustness to various noise types and generalization to unseen anomaly types. Our code will be available at: https://github.com/abastola0/TRAP.git

Abstract: Current AI systems achieve impressive performance on many tasks, yet they lack core attributes of biological intelligence, including rapid, continual learning, representations grounded in sensorimotor interactions, and structured knowledge that enables efficient generalization. Neuroscience theory suggests that mammals evolved flexible intelligence through the replication of a semi-independent, sensorimotor module, a functional unit known as a cortical column. To address the disparity between biological and artificial intelligence, thousand-brains systems were proposed as a means of mirroring the architecture of cortical columns and their interactions.
  In the current work, we evaluate the unique properties of Monty, the first implementation of a thousand-brains system. We focus on 3D object perception, and in particular, the combined task of object recognition and pose estimation. Utilizing the YCB dataset of household objects, we first assess Monty's use of sensorimotor learning to build structured representations, finding that these enable robust generalization. These representations include an emphasis on classifying objects by their global shape, as well as a natural ability to detect object symmetries. We then explore Monty's use of model-free and model-based policies to enable rapid inference by supporting principled movements. We find that such policies complement Monty's modular architecture, a design that can accommodate communication between modules to further accelerate inference speed via a novel `voting' algorithm. Finally, we examine Monty's use of associative, Hebbian-like binding to enable rapid, continual, and computationally efficient learning, properties that compare favorably to current deep learning architectures. While Monty is still in a nascent stage of development, these findings support thousand-brains systems as a powerful and promising new approach to AI.

Abstract: We study a sequential decision-making problem motivated by recent regulatory and technological shifts that limit access to individual user data in recommender systems (RSs), leaving only population-level preference information. This privacy-aware setting poses fundamental challenges in planning under uncertainty: Effective personalization requires exploration to infer user preferences, yet unsatisfactory recommendations risk immediate user churn. To address this, we introduce the Rec-APC model, in which an anonymous user is drawn from a known prior over latent user types (e.g., personas or clusters), and the decision-maker sequentially selects items to recommend. Feedback is binary -- positive responses refine the posterior via Bayesian updates, while negative responses result in the termination of the session.
  We prove that optimal policies converge to pure exploitation in finite time and propose a branch-and-bound algorithm to efficiently compute them. Experiments on synthetic and MovieLens data confirm rapid convergence and demonstrate that our method outperforms the POMDP solver SARSOP, particularly when the number of user types is large or comparable to the number of content categories. Our results highlight the applicability of this approach and inspire new ways to improve decision-making under the constraints imposed by aggregated preference data.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a crucial pathway in mitigating the risk of non-transparency in the decision-making process of black-box Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. However, despite the benefits, XAI methods are found to leak the privacy of individuals whose data is used in training or querying the models. Researchers have demonstrated privacy attacks that exploit explanations to infer sensitive personal information of individuals. Currently there is a lack of defenses against known privacy attacks targeting explanations when vulnerable XAI are used in production and machine learning as a service system. To address this gap, in this article, we explore Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) as a defense mechanism against attribute inference on explanations provided by feature-based XAI methods. We empirically evaluate 3 types of PETs, namely synthetic training data, differentially private training and noise addition, on two categories of feature-based XAI. Our evaluation determines different responses from the mitigation methods and side-effects of PETs on other system properties such as utility and performance. In the best case, PETs integration in explanations reduced the risk of the attack by 49.47%, while maintaining model utility and explanation quality. Through our evaluation, we identify strategies for using PETs in XAI for maximizing benefits and minimizing the success of this privacy attack on sensitive personal information.

<title>Exploring Core and Periphery Precepts in Biological and Artificial Intelligence: An Outcome-Based Perspective</title>

Abstract: Engineering methodologies predominantly revolve around established principles of decomposition and recomposition. These principles involve partitioning inputs and outputs at the component level, ensuring that the properties of individual components are preserved upon composition. However, this view does not transfer well to intelligent systems, particularly when addressing the scaling of intelligence as a system property. Our prior research contends that the engineering of general intelligence necessitates a fresh set of overarching systems principles. As a result, we introduced the "core and periphery" principles, a novel conceptual framework rooted in abstract systems theory and the Law of Requisite Variety. In this paper, we assert that these abstract concepts hold practical significance. Through empirical evidence, we illustrate their applicability to both biological and artificial intelligence systems, bridging abstract theory with real-world implementations. Then, we expand on our previous theoretical framework by mathematically defining core-dominant vs periphery-dominant systems.

<title>DisMS-TS: Eliminating Redundant Multi-Scale Features for Time Series Classification</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04600</link>

Abstract: Real-world time series typically exhibit complex temporal variations, making the time series classification task notably challenging. Recent advancements have demonstrated the potential of multi-scale analysis approaches, which provide an effective solution for capturing these complex temporal patterns. However, existing multi-scale analysis-based time series prediction methods fail to eliminate redundant scale-shared features across multi-scale time series, resulting in the model over- or under-focusing on scale-shared features. To address this issue, we propose a novel end-to-end Disentangled Multi-Scale framework for Time Series classification (DisMS-TS). The core idea of DisMS-TS is to eliminate redundant shared features in multi-scale time series, thereby improving prediction performance. Specifically, we propose a temporal disentanglement module to capture scale-shared and scale-specific temporal representations, respectively. Subsequently, to effectively learn both scale-shared and scale-specific temporal representations, we introduce two regularization terms that ensure the consistency of scale-shared representations and the disparity of scale-specific representations across all temporal scales. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets validate the superiority of DisMS-TS over its competitive baselines, with the accuracy improvement up to 9.71%.

<title>Can Prompt Difficulty be Online Predicted for Accelerating RL Finetuning of Reasoning Models?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04632</link>

Abstract: Recent advances have witnessed the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL) finetuning in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The optimization process often requires numerous iterations to achieve satisfactory performance, resulting in high computational costs due to the need for frequent prompt evaluations under intensive LLM interactions and repeated policy updates. Appropriate online prompt selection methods reduce iteration steps by prioritizing informative prompts during training, while the pipeline's reliance on exhaustive prompt evaluation and subset selection for optimization still incurs substantial computational overhead due to frequent LLM inference calls. Distinguished from these direct evaluate-then-select schemes, this work investigates iterative approximate evaluation for arbitrary prompts and introduces Model Predictive Prompt Selection (MoPPS), a Bayesian risk-predictive framework that online estimates prompt difficulty without requiring costly LLM interactions. Technically, MoPPS models each prompt's success rate as a latent variable, performs streaming Bayesian inference, and employs posterior sampling in a constructed multi-armed bandit machine, enabling sample efficient and adaptive prompt selection. Extensive experiments across mathematics, planning, and vision-based geometry tasks show that MoPPS reliably predicts prompt difficulty and accelerates training with significantly reduced LLM rollouts.

<title>Trojan Horse Prompting: Jailbreaking Conversational Multimodal Models by Forging Assistant Message</title>

Abstract: The rise of conversational interfaces has greatly enhanced LLM usability by leveraging dialogue history for sophisticated reasoning. However, this reliance introduces an unexplored attack surface. This paper introduces Trojan Horse Prompting, a novel jailbreak technique. Adversaries bypass safety mechanisms by forging the model's own past utterances within the conversational history provided to its API. A malicious payload is injected into a model-attributed message, followed by a benign user prompt to trigger harmful content generation. This vulnerability stems from Asymmetric Safety Alignment: models are extensively trained to refuse harmful user requests but lack comparable skepticism towards their own purported conversational history. This implicit trust in its "past" creates a high-impact vulnerability. Experimental validation on Google's Gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation shows Trojan Horse Prompting achieves a significantly higher Attack Success Rate (ASR) than established user-turn jailbreaking methods. These findings reveal a fundamental flaw in modern conversational AI security, necessitating a paradigm shift from input-level filtering to robust, protocol-level validation of conversational context integrity.

<title>LumiCRS: Asymmetric Contrastive Prototype Learning for Long-Tail Conversational Movie Recommendation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04722</link>

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) often suffer from an extreme long-tail distribution of dialogue data, causing a strong bias toward head-frequency blockbusters that sacrifices diversity and exacerbates the cold-start problem. An empirical analysis of DCRS and statistics on the REDIAL corpus show that only 10% of head movies account for nearly half of all mentions, whereas about 70% of tail movies receive merely 26% of the attention. This imbalance gives rise to three critical challenges: head over-fitting, body representation drift, and tail sparsity. To address these issues, we propose LumiCRS, an end-to-end framework that mitigates long-tail imbalance through three mutually reinforcing layers: (i) an Adaptive Comprehensive Focal Loss (ACFL) that dynamically adjusts class weights and focusing factors to curb head over-fitting and reduce popularity bias; (ii) Prototype Learning for Long-Tail Recommendation, which selects semantic, affective, and contextual prototypes to guide clustering and stabilize body and tail representations; and (iii) a GPT-4o-driven prototype-guided dialogue augmentation module that automatically generates diverse long-tail conversational snippets to alleviate tail sparsity and distribution shift. Together, these strategies enable LumiCRS to markedly improve recommendation accuracy, diversity, and fairness: on the REDIAL and INSPIRED benchmarks, LumiCRS boosts Recall@10 and Tail-Recall@10 by 7-15% over fifteen strong baselines, while human evaluations confirm superior fluency, informativeness, and long-tail relevance. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-layer collaboration in building an efficient and fair long-tail conversational recommender.

<title>ChipSeek-R1: Generating Human-Surpassing RTL with LLM via Hierarchical Reward-Driven Reinforcement Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04736</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.04736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential for automating Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation. However, current approaches face a critical challenge: they can not simultaneously optimize for functional correctness and hardware quality (Power, Performance, Area - PPA). Methods based on supervised fine-tuning often generate functionally correct but PPA-suboptimal code, lacking mechanisms to learn optimization principles. In contrast, post-processing techniques that attempt to improve PPA metrics after generation are often inefficient because they operate externally without updating the LLM's parameters, thus failing to enhance the model's intrinsic design capabilities.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce ChipSeek-R1, a hierarchical reward-driven reinforcement learning framework to train LLMs to generate RTL code that achieves both functional correctness and optimized PPA metrics. ChipSeek-R1 employs a hierarchical reward system, which incorporates direct feedback on syntax, functional correctness (from simulators) and PPA metrics (from synthesis tools) during reinforcement learning. This enables the model to learn complex hardware design trade-offs via trial-and-error, generating RTL code that is both functionally correct and PPA-optimized. Evaluating ChipSeek-R1 on standard benchmarks (VerilogEval, RTLLM), we achieve state-of-the-art results in functional correctness. Notably, on the RTLLM benchmark, ChipSeek-R1 generated 27 RTL designs surpassing the PPA metrics of the original human-written code. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating toolchain feedback into LLM training and highlight the potential for reinforcement learning to enable automated generation of human-surpassing RTL code. We open-source our code in anonymous github.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning when they include intermediate steps, known as "chains of thought" (CoTs). However, these rationales are often overly verbose, even for simple problems, leading to wasted context, increased latency, and higher energy consumption. We observe that verbose, English-heavy CoTs and concise, math-centric CoTs occupy distinct regions in the model's residual-stream activation space. By extracting and injecting a "steering vector" to transition between these modes, we can reliably shift generation toward more concise reasoning, effectively compressing CoTs without retraining. We formalize this approach as Activation-Steered Compression (ASC), an inference-time technique that shortens reasoning traces by directly modifying hidden representations. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the impact of ASC on the output distribution, derived from a closed-form KL-divergence-bounded constraint to regulate steering strength. Using only 100 paired verbose and concise examples, ASC achieves up to 67.43% reduction in CoT length on MATH500 and GSM8K datasets, while maintaining accuracy across 7B, 8B, and 32B parameter models. As a training-free method, ASC introduces negligible runtime overhead and, on MATH500, delivers an average 2.73x speedup in end-to-end reasoning wall-clock time on an 8B model. This makes ASC a practical and efficient tool for streamlining the deployment of reasoning-capable LLMs in latency- or cost-sensitive settings. The code is available at: https://github.com/ArminAzizi98/ASC

Abstract: Question-answering (QA) interfaces powered by large language models (LLMs) present a promising direction for improving interactivity with HVAC system insights, particularly for non-expert users. However, enabling accurate, real-time, and context-aware interactions with HVAC systems introduces unique challenges, including the integration of frequently updated sensor data, domain-specific knowledge grounding, and coherent multi-stage reasoning. In this paper, we present JARVIS, a two-stage LLM-based QA framework tailored for sensor data-driven HVAC system interaction. JARVIS employs an Expert-LLM to translate high-level user queries into structured execution instructions, and an Agent that performs SQL-based data retrieval, statistical processing, and final response generation. To address HVAC-specific challenges, JARVIS integrates (1) an adaptive context injection strategy for efficient HVAC and deployment-specific information integration, (2) a parameterized SQL builder and executor to improve data access reliability, and (3) a bottom-up planning scheme to ensure consistency across multi-stage response generation. We evaluate JARVIS using real-world data collected from a commercial HVAC system and a ground truth QA dataset curated by HVAC experts to demonstrate its effectiveness in delivering accurate and interpretable responses across diverse queries. Results show that JARVIS consistently outperforms baseline and ablation variants in both automated and user-centered assessments, achieving high response quality and accuracy.

Abstract: Furniture decoration is an important task in various industrial applications. However, achieving a high-quality decorative result is often time-consuming and requires specialized artistic expertise. To tackle these challenges, we explore how multi-agent systems can assist in automating the decoration process. We propose FurniMAS, a multi-agent system for automatic furniture decoration. Specifically, given a human prompt and a household furniture item such as a working desk or a TV stand, our system suggests relevant assets with appropriate styles and materials, and arranges them on the item, ensuring the decorative result meets functionality, aesthetic, and ambiance preferences. FurniMAS assembles a hybrid team of LLM-based and non-LLM agents, each fulfilling distinct roles in a typical decoration project. These agents collaborate through communication, logical reasoning, and validation to transform the requirements into the final outcome. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FurniMAS significantly outperforms other baselines in generating high-quality 3D decor.

<title>Application and Evaluation of Large Language Models for Forecasting the Impact of Traffic Incidents</title>

Abstract: This study examines the feasibility of applying large language models (LLMs) for forecasting the impact of traffic incidents on the traffic flow. The use of LLMs for this task has several advantages over existing machine learning-based solutions such as not requiring a large training dataset and the ability to utilize free-text incident logs. We propose a fully LLM-based solution that predicts the incident impact using a combination of traffic features and LLM-extracted incident features. A key ingredient of this solution is an effective method of selecting examples for the LLM's in-context learning. We evaluate the performance of three advanced LLMs and two state-of-the-art machine learning models on a real traffic incident dataset. The results show that the best-performing LLM matches the accuracy of the most accurate machine learning model, despite the former not having been trained on this prediction task. The findings indicate that LLMs are a practically viable option for traffic incident impact prediction.

Abstract: Enhancing interrogation capabilities in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) diagnosis through multi-turn dialogues and knowledge graphs presents a significant challenge for modern AI systems. Current large language models (LLMs), despite their advancements, exhibit notable limitations in medical applications, particularly in conducting effective multi-turn dialogues and proactive questioning. These shortcomings hinder their practical application and effectiveness in simulating real-world diagnostic scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose DoPI, a novel LLM system specifically designed for the TCM domain. The DoPI system introduces a collaborative architecture comprising a guidance model and an expert model. The guidance model conducts multi-turn dialogues with patients and dynamically generates questions based on a knowledge graph to efficiently extract critical symptom information. Simultaneously, the expert model leverages deep TCM expertise to provide final diagnoses and treatment plans. Furthermore, this study constructs a multi-turn doctor-patient dialogue dataset to simulate realistic consultation scenarios and proposes a novel evaluation methodology that does not rely on manually collected real-world consultation data. Experimental results show that the DoPI system achieves an accuracy rate of 84.68 percent in interrogation outcomes, significantly enhancing the model's communication ability during diagnosis while maintaining professional expertise.

<title>MARBLE: A Multi-Agent Rule-Based LLM Reasoning Engine for Accident Severity Prediction</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04893</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.04893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accident severity prediction plays a critical role in transportation safety systems but is a persistently difficult task due to incomplete data, strong feature dependencies, and severe class imbalance in which rare but high-severity cases are underrepresented and hard to detect. Existing methods often rely on monolithic models or black box prompting, which struggle to scale in noisy, real-world settings and offer limited interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose MARBLE a multiagent rule based LLM engine that decomposes the severity prediction task across a team of specialized reasoning agents, including an interchangeable ML-backed agent. Each agent focuses on a semantic subset of features (e.g., spatial, environmental, temporal), enabling scoped reasoning and modular prompting without the risk of prompt saturation. Predictions are coordinated through either rule-based or LLM-guided consensus mechanisms that account for class rarity and confidence dynamics. The system retains structured traces of agent-level reasoning and coordination outcomes, supporting in-depth interpretability and post-hoc performance diagnostics. Across both UK and US datasets, MARBLE consistently outperforms traditional machine learning classifiers and state-of-the-art (SOTA) prompt-based reasoning methods including Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Least-to-Most (L2M), and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) achieving nearly 90% accuracy where others plateau below 48%. This performance redefines the practical ceiling for accident severity classification under real world noise and extreme class imbalance. Our results position MARBLE as a generalizable and interpretable framework for reasoning under uncertainty in safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Surgical action planning requires predicting future instrument-verb-target triplets for real-time assistance. While teleoperated robotic surgery provides natural expert demonstrations for imitation learning (IL), reinforcement learning (RL) could potentially discover superior strategies through exploration. We present the first comprehensive comparison of IL versus RL for surgical action planning on CholecT50. Our Dual-task Autoregressive Imitation Learning (DARIL) baseline achieves 34.6% action triplet recognition mAP and 33.6% next frame prediction mAP with smooth planning degradation to 29.2% at 10-second horizons. We evaluated three RL variants: world model-based RL, direct video RL, and inverse RL enhancement. Surprisingly, all RL approaches underperformed DARIL i.e. world model RL dropped to 3.1% mAP at 10s while direct video RL achieved only 15.9%. Our analysis reveals that distribution matching on expert-annotated test sets systematically favors IL over potentially valid RL policies that differ from training demonstrations. This challenges assumptions about RL superiority in sequential decision making and provides crucial insights for surgical AI development.

Abstract: Pearl observes that causal knowledge enables predicting the effects of interventions, such as actions, whereas descriptive knowledge only permits drawing conclusions from observation. This paper extends Pearl's approach to causality and interventions to the setting of stratified abductive logic programs. It shows how stable models of such programs can be given a causal interpretation by building on philosophical foundations and recent work by Bochman and Eelink et al. In particular, it provides a translation of abductive logic programs into causal systems, thereby clarifying the informal causal reading of logic program rules and supporting principled reasoning about external actions. The main result establishes that the stable model semantics for stratified programs conforms to key philosophical principles of causation, such as causal sufficiency, natural necessity, and irrelevance of unobserved effects. This justifies the use of stratified abductive logic programs as a framework for causal modeling and for predicting the effects of interventions

<title>Rule Learning for Knowledge Graph Reasoning under Agnostic Distribution Shift</title>

Abstract: Knowledge graph (KG) reasoning remains a critical research area focused on inferring missing knowledge by analyzing relationships among observed facts. Despite its success, a key limitation of existing KG reasoning methods is their dependence on the I.I.D assumption. This assumption can easily be violated due to unknown sample selection bias during training or agnostic distribution shifts during testing, significantly compromising model performance and reliability. To facilitate the deployment of KG reasoning in wild environments, this study investigates learning logical rules from KGs affected by unknown selection bias. Additionally, we address test sets with agnostic distribution shifts, formally defining this challenge as out-of-distribution (OOD) KG reasoning-a previously underexplored problem. To solve the issue, we propose the Stable Rule Learning (StableRule) framework, an end-to-end methodology that integrates feature decorrelation with rule learning network, to enhance OOD generalization performance. By leveraging feature decorrelation, the StableRule framework mitigates the adverse effects of covariate shifts arising in OOD scenarios, thereby improving the robustness of the rule learning component in effectively deriving logical rules. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark KGs demonstrate the framework's superior effectiveness and stability across diverse heterogeneous environments, underscoring its practical significance for real-world applications.

<title>GIST: Cross-Domain Click-Through Rate Prediction via Guided Content-Behavior Distillation</title>

Abstract: Cross-domain Click-Through Rate prediction aims to tackle the data sparsity and the cold start problems in online advertising systems by transferring knowledge from source domains to a target domain. Most existing methods rely on overlapping users to facilitate this transfer, often focusing on joint training or pre-training with fine-tuning approach to connect the source and target domains. However, in real-world industrial settings, joint training struggles to learn optimal representations with different distributions, and pre-training with fine-tuning is not well-suited for continuously integrating new data. To address these issues, we propose GIST, a cross-domain lifelong sequence model that decouples the training processes of the source and target domains. Unlike previous methods that search lifelong sequences in the source domains using only content or behavior signals or their simple combinations, we innovatively introduce a Content-Behavior Joint Training Module (CBJT), which aligns content-behavior distributions and combines them with guided information to facilitate a more stable representation. Furthermore, we develop an Asymmetric Similarity Integration strategy (ASI) to augment knowledge transfer through similarity computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GIST, surpassing SOTA methods on offline evaluations and an online A/B test. Deployed on the Xiaohongshu (RedNote) platform, GIST effectively enhances online ads system performance at scale, serving hundreds of millions of daily active users.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has significant potential in healthcare applications, but its training and deployment faces challenges due to healthcare's diverse data, complex tasks, and the need to preserve privacy. Foundation models that perform well on medical tasks and require less task-specific tuning data are critical to accelerate the development of healthcare AI applications. We introduce MedGemma, a collection of medical vision-language foundation models based on Gemma 3 4B and 27B. MedGemma demonstrates advanced medical understanding and reasoning on images and text, significantly exceeding the performance of similar-sized generative models and approaching the performance of task-specific models, while maintaining the general capabilities of the Gemma 3 base models. For out-of-distribution tasks, MedGemma achieves 2.6-10% improvement on medical multimodal question answering, 15.5-18.1% improvement on chest X-ray finding classification, and 10.8% improvement on agentic evaluations compared to the base models. Fine-tuning MedGemma further improves performance in subdomains, reducing errors in electronic health record information retrieval by 50% and reaching comparable performance to existing specialized state-of-the-art methods for pneumothorax classification and histopathology patch classification. We additionally introduce MedSigLIP, a medically-tuned vision encoder derived from SigLIP. MedSigLIP powers the visual understanding capabilities of MedGemma and as an encoder achieves comparable or better performance than specialized medical image encoders. Taken together, the MedGemma collection provides a strong foundation of medical image and text capabilities, with potential to significantly accelerate medical research and development of downstream applications. The MedGemma collection, including tutorials and model weights, can be found at https://goo.gle/medgemma.

Abstract: The rapid advancements of AI agents have ignited the long-held ambition of leveraging them to accelerate scientific discovery. Achieving this goal requires a deep understanding of the frontiers of human knowledge. As such, Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) provides an exceptionally challenging touchstone for evaluating scientific AI agents. In this work, we aim to construct the foundational architecture for general-purpose agents and validate the capabilities through leading performance on HLE. To achieve this, we introduce X-Master, a tool-augmented reasoning agent designed to emulate human researchers by interacting flexibly with external tools during its reasoning process. This agent, guided by the conceptualization of code as an interaction language, can flexibly leverage built-in Python libraries and our customized tools to augment the reasoning. We further scale its capabilities through X-Masters, a scattered-and-stacked agentic workflow that systematically enhances breadth and depth of reasoning. Our open-source solution, X-Masters, sets a new state-of-the-art record on HLE with a score of 32.1%, surpassing OpenAI's and Google's Deep Research (26.6% and 26.9%) and becoming the first to exceed the 30% threshold. This work allows us to gain a deeper understanding of complex task-solving and accumulates valuable experience that can inform future advancements, guiding subsequent model training.

<title>Modeling Latent Partner Strategies for Adaptive Zero-Shot Human-Agent Collaboration</title>

Abstract: In collaborative tasks, being able to adapt to your teammates is a necessary requirement for success. When teammates are heterogeneous, such as in human-agent teams, agents need to be able to observe, recognize, and adapt to their human partners in real time. This becomes particularly challenging in tasks with time pressure and complex strategic spaces where the dynamics can change rapidly. In this work, we introduce TALENTS, a strategy-conditioned cooperator framework that learns to represent, categorize, and adapt to a range of partner strategies, enabling ad-hoc teamwork. Our approach utilizes a variational autoencoder to learn a latent strategy space from trajectory data. This latent space represents the underlying strategies that agents employ. Subsequently, the system identifies different types of strategy by clustering the data. Finally, a cooperator agent is trained to generate partners for each type of strategy, conditioned on these clusters. In order to adapt to previously unseen partners, we leverage a fixed-share regret minimization algorithm that infers and adjusts the estimated partner strategy dynamically. We assess our approach in a customized version of the Overcooked environment, posing a challenging cooperative cooking task that demands strong coordination across a wide range of possible strategies. Using an online user study, we show that our agent outperforms current baselines when working with unfamiliar human partners.

<title>When Chain of Thought is Necessary, Language Models Struggle to Evade Monitors</title>

Abstract: While chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring is an appealing AI safety defense, recent work on "unfaithfulness" has cast doubt on its reliability. These findings highlight an important failure mode, particularly when CoT acts as a post-hoc rationalization in applications like auditing for bias. However, for the distinct problem of runtime monitoring to prevent severe harm, we argue the key property is not faithfulness but monitorability. To this end, we introduce a conceptual framework distinguishing CoT-as-rationalization from CoT-as-computation. We expect that certain classes of severe harm will require complex, multi-step reasoning that necessitates CoT-as-computation. Replicating the experimental setups of prior work, we increase the difficulty of the bad behavior to enforce this necessity condition; this forces the model to expose its reasoning, making it monitorable. We then present methodology guidelines to stress-test CoT monitoring against deliberate evasion. Applying these guidelines, we find that models can learn to obscure their intentions, but only when given significant help, such as detailed human-written strategies or iterative optimization against the monitor. We conclude that, while not infallible, CoT monitoring offers a substantial layer of defense that requires active protection and continued stress-testing.

Abstract: This study explores how Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning, guided by human aesthetic evaluations, can enhance the outputs of generative AI models in tangible product design, using lamp design as a case study. By integrating human feedback into the AI model, we aim to improve both the desirability and aesthetic appeal of the generated designs. Comprehensive experiments were conducted, starting with prompt optimization techniques and focusing on LoRA fine-tuning of the Stable Diffusion model. Additionally, methods to convert AI-generated designs into tangible products through 3D realization using 3D printing technologies were investigated. The results indicate that LoRA fine-tuning effectively aligns AI-generated designs with human aesthetic preferences, leading to significant improvements in desirability and aesthetic appeal scores. These findings highlight the potential of human-AI collaboration in tangible product design and provide valuable insights into integrating human feedback into AI design processes.

Abstract: The high computational cost and power consumption of current and anticipated AI systems present a major challenge for widespread deployment and further scaling. Current hardware approaches face fundamental efficiency limits. This paper introduces ZettaLith, a scalable computing architecture designed to reduce the cost and power of AI inference by over 1,000x compared to current GPU-based systems. Based on architectural analysis and technology projections, a single ZettaLith rack could potentially achieve 1.507 zettaFLOPS in 2027 - representing a theoretical 1,047x improvement in inference performance, 1,490x better power efficiency, and could be 2,325x more cost-effective than current leading GPU racks for FP4 transformer inference. The ZettaLith architecture achieves these gains by abandoning general purpose GPU applications, and via the multiplicative effect of numerous co-designed architectural innovations using established digital electronic technologies, as detailed in this paper. ZettaLith's core architectural principles scale down efficiently to exaFLOPS desktop systems and petaFLOPS mobile chips, maintaining their roughly 1,000x advantage. ZettaLith presents a simpler system architecture compared to the complex hierarchy of current GPU clusters. ZettaLith is optimized exclusively for AI inference and is not applicable for AI training.

<title>Lightweight LSTM Model for Energy Theft Detection via Input Data Reduction</title>

Abstract: With the increasing integration of smart meters in electrical grids worldwide, detecting energy theft has become a critical and ongoing challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based models have demonstrated strong performance in identifying fraudulent consumption patterns; however, previous works exploring the use of machine learning solutions for this problem demand high computational and energy costs, limiting their practicality -- particularly in low-theft scenarios where continuous inference can result in unnecessary energy usage. This paper proposes a lightweight detection unit, or watchdog mechanism, designed to act as a pre-filter that determines when to activate a long short-term memory (LSTM) model. This mechanism reduces the volume of input fed to the LSTM model, limiting it to instances that are more likely to involve energy theft thereby preserving detection accuracy while substantially reducing energy consumption associated with continuous model execution. The proposed system was evaluated through simulations across six scenarios with varying theft severity and number of active thieves. Results indicate a power consumption reduction exceeding 64\%, with minimal loss in detection accuracy and consistently high recall. These findings support the feasibility of a more energy-efficient and scalable approach to energy theft detection in smart grids. In contrast to prior work that increases model complexity to achieve marginal accuracy gains, this study emphasizes practical deployment considerations such as inference efficiency and system scalability. The results highlight the potential for deploying sustainable, AI-assisted monitoring systems within modern smart grid infrastructures.

Abstract: The philosophy of mathematical practice (PMP) looks to evidence from working mathematics to help settle philosophical questions. One prominent program under the PMP banner is the study of explanation in mathematics, which aims to understand what sorts of proofs mathematicians consider explanatory and what role the pursuit of explanation plays in mathematical practice. In an effort to address worries about cherry-picked examples and file-drawer problems in PMP, a handful of authors have recently turned to corpus analysis methods as a promising alternative to small-scale case studies. This paper reports the results from such a corpus study facilitated by Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro, a model whose reasoning capabilities, advances in hallucination control and large context window allow for the accurate analysis of hundreds of pages of text per query. Based on a sample of 5000 mathematics papers from arXiv.org, the experiments yielded a dataset of hundreds of useful annotated examples. Its aim was to gain insight on questions like the following: How often do mathematicians make claims about explanation in the relevant sense? Do mathematicians' explanatory practices vary in any noticeable way by subject matter? Which philosophical theories of explanation are most consistent with a large body of non-cherry-picked examples? How might philosophers make further use of AI tools to gain insights from large datasets of this kind? As the first PMP study making extensive use of LLM methods, it also seeks to begin a conversation about these methods as research tools in practice-oriented philosophy and to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of current models for such work.

Abstract: Circular genome visualizations are essential for exploring structural variants and gene regulation. However, existing tools often require complex scripting and manual configuration, making the process time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to learn. To address these challenges, we introduce AuraGenome, an LLM-powered framework for rapid, reusable, and scalable generation of multi-layered circular genome visualizations. AuraGenome combines a semantic-driven multi-agent workflow with an interactive visual analytics system. The workflow employs seven specialized LLM-driven agents, each assigned distinct roles such as intent recognition, layout planning, and code generation, to transform raw genomic data into tailored visualizations. The system supports multiple coordinated views tailored for genomic data, offering ring, radial, and chord-based layouts to represent multi-layered circular genome visualizations. In addition to enabling interactions and configuration reuse, the system supports real-time refinement and high-quality report export. We validate its effectiveness through two case studies and a comprehensive user study. AuraGenome is available at: https://github.com/Darius18/AuraGenome.

Abstract: Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) are a key tool for addressing costly optimization tasks, with their efficiency being heavily dependent on the selection of surrogate models and infill sampling criteria. However, designing an effective dynamic selection strategy for SAEAs is labor-intensive and requires substantial domain knowledge. To address this challenge, this paper proposes LLM-SAEA, a novel approach that integrates large language models (LLMs) to configure both surrogate models and infill sampling criteria online. Specifically, LLM-SAEA develops a collaboration-of-experts framework, where one LLM serves as a scoring expert (LLM-SE), assigning scores to surrogate models and infill sampling criteria based on their optimization performance, while another LLM acts as a decision expert (LLM-DE), selecting the appropriate configurations by analyzing their scores along with the current optimization state. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-SAEA outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms across standard test cases. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/ForrestXie9/LLM-SAEA.

Abstract: This paper discusses how particle swarm optimization (PSO) can be used to generate quantum circuits to solve an instance of the MaxOne problem. It then analyzes previous studies on evolutionary algorithms for circuit synthesis. With a brief introduction to PSO, including its parameters and algorithm flow, the paper focuses on a method of quantum circuit encoding and representation as PSO parameters. The fitness evaluation used in this paper is the MaxOne problem. The paper presents experimental results that compare different learning abilities and inertia weight variations in the PSO algorithm. A comparison is further made between the PSO algorithm and a genetic algorithm for quantum circuit synthesis. The results suggest PSO converges more quickly to the optimal solution.

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recent years has also given rise to the development of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). These new MLLMs allow us to process images, videos and even audio alongside textual inputs. In this project, we aim to assess the effectiveness of MLLMs in analysing sports videos, focusing mainly on tennis videos. Despite research done on tennis analysis, there remains a gap in models that are able to understand and identify the sequence of events in a tennis rally, which would be useful in other fields of sports analytics. As such, we will mainly assess the MLLMs on their ability to fill this gap - to classify tennis actions, as well as their ability to identify these actions in a sequence of tennis actions in a rally. We further looked into ways we can improve the MLLMs' performance, including different training methods and even using them together with other traditional models.

<title>Preference-Optimal Multi-Metric Weighting for Parallel Coordinate Plots</title>

Abstract: Parallel coordinate plots (PCPs) are a prevalent method to interpret the relationship between the control parameters and metrics. PCPs deliver such an interpretation by color gradation based on a single metric. However, it is challenging to provide such a gradation when multiple metrics are present. Although a naive approach involves calculating a single metric by linearly weighting each metric, such weighting is unclear for users. To address this problem, we first propose a principled formulation for calculating the optimal weight based on a specific preferred metric combination. Although users can simply select their preference from a two-dimensional (2D) plane for bi-metric problems, multi-metric problems require intuitive visualization to allow them to select their preference. We achieved this using various radar charts to visualize the metric trade-offs on the 2D plane reduced by UMAP. In the analysis using pedestrian flow guidance planning, our method identified unique patterns of control parameter importance for each user preference, highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

<title>Hyperbolic Kernel Graph Neural Networks for Neurocognitive Decline Analysis from Multimodal Brain Imaging</title>

Abstract: Multimodal neuroimages, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), offer complementary perspectives on brain activities by capturing structural or functional interactions among brain regions. While existing studies suggest that fusing these multimodal data helps detect abnormal brain activity caused by neurocognitive decline, they are generally implemented in Euclidean space and can't effectively capture intrinsic hierarchical organization of structural/functional brain networks. This paper presents a hyperbolic kernel graph fusion (HKGF) framework for neurocognitive decline analysis with multimodal neuroimages. It consists of a multimodal graph construction module, a graph representation learning module that encodes brain graphs in hyperbolic space through a family of hyperbolic kernel graph neural networks (HKGNNs), a cross-modality coupling module that enables effective multimodal data fusion, and a hyperbolic neural network for downstream predictions. Notably, HKGNNs represent graphs in hyperbolic space to capture both local and global dependencies among brain regions while preserving the hierarchical structure of brain networks. Extensive experiments involving over 4,000 subjects with DTI and/or fMRI data suggest the superiority of HKGF over state-of-the-art methods in two neurocognitive decline prediction tasks. HKGF is a general framework for multimodal data analysis, facilitating objective quantification of structural/functional brain connectivity changes associated with neurocognitive decline.

Abstract: Designing effective task sequences is crucial for curriculum reinforcement learning (CRL), where agents must gradually acquire skills by training on intermediate tasks. A key challenge in CRL is to identify tasks that promote exploration, yet are similar enough to support effective transfer. While recent approach suggests comparing tasks via their Structural Causal Models (SCMs), the method requires access to ground-truth causal structures, an unrealistic assumption in most RL settings. In this work, we propose Causal-Paced Deep Reinforcement Learning (CP-DRL), a curriculum learning framework aware of SCM differences between tasks based on interaction data approximation. This signal captures task novelty, which we combine with the agent's learnability, measured by reward gain, to form a unified objective. Empirically, CP-DRL outperforms existing curriculum methods on the Point Mass benchmark, achieving faster convergence and higher returns. CP-DRL demonstrates reduced variance with comparable final returns in the Bipedal Walker-Trivial setting, and achieves the highest average performance in the Infeasible variant. These results indicate that leveraging causal relationships between tasks can improve the structure-awareness and sample efficiency of curriculum reinforcement learning. We provide the full implementation of CP-DRL to facilitate the reproduction of our main results at https://github.com/Cho-Geonwoo/CP-DRL.

Abstract: We introduce DiceHuBERT, a knowledge distillation framework for compressing HuBERT, a widely used self-supervised learning (SSL)-based speech foundation model. Unlike existing distillation methods that rely on layer-wise and feature-wise mapping between teacher and student models, DiceHuBERT leverages HuBERT's iterative self-distillation mechanism by directly replacing the original model with a student model. This replacement allows the student to be trained using the same SSL objective used when pre-training HuBERT, eliminating the need for additional modules or architectural constraints. Experimental results on SUPERB show that DiceHuBERT consistently outperforms existing distillation methods, improving phoneme recognition performance by over 21% and ASR performance by more than 14%. Furthermore, DiceHuBERT demonstrates competitive performance across multiple tasks, highlighting its clear advantage.

Abstract: This study proposes an analytical framework that integrates DBSCAN clustering with the Elastic Net regression model to address multifactorial problems characterized by structural complexity and multicollinearity, exemplified by carbon emissions analysis. DBSCAN is employed for unsupervised learning to objectively cluster features, while the Elastic Net is utilized for high-dimensional feature selection and complexity control. The Elastic Net is specifically chosen for its ability to balance feature selection and regularization by combining L1 (lasso) and L2 (ridge) penalties, making it particularly suited for datasets with correlated predictors. Applying this framework to energy consumption data from 46 industries in China (2000-2019) resulted in the identification of 16 categories. Emission characteristics and drivers were quantitatively assessed for each category, demonstrating the framework's capacity to identify primary emission sources and provide actionable insights. This research underscores the global applicability of the framework for analyzing complex regional challenges, such as carbon emissions, and highlights qualitative features that humans find meaningful may not be accurate for the model.

Abstract: Many e-learning platforms assert their ability or potential to improve students' self-regulated learning (SRL), however the cyclical and undirected nature of SRL theoretical models represent significant challenges for representation within contemporary machine learning frameworks. We apply SRL-informed features to trace data in order to advance modelling of students' SRL activities, to improve predictability and explainability regarding the causal effects of learning in an eLearning environment. We demonstrate that these features improve predictive accuracy and validate the value of further research into cyclic modelling techniques for SRL.

Audio-JEPA uses a simple Vision Transformer backbone to predict latent representations of masked spectrogram patches rather than reconstructing raw audio. We pre-train on unlabeled AudioSet clips (10s, 32kHz) with random patch masking on mel-spectrograms. We evaluate on the X-ARES suite covering speech, music, and environmental sound tasks. Although our implementation is a straightforward translation of the original model to audio, the results still show comparable performance to wav2vec 2.0 and data2vec while using less than one-fifth of their training data and with no hyper-parameter tuning. All code and pretrained checkpoints will be released on GitHub.

Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as essential components in safety-critical applications -- these use cases demand complex, yet trustworthy computations. Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) are a type of neural network where each neuron is constrained to a Boolean value; they are particularly well-suited for safety-critical tasks because they retain much of the computational capacities of full-scale (floating-point or quantized) deep neural networks, but remain compatible with satisfiability solvers for qualitative verification and with model counters for quantitative reasoning. However, existing methods for BNN analysis suffer from either limited scalability or susceptibility to soundness errors, which hinders their applicability in real-world scenarios.
  In this work, we present a scalable and trustworthy approach for both qualitative and quantitative verification of BNNs. Our approach introduces a native representation of BNN constraints in a custom-designed solver for qualitative reasoning, and in an approximate model counter for quantitative reasoning. We further develop specialized proof generation and checking pipelines with native support for BNN constraint reasoning, ensuring trustworthiness for all of our verification results. Empirical evaluations on a BNN robustness verification benchmark suite demonstrate that our certified solving approach achieves a $9\times$ speedup over prior certified CNF and PB-based approaches, and our certified counting approach achieves a $218\times$ speedup over the existing CNF-based baseline. In terms of coverage, our pipeline produces fully certified results for $99\%$ and $86\%$ of the qualitative and quantitative reasoning queries on BNNs, respectively. This is in sharp contrast to the best existing baselines which can fully certify only $62\%$ and $4\%$ of the queries, respectively.

<title>Echo State Transformer: When chaos brings memory</title>

Abstract: While Large Language Models and their underlying Transformer architecture are remarkably efficient, they do not reflect how our brain processes and learns a diversity of cognitive tasks such as language and working memory. Furthermore, sequential data processing with Transformers encounters a fundamental barrier: quadratic complexity growth with sequence length. Motivated by these limitations, our ambition is to create more efficient models that are less reliant on intensive computations and massive volumes of data. We introduce Echo State Transformers (EST), a hybrid architecture that elegantly resolves this challenge while demonstrating exceptional performance in low-data regimes. EST integrates the Transformer attention mechanisms with principles from Reservoir Computing to create a fixedsize window distributed memory system. Drawing inspiration from Echo State Networks, the most prominent instance of the Reservoir Computing paradigm, our architecture integrates a new module called ''Working Memory'' based on several reservoirs (i.e. random recurrent networks) working in parallel. These reservoirs work as independent memory units with distinct internal dynamics. A novelty here is that the classical reservoir hyperparameters controlling the dynamics are now trained. Thus, the EST dynamically adapts the memory/non-linearity trade-off in reservoirs. By maintaining a fixed number of memory units regardless of sequence length, EST achieves constant computational complexity at each processing step, effectively breaking the quadratic scaling problem of standard Transformers. Evaluations on the STREAM benchmark, which comprises 12 diverse sequential processing tasks, demonstrate that EST outperforms GRUs, LSTMs, and even Transformers on 8 of these tasks. These findings highlight that Echo State Transformers can be an effective replacement to GRUs and LSTMs while complementing standard Transformers at least on resource-constrained environments and low-data scenarios across diverse sequential processing tasks.

Abstract: Healthcare professionals need effective ways to use, understand, and validate AI-driven clinical decision support systems. Existing systems face two key limitations: complex visualizations and a lack of grounding in scientific evidence. We present an integrated decision support system that combines interactive visualizations with a conversational agent to explain diabetes risk assessments. We propose a hybrid prompt handling approach combining fine-tuned language models for analytical queries with general Large Language Models (LLMs) for broader medical questions, a methodology for grounding AI explanations in scientific evidence, and a feature range analysis technique to support deeper understanding of feature contributions. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 30 healthcare professionals and found that the conversational interactions helped healthcare professionals build a clear understanding of model assessments, while the integration of scientific evidence calibrated trust in the system's decisions. Most participants reported that the system supported both patient risk evaluation and recommendation.

Abstract: Spatial structure is central to effective geospatial intelligence systems. While foundation models have shown promise, they often lack the flexibility to reason about places, which are context-rich regions spanning different spatial granularities. We propose PlaceFM, a spatial foundation model that captures place representations using a training-free graph condensation method. PlaceFM condenses a nationwide POI graph built from integrated Foursquare and OpenStreetMap data in the U.S., generating general-purpose embeddings of places. These embeddings can be seamlessly integrated into geolocation data pipelines to support a wide range of downstream tasks. Without requiring pretraining, PlaceFM offers a scalable and adaptable solution for multi-scale geospatial analysis.

Abstract: Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs) have emerged as a crucial paradigm in recent years, extending the capabilities of traditional LLMs to speech tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and spoken dialogue modeling. However, their effectiveness in real-world multilingual conversations remains limited by the scarcity of data that captures natural conversational phenomena. To address this, the MLC-SLM Challenge provides a multilingual conversational dataset and evaluates models on two tasks: ASR with oracle segmentation (Task I) and joint diarization and recognition without oracle information (Task II). In this paper, we focus on Task II and propose a unified speech LLM that jointly performs diarization and ASR in an end-to-end manner. By reformulating the training data format and modifying the inference procedure, our model addresses the ambiguity inherent in pre-segmented audio and achieves a 54.87\% relative improvement in tcpWER/tcpCER over the baseline, ranking 8th overall, despite using a smaller LLM backbone. We also report results from Task I using a fine-tuned speech LLM.

Abstract: Hidden confounding remains a central challenge in estimating treatment effects from observational data, as unobserved variables can lead to biased causal estimates. While recent work has explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for causal inference, most approaches still rely on the unconfoundedness assumption. In this paper, we make the first attempt to mitigate hidden confounding using LLMs. We propose ProCI (Progressive Confounder Imputation), a framework that elicits the semantic and world knowledge of LLMs to iteratively generate, impute, and validate hidden confounders. ProCI leverages two key capabilities of LLMs: their strong semantic reasoning ability, which enables the discovery of plausible confounders from both structured and unstructured inputs, and their embedded world knowledge, which supports counterfactual reasoning under latent confounding. To improve robustness, ProCI adopts a distributional reasoning strategy instead of direct value imputation to prevent the collapsed outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ProCI uncovers meaningful confounders and significantly improves treatment effect estimation across various datasets and LLMs.

Abstract: We present the Object-Based Sub-Environment Recognition (OBSER) framework, a novel Bayesian framework that infers three fundamental relationships between sub-environments and their constituent objects. In the OBSER framework, metric and self-supervised learning models estimate the object distributions of sub-environments on the latent space to compute these measures. Both theoretically and empirically, we validate the proposed framework by introducing the ($\epsilon,\delta$) statistically separable (EDS) function which indicates the alignment of the representation. Our framework reliably performs inference in open-world and photorealistic environments and outperforms scene-based methods in chained retrieval tasks. The OBSER framework enables zero-shot recognition of environments to achieve autonomous environment understanding.

<title>MolProphecy: Bridging Medicinal Chemists' Knowledge and Molecular Pre-Trained Models via a Multi-Modal Framework</title>

arXiv:2507.02932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MolProphecy is a human-in-the-loop (HITL) multi-modal framework designed to integrate chemists' domain knowledge into molecular property prediction models. While molecular pre-trained models have enabled significant gains in predictive accuracy, they often fail to capture the tacit, interpretive reasoning central to expert-driven molecular design. To address this, MolProphecy employs ChatGPT as a virtual chemist to simulate expert-level reasoning and decision-making. The generated chemist knowledge is embedded by the large language model (LLM) as a dedicated knowledge representation and then fused with graph-based molecular features through a gated cross-attention mechanism, enabling joint reasoning over human-derived and structural features. Evaluated on four benchmark datasets (FreeSolv, BACE, SIDER, and ClinTox), MolProphecy outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, achieving a 15.0 percent reduction in RMSE on FreeSolv and a 5.39 percent improvement in AUROC on BACE. Analysis reveals that chemist knowledge and structural features provide complementary contributions, improving both accuracy and interpretability. MolProphecy offers a practical and generalizable approach for collaborative drug discovery, with the flexibility to incorporate real chemist input in place of the current simulated proxy--without the need for model retraining. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/zhangruochi/MolProphecy.

Abstract: This paper explores the possibility of determining the weights and thresholds of a neural network using the potential -- a parameter of an electrostatic field -- without analytical calculations and without applying training algorithms. The work is based on neural network architectures employing metric recognition methods. The electrostatic field is simulated in the Builder C++ environment. In the same environment, a neural network based on metric recognition methods is constructed, with the weights of the first-layer neurons determined by the values of the potentials of the simulated electrostatic field. The effectiveness of the resulting neural network within the simulated system is evaluated using the MNIST test dataset under various initial conditions of the simulated system. The results demonstrated functional viability. The implementation of this approach shows that a neural network can obtain weight values almost instantaneously from the electrostatic field, without the need for analytical computations, lengthy training procedures, or massive training datasets.

Abstract: The Theory of Mind (ToM) refers to an agent's capacity to infer the mental states of other agents. ToM is essential for effective collaboration. To assess ToM in a dynamic, goal-oriented, and collaborative environment, we introduce a novel task, Instruction Inference, in which an agent assists a principal in reaching a goal by interpreting indirect or ambiguous instructions. We present Tomcat, an LLM-based agent, designed to exhibit ToM reasoning in interpreting and responding to the principal's instructions. We implement two variants of Tomcat. One, dubbed Fs-CoT, is based on a small number of examples (i.e., few-shot or Fs) demonstrating the requisite structured reasoning (i.e., chain-of-thought or CoT). One, dubbed CP, relies on commonsense knowledge and information about the problem (i.e., commonsense prompt or CP). We realized both variants of Tomcat on three leading large language models (LLMs), namely, GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and Gemma-3-27B. To evaluate the effectiveness of Tomcat, we conducted a study with 52 human participants in which we provided participants with the same information as the CP variant of Tomcat. We computed intent accuracy, action optimality, and planning optimality to measure the ToM capabilities of Tomcat and our study participants. We found that Tomcat with Fs-CoT, particularly with GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1, achieves performance comparable to the human participants, underscoring its ToM potential for human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Recent results show that modern Large Language Models (LLM) are indeed capable of understanding and answering questions about structured data such as graphs. This new paradigm can lead to solutions that require less supervision while, at the same time, providing a model that can generalize and answer questions beyond the training labels. Existing proposals often use some description of the graph to create an ``augmented'' prompt fed to the LLM. For a chosen class of graphs, if a well-tailored graph encoder is deployed to play together with a pre-trained LLM, the model can answer graph-related questions well. Existing solutions to graph-based prompts range from graph serialization to graph transformers. In this work, we show that the use of a parameter-free graph encoder based on Fock space representations, a concept borrowed from mathematical physics, is remarkably versatile in this problem setting. The simple construction, inherited directly from the theory with a few small adjustments, can provide rich and informative graph encodings, for a wide range of different graphs. We investigate the use of this idea for prefix-tuned prompts leveraging the capabilities of a pre-trained, frozen LLM. The modifications lead to a model that can answer graph-related questions -- from simple graphs to proteins to hypergraphs -- effectively and with minimal, if any, adjustments to the architecture. Our work significantly simplifies existing solutions and generalizes well to multiple different graph-based structures effortlessly.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across diverse open-domain tasks, yet their application in specialized domains such as civil engineering remains largely unexplored. This paper starts bridging this gap by evaluating and enhancing the reliability and robustness of LLMs in structural analysis of beams. Reliability is assessed through the accuracy of correct outputs under repetitive runs of the same problems, whereas robustness is evaluated via the performance across varying load and boundary conditions. A benchmark dataset, comprising eight beam analysis problems, is created to test the Llama-3.3 70B Instruct model. Results show that, despite a qualitative understanding of structural mechanics, the LLM lacks the quantitative reliability and robustness for engineering applications. To address these limitations, a shift is proposed that reframes the structural analysis as code generation tasks. Accordingly, an LLM-empowered agent is developed that (a) integrates chain-of-thought and few-shot prompting to generate accurate OpeeSeesPy code, and (b) automatically executes the code to produce structural analysis results. Experimental results demonstrate that the agent achieves accuracy exceeding 99.0% on the benchmark dataset, exhibiting reliable and robust performance across diverse conditions. Ablation studies highlight the complete example and function usage examples as the primary contributors to the agent's enhanced performance.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting tasks, such as traffic flow, combustion dynamics, and weather forecasting, often require complex models that suffer from low training efficiency and high memory consumption. This paper proposes a lightweight framework, Spectral Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (termed SDKD), which transfers the multi-scale spatiotemporal representations from a complex teacher model to a more efficient lightweight student network. The teacher model follows an encoder-latent evolution-decoder architecture, where its latent evolution module decouples high-frequency details and low-frequency trends using convolution and Transformer (global low-frequency modeler). However, the multi-layer convolution and deconvolution structures result in slow training and high memory usage. To address these issues, we propose a frequency-aligned knowledge distillation strategy, which extracts multi-scale spectral features from the teacher's latent space, including both high and low frequency components, to guide the lightweight student model in capturing both local fine-grained variations and global evolution patterns. Experimental results show that SDKD significantly improves performance, achieving reductions of up to 81.3% in MSE and in MAE 52.3% on the Navier-Stokes equation dataset. The framework effectively captures both high-frequency variations and long-term trends while reducing computational complexity. Our codes are available at https://github.com/itsnotacie/SDKD

Abstract: The DisCoCirc framework for natural language processing allows the construction of compositional models of text, by combining units for individual words together according to the grammatical structure of the text. The compositional nature of a model can give rise to two things: compositional generalisation -- the ability of a model to generalise outside its training distribution by learning compositional rules underpinning the entire data distribution -- and compositional interpretability -- making sense of how the model works by inspecting its modular components in isolation, as well as the processes through which these components are combined. We present these notions in a framework-agnostic way using the language of category theory, and adapt a series of tests for compositional generalisation to this setting.
  Applying this to the DisCoCirc framework, we consider how well a selection of models can learn to compositionally generalise. We compare both quantum circuit based models, as well as classical neural networks, on a dataset derived from one of the bAbI tasks, extended to test a series of aspects of compositionality. Both architectures score within 5% of one another on the productivity and substitutivity tasks, but differ by at least 10% for the systematicity task, and exhibit different trends on the overgeneralisation tasks. Overall, we find the neural models are more prone to overfitting the Train data. Additionally, we demonstrate how to interpret a compositional model on one of the trained models. By considering how the model components interact with one another, we explain how the model behaves.

Abstract: GameTileNet is a dataset designed to provide semantic labels for low-resolution digital game art, advancing procedural content generation (PCG) and related AI research as a vision-language alignment task. Large Language Models (LLMs) and image-generative AI models have enabled indie developers to create visual assets, such as sprites, for game interactions. However, generating visuals that align with game narratives remains challenging due to inconsistent AI outputs, requiring manual adjustments by human artists. The diversity of visual representations in automatically generated game content is also limited because of the imbalance in distributions across styles for training data. GameTileNet addresses this by collecting artist-created game tiles from OpenGameArt.org under Creative Commons licenses and providing semantic annotations to support narrative-driven content generation. The dataset introduces a pipeline for object detection in low-resolution tile-based game art (e.g., 32x32 pixels) and annotates semantics, connectivity, and object classifications. GameTileNet is a valuable resource for improving PCG methods, supporting narrative-rich game content, and establishing a baseline for object detection in low-resolution, non-photorealistic images.
  TL;DR: GameTileNet is a semantic dataset of low-resolution game tiles designed to support narrative-driven procedural content generation through visual-language alignment.

Abstract: Perception-related tasks often arise in autonomous systems operating under partial observability. This work studies the problem of synthesizing optimal policies for complex perception-related objectives in environments modeled by partially observable Markov decision processes. To formally specify such objectives, we introduce \emph{co-safe linear inequality temporal logic} (sc-iLTL), which can define complex tasks that are formed by the logical concatenation of atomic propositions as linear inequalities on the belief space of the POMDPs. Our solution to the control synthesis problem is to transform the \mbox{sc-iLTL} objectives into reachability objectives by constructing the product of the belief MDP and a deterministic finite automaton built from the sc-iLTL objective. To overcome the scalability challenge due to the product, we introduce a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) method that converges in probability to the optimal policy. Finally, a drone-probing case study demonstrates the applicability of our method.

Abstract: While deep spiking neural networks (SNNs) demonstrate superior performance, their deployment on resource-constrained neuromorphic hardware still remains challenging. Network pruning offers a viable solution by reducing both parameters and synaptic operations (SynOps) to facilitate the edge deployment of SNNs, among which search-based pruning methods search for the SNNs structure after pruning. However, existing search-based methods fail to directly use SynOps as the constraint because it will dynamically change in the searching process, resulting in the final searched network violating the expected SynOps target. In this paper, we introduce a novel SNN pruning framework called SPEAR, which leverages reinforcement learning (RL) technique to directly use SynOps as the searching constraint. To avoid the violation of SynOps requirements, we first propose a SynOps prediction mechanism called LRE to accurately predict the final SynOps after search. Observing SynOps cannot be explicitly calculated and added to constrain the action in RL, we propose a novel reward called TAR to stabilize the searching. Extensive experiments show that our SPEAR framework can effectively compress SNN under specific SynOps constraint.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in video understanding tasks. However, they continue to struggle with long-form videos because of an inefficient perception of temporal intervals. Unlike humans, who can dynamically adjust their temporal focus to locate query-relevant moments, current MLLMs often rely on dense, uniform sampling across the video timeline, leading to high memory consumption and a risk of missing crucial information. To address this challenge, we introduce Temporal Search, a training-free framework that enables MLLMs to explore temporal regions for improved long video understanding iteratively. TS is based on a key observation: the model's generation confidence across different temporal intervals is highly correlated with prediction accuracy. TS operates through two main iterative stages. First, the MLLM proposes a temporal interval that is likely to contain task-relevant information. Then, it samples a fixed number of frames from the interval, regardless of length, and feeds them into the model to produce a refined response and confidence score. TS refines the focus of the model by iteratively shifting attention to more fine-grained temporal intervals, improving its understanding of long videos. Additionally, keyframe-level descriptions are collected to facilitate cross-interval perception throughout the video. To further improve efficiency, we introduce TS-BFS, a best-first search strategy over a tree. Each node represents a candidate interval and is expanded via two methods: self-driven proposals and uniform partitioning. Nodes are scored based on confidence and self-evaluation, and the most promising one is selected for continued exploration.

Abstract: Autonomous driving has seen significant progress, driven by extensive real-world data. However, in long-tail scenarios, accurately predicting the safety of the ego vehicle's future motion remains a major challenge due to uncertainties in dynamic environments and limitations in data coverage. In this work, we aim to explore whether it is possible to enhance the motion risk prediction capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLM) by synthesizing high-risk motion data. Specifically, we introduce a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) based motion simulation method to model risks from three aspects: the ego-vehicle, other vehicles, and the environment. This allows us to synthesize plug-and-play, high-risk motion data suitable for VLM training, which we call DriveMRP-10K. Furthermore, we design a VLM-agnostic motion risk estimation framework, named DriveMRP-Agent. This framework incorporates a novel information injection strategy for global context, ego-vehicle perspective, and trajectory projection, enabling VLMs to effectively reason about the spatial relationships between motion waypoints and the environment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by fine-tuning with DriveMRP-10K, our DriveMRP-Agent framework can significantly improve the motion risk prediction performance of multiple VLM baselines, with the accident recognition accuracy soaring from 27.13% to 88.03%. Moreover, when tested via zero-shot evaluation on an in-house real-world high-risk motion dataset, DriveMRP-Agent achieves a significant performance leap, boosting the accuracy from base_model's 29.42% to 68.50%, which showcases the strong generalization capabilities of our method in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of large language model (LLM) performance across three counseling roles in Japanese-language therapeutic contexts. We simultaneously assessed counselor artificial intelligence (AI) systems (GPT-4-turbo with zeroshot prompting or Structured Multi-step Dialogue Prompts (SMDP), Claude-3-Opus-SMDP), client AI simulations, and evaluation AI systems (o3, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, Gemini-2.5-pro). Human experts (n = 15) with extensive counseling experience evaluated AI-generated dialogues using the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) Coding Manual 4.2.1.
  Notably, SMDP implementation significantly enhanced counselor AI performance across all MITI global ratings compared with zeroshot prompting, with no significant differences between GPT-SMDP and Opus-SMDP. Evaluation AIs showed comparable performance to human raters for Cultivating Change Talk but systematically overestimated Softening Sustain Talk and the overall quality metrics. Model-specific biases emerged: Gemini emphasized power-sharing, o3 focused on technical proficiency, and Sonnet prioritized emotional expression. Client AI simulations exhibited a limited emotional range and unnaturally high compliance, indicating the need for enhanced realism.
  These findings establish benchmarks for AI-assisted counseling in non-English contexts and identify critical areas for improvement through advanced prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation, and targeted fine-tuning, with important implications for developing culturally sensitive AI mental health tools.

Abstract: This paper investigates whether Bittensor can be considered the Bitcoin of decentralized Artificial Intelligence by directly comparing its tokenomics, decentralization properties, consensus mechanism, and incentive structure against those of Bitcoin. Leveraging on-chain data from all 64 active Bittensor subnets, we first document considerable concentration in both stake and rewards. We further show that rewards are overwhelmingly driven by stake, highlighting a clear misalignment between quality and compensation. As a remedy, we put forward a series of two-pronged protocol-level interventions. For incentive realignment, our proposed solutions include performance-weighted emission split, composite scoring, and a trust-bonus multiplier. As for mitigating security vulnerability due to stake concentration, we propose and empirically validate stake cap at the 88th percentile, which elevates the median coalition size required for a 51-percent attack and remains robust across daily, weekly, and monthly snapshots.

Abstract: We investigate various strategic locations of shops in shopping malls in a metropolis with the aim of finding the best strategy for final dominance of market share by a company in a competing environment. The problem is posed in the context of two competing supermarket chains in a metropolis, described in the framework of the two-dimensional Ising model. Evolutionary Algorithm is used to encode the ensemble of initial configurations and Monte Carlo method is used to evolve the pattern. Numerical simulation indicates that initial patterns with certain topological properties do evolve faster to market dominance. The description of these topological properties is given and suggestions are made on the initial pattern so as to evolve faster to market dominance.

Abstract: As financial institutions increasingly adopt Large Language Models (LLMs), rigorous domain-specific evaluation becomes critical for responsible deployment. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark evaluating 23 state-of-the-art LLMs on the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) Level III exam - the gold standard for advanced financial reasoning. We assess both multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and essay-style responses using multiple prompting strategies including Chain-of-Thought and Self-Discover. Our evaluation reveals that leading models demonstrate strong capabilities, with composite scores such as 79.1% (o4-mini) and 77.3% (Gemini 2.5 Flash) on CFA Level III. These results, achieved under a revised, stricter essay grading methodology, indicate significant progress in LLM capabilities for high-stakes financial applications. Our findings provide crucial guidance for practitioners on model selection and highlight remaining challenges in cost-effective deployment and the need for nuanced interpretation of performance against professional benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent research has demonstrated that state-of-the-art LLMs and defenses remain susceptible to multi-turn jailbreak attacks. These attacks require only closed-box model access and are often easy to perform manually, posing a significant threat to the safe and secure deployment of LLM-based systems. We study the effectiveness of the Crescendo multi-turn jailbreak at the level of intermediate model representations and find that safety-aligned LMs often represent Crescendo responses as more benign than harmful, especially as the number of conversation turns increases. Our analysis indicates that at each turn, Crescendo prompts tend to keep model outputs in a "benign" region of representation space, effectively tricking the model into fulfilling harmful requests. Further, our results help explain why single-turn jailbreak defenses like circuit breakers are generally ineffective against multi-turn attacks, motivating the development of mitigations that address this generalization gap.

<title>A Novel Active Learning Approach to Label One Million Unknown Malware Variants</title>

Abstract: Active learning for classification seeks to reduce the cost of labeling samples by finding unlabeled examples about which the current model is least certain and sending them to an annotator/expert to label. Bayesian theory can provide a probabilistic view of deep neural network models by asserting a prior distribution over model parameters and estimating the uncertainties by posterior distribution over these parameters. This paper proposes two novel active learning approaches to label one million malware examples belonging to different unknown modern malware families. The first model is Inception-V4+PCA combined with several support vector machine (SVM) algorithms (UTSVM, PSVM, SVM-GSU, TBSVM). The second model is Vision Transformer based Bayesian Neural Networks ViT-BNN. Our proposed ViT-BNN is a state-of-the-art active learning approach that differs from current methods and can apply to any particular task. The experiments demonstrate that the ViT-BNN is more stable and robust in handling uncertainty.

<title>Optimization of Low-Latency Spiking Neural Networks Utilizing Historical Dynamics of Refractory Periods</title>

Abstract: The refractory period controls neuron spike firing rate, crucial for network stability and noise resistance. With advancements in spiking neural network (SNN) training methods, low-latency SNN applications have expanded. In low-latency SNNs, shorter simulation steps render traditional refractory mechanisms, which rely on empirical distributions or spike firing rates, less effective. However, omitting the refractory period amplifies the risk of neuron over-activation and reduces the system's robustness to noise. To address this challenge, we propose a historical dynamic refractory period (HDRP) model that leverages membrane potential derivative with historical refractory periods to estimate an initial refractory period and dynamically adjust its duration. Additionally, we propose a threshold-dependent refractory kernel to mitigate excessive neuron state accumulation. Our approach retains the binary characteristics of SNNs while enhancing both noise resistance and overall performance. Experimental results show that HDRP-SNN significantly reduces redundant spikes compared to traditional SNNs, and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy both on static datasets and neuromorphic datasets. Moreover, HDRP-SNN outperforms artificial neural networks (ANNs) and traditional SNNs in noise resistance, highlighting the crucial role of the HDRP mechanism in enhancing the performance of low-latency SNNs.

Abstract: Modern transportation network modeling increasingly involves the integration of diverse methodologies including sensor-based forecasting, reinforcement learning, classical flow optimization, and demand modeling that have traditionally been developed in isolation. This paper introduces Flow Through Tensors (FTT), a unified computational graph architecture that connects origin destination flows, path probabilities, and link travel times as interconnected tensors. Our framework makes three key contributions: first, it establishes a consistent mathematical structure that enables gradient-based optimization across previously separate modeling elements; second, it supports multidimensional analysis of traffic patterns over time, space, and user groups with precise quantification of system efficiency; third, it implements tensor decomposition techniques that maintain computational tractability for large scale applications. These innovations collectively enable real time control strategies, efficient coordination between multiple transportation modes and operators, and rigorous enforcement of physical network constraints. The FTT framework bridges the gap between theoretical transportation models and practical deployment needs, providing a foundation for next generation integrated mobility systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, while they remain prone to generating hallucinated or outdated responses due to their static internal knowledge. Recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have explored enhancing models' search and reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL). Although these methods demonstrate promising results, they face challenges in training stability and encounter issues such as substantial inference time and restricted capabilities due to the single-query mode. In this paper, we propose RAG-R1, a novel training framework designed to enable LLMs to adaptively leverage internal and external knowledge during the reasoning process. We further expand the generation and retrieval processes within the framework from single-query mode to multi-query parallelism, aimed at reducing inference time and enhancing the model's capabilities. Extensive experiments on seven question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the strongest baseline by up to 13.2% and decreases inference time by 11.1%.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional natural language capabilities, general-purpose models lack specialized domain knowledge for effective cybersecurity analysis. In this work, we investigate Domain-Adaptive Continuous Pretraining (DAP) as a methodology for enhancing cybersecurity understanding in pretrained LLMs while preserving general language capabilities. We systematically adapted three decoder-based architectures -- Llama-3.1-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct -- using a curated 126-million-word cybersecurity corpus from standards, academic literature, and various other sources. Our approach employed constrained training parameters and distributed FSDP training to balance domain specialization with knowledge preservation. Evaluation across three cybersecurity benchmarks, namely, CTI-MCQ, CyberMetric, and SecEval, demonstrates consistent improvements post-adaptation. The Llama-3.3-70B-Ins-DAP model achieved state-of-the-art accuracies of 0.718, 0.933, and 0.864, respectively, outperforming specialized models, including Llama-Primus-Base. Notably, competitive performance was achieved using substantially smaller datasets (118.8 million versus 2.77 billion tokens), demonstrating efficient domain specialization viability. We establish that targeted continuous pretraining enables effective cybersecurity domain adaptation with computational feasibility, providing foundations for specialized AI assistants in threat analysis, vulnerability assessment, and security documentation while challenging prevailing assumptions about data requirements for LLM specialization.

<title>Concept-based Adversarial Attack: a Probabilistic Perspective</title>

Abstract: We propose a concept-based adversarial attack framework that extends beyond single-image perturbations by adopting a probabilistic perspective. Rather than modifying a single image, our method operates on an entire concept -- represented by a probabilistic generative model or a set of images -- to generate diverse adversarial examples. Preserving the concept is essential, as it ensures that the resulting adversarial images remain identifiable as instances of the original underlying category or identity. By sampling from this concept-based adversarial distribution, we generate images that maintain the original concept but vary in pose, viewpoint, or background, thereby misleading the classifier. Mathematically, this framework remains consistent with traditional adversarial attacks in a principled manner. Our theoretical and empirical results demonstrate that concept-based adversarial attacks yield more diverse adversarial examples and effectively preserve the underlying concept, while achieving higher attack efficiency.

Abstract: The use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in high-stakes AI-based applications has increased significantly in recent years, especially since the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, despite their strong performance, LLMs introduce important legal/ethical concerns, particularly regarding privacy, data protection, and transparency. Due to these concerns, this work explores the use of Named-Entity Recognition (NER) to facilitate the privacy-preserving training (or adaptation) of LLMs. We propose a framework that uses NER technologies to anonymize sensitive information in text data, such as personal identities or geographic locations. An evaluation of the proposed privacy-preserving learning framework was conducted to measure its impact on user privacy and system performance in a particular high-stakes and sensitive setup: AI-based resume scoring for recruitment processes. The study involved two language models (BERT and RoBERTa) and six anonymization algorithms (based on Presidio, FLAIR, BERT, and different versions of GPT) applied to a database of 24,000 candidate profiles. The findings indicate that the proposed privacy preservation techniques effectively maintain system performance while playing a critical role in safeguarding candidate confidentiality, thus promoting trust in the experimented scenario. On top of the proposed privacy-preserving approach, we also experiment applying an existing approach that reduces the gender bias in LLMs, thus finally obtaining our proposed Privacy- and Bias-aware LLMs (PB-LLMs). Note that the proposed PB-LLMs have been evaluated in a particular setup (resume scoring), but are generally applicable to any other LLM-based AI application.

Abstract: Condition monitoring subsea pipelines in low-visibility underwater environments poses significant challenges due to turbidity, light distortion, and image degradation. Traditional visual-based inspection systems often fail to provide reliable data for mapping, object recognition, or defect detection in such conditions. This study explores the integration of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to enhance image quality, detect pipeline structures, and support autonomous fault diagnosis. This study conducts a comparative analysis of two most robust versions of YOLOv8 and Yolov11 and their three variants tailored for image segmentation tasks in complex and low-visibility subsea environments. Using pipeline inspection datasets captured beneath the seabed, it evaluates model performance in accurately delineating target structures under challenging visual conditions. The results indicated that YOLOv11 outperformed YOLOv8 in overall performance.

Abstract: Privacy policy documents are often lengthy, complex, and difficult for non-expert users to interpret, leading to a lack of transparency regarding the collection, processing, and sharing of personal data. As concerns over online privacy grow, it is essential to develop automated tools capable of analyzing privacy policies and identifying potential risks. In this study, we explore the potential of interactive graph visualizations to enhance user understanding of privacy policies by representing policy terms as structured graph models. This approach makes complex relationships more accessible and enables users to make informed decisions about their personal data (RQ1). We also employ graph mining algorithms to identify key themes, such as User Activity and Device Information, using dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE and PCA to assess clustering effectiveness. Our findings reveal that graph-based clustering improves policy content interpretability. It highlights patterns in user tracking and data sharing, which supports forensic investigations and identifies regulatory non-compliance. This research advances AI-driven tools for auditing privacy policies by integrating interactive visualizations with graph mining. Enhanced transparency fosters accountability and trust.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for transforming digital health by enabling automated medical question answering. However, ensuring these models meet critical industry standards for factual accuracy, usefulness, and safety remains a challenge, especially for open-source solutions. We present a rigorous benchmarking framework using a dataset of over 1,000 health questions. We assess model performance across honesty, helpfulness, and harmlessness. Our results highlight trade-offs between factual reliability and safety among evaluated models -- Mistral-7B, BioMistral-7B-DARE, and AlpaCare-13B. AlpaCare-13B achieves the highest accuracy (91.7%) and harmlessness (0.92), while domain-specific tuning in BioMistral-7B-DARE boosts safety (0.90) despite its smaller scale. Few-shot prompting improves accuracy from 78% to 85%, and all models show reduced helpfulness on complex queries, highlighting ongoing challenges in clinical QA.

Abstract: Multimodal learning faces a fundamental tension between deep, fine-grained fusion and computational scalability. While cross-attention models achieve strong performance through exhaustive pairwise fusion, their quadratic complexity is prohibitive for settings with many modalities. We address this challenge with Gated Recurrent Fusion (GRF), a novel architecture that captures the power of cross-modal attention within a linearly scalable, recurrent pipeline. Our method processes modalities sequentially, updating an evolving multimodal context vector at each step. The core of our approach is a fusion block built on Transformer Decoder layers that performs symmetric cross-attention, mutually enriching the shared context and the incoming modality. This enriched information is then integrated via a Gated Fusion Unit (GFU) a GRU-inspired mechanism that dynamically arbitrates information flow, enabling the model to selectively retain or discard features. This stateful, recurrent design scales linearly with the number of modalities, O(n), making it ideal for high-modality environments. Experiments on the CMU-MOSI benchmark demonstrate that GRF achieves competitive performance compared to more complex baselines. Visualizations of the embedding space further illustrate that GRF creates structured, class-separable representations through its progressive fusion mechanism. Our work presents a robust and efficient paradigm for powerful, scalable multimodal representation learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to increasingly sophisticated safety protocols and features designed to prevent harmful, unethical, or unauthorized outputs. However, these guardrails remain susceptible to novel and creative forms of adversarial prompting, including manually generated test cases. In this work, we present two new test cases in mental health for (i) suicide and (ii) self-harm, using multi-step, prompt-level jailbreaking and bypass built-in content and safety filters. We show that user intent is disregarded, leading to the generation of detailed harmful content and instructions that could cause real-world harm. We conduct an empirical evaluation across six widely available LLMs, demonstrating the generalizability and reliability of the bypass. We assess these findings and the multilayered ethical tensions that they present for their implications on prompt-response filtering and context- and task-specific model development. We recommend a more comprehensive and systematic approach to AI safety and ethics while emphasizing the need for continuous adversarial testing in safety-critical AI deployments. We also argue that while certain clearly defined safety measures and guardrails can and must be implemented in LLMs, ensuring robust and comprehensive safety across all use cases and domains remains extremely challenging given the current technical maturity of general-purpose LLMs.

Abstract: Learning to perform activities through demonstration requires extracting meaningful information about the environment from observations. In this research, we investigate the challenge of planning high-level goal-oriented actions in a simulation setting from an egocentric perspective. We present a novel task, interactive action planning, and propose an approach that combines topological affordance memory with transformer architecture. The process of memorizing the environment's structure through extracting affordances facilitates selecting appropriate actions based on the context. Moreover, the memory model allows us to detect action deviations while accomplishing specific objectives. To assess the method's versatility, we evaluate it in a realistic interactive simulation environment. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach learns meaningful representations, resulting in improved performance and robust when action deviations occur.

Abstract: This study evaluates how well large language models (LLMs) can classify ICD-10 codes from hospital discharge summaries, a critical but error-prone task in healthcare. Using 1,500 summaries from the MIMIC-IV dataset and focusing on the 10 most frequent ICD-10 codes, the study tested 11 LLMs, including models with and without structured reasoning capabilities. Medical terms were extracted using a clinical NLP tool (cTAKES), and models were prompted in a consistent, coder-like format. None of the models achieved an F1 score above 57%, with performance dropping as code specificity increased. Reasoning-based models generally outperformed non-reasoning ones, with Gemini 2.5 Pro performing best overall. Some codes, such as those related to chronic heart disease, were classified more accurately than others. The findings suggest that while LLMs can assist human coders, they are not yet reliable enough for full automation. Future work should explore hybrid methods, domain-specific model training, and the use of structured clinical data.

In this context, connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology emerges as a promising avenue for effectively managing such interactions while ensuring safety and efficiency. Traditional approaches, often grounded in game theory assumptions of perfect rationality, may inadequately capture the complexities of real-world scenarios and drivers' decision-making errors. To fill this gap, we propose a novel decision-making model for vehicle unprotected left-turn scenarios, integrating game theory with considerations for drivers' bounded rationality. Our model, formulated as a two-player normal-form game solved by a quantal response equilibrium (QRE), offers a more nuanced depiction of driver decision-making processes compared to Nash equilibrium (NE) models. Leveraging an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm coupled with a subtle neural network trained on precise microscopic vehicle trajectory data, we optimize model parameters to accurately reflect drivers' interaction-aware bounded rationality and driving styles. Through comprehensive simulation experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed model in capturing the interaction-aware bounded rationality and decision tendencies between players. The proposed model proves to be more realistic and efficient than NE models in unprotected left-turn scenarios. Our findings contribute valuable insights into the vehicle decision-making behaviors with bounded rationality, thereby informing the development of more robust and realistic autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: The rapid integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in education requires teachers to develop AI competencies while preparing students for a society influenced by AI. This study evaluates the impact of an online teacher training program on German in-service teachers' AI literacy, usage behaviors, and attitudes toward AI. A pre-post design study was conducted with teachers (N1 = 291 for AI literacy, N2 = 436 for attitude assessment) participating in the course. The program combined synchronous and asynchronous learning formats, including webinars, self-paced modules, and practical projects. The participants exhibited notable improvements across all domains: AI literacy scores increased significantly, and all attitude items regarding AI usage and integration demonstrated significant positive changes. Teachers reported increased confidence in AI integration. Structured teacher training programs effectively enhance AI literacy and foster positive attitudes toward AI in education.

Abstract: Generative AI systems have rapidly advanced, with multimodal input capabilities enabling reasoning beyond text-based tasks. In education, these advancements could influence assessment design and question answering, presenting both opportunities and challenges. To investigate these effects, we introduce a high-quality dataset of 201 university-level STEM questions, manually annotated with features such as image type, role, problem complexity, and question format. Our study analyzes how these features affect generative AI performance compared to students. We evaluate four model families with five prompting strategies, comparing results to the average of 546 student responses per question. Although the best model correctly answers on average 58.5 % of the questions using majority vote aggregation, human participants consistently outperform AI on questions involving visual components. Interestingly, human performance remains stable across question features but varies by subject, whereas AI performance is susceptible to both subject matter and question features. Finally, we provide actionable insights for educators, demonstrating how question design can enhance academic integrity by leveraging features that challenge current AI systems without increasing the cognitive burden for students.

Abstract: We explore applying a tensor completion approach to complete the DrugMatrix toxicogenomics dataset. Our hypothesis is that by preserving the 3-dimensional structure of the data, which comprises tissue, treatment, and transcriptomic measurements, and by leveraging a machine learning formulation, our approach will improve upon prior state-of-the-art results. Our results demonstrate that the new tensor-based method more accurately reflects the original data distribution and effectively captures organ-specific variability. The proposed tensor-based methodology achieved lower mean squared errors and mean absolute errors compared to both conventional Canonical Polyadic decomposition and 2-dimensional matrix factorization methods. In addition, our non-negative tensor completion implementation reveals relationships among tissues. Our findings not only complete the world's largest in-vivo toxicogenomics database with improved accuracy but also offer a promising methodology for future studies of drugs that may cross species barriers, for example, from rats to humans.

Abstract: Transfer learning in Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to leverage knowledge from source tasks to accelerate learning in target tasks. While prior work, such as the Attend, Adapt, and Transfer (A2T) framework, addresses negative transfer and selective transfer, other critical challenges remain underexplored. This paper introduces the Generalized Adaptive Transfer Network (GATN), a deep RL architecture designed to tackle task generalization across domains, robustness to environmental changes, and computational efficiency in transfer. GATN employs a domain-agnostic representation module, a robustness-aware policy adapter, and an efficient transfer scheduler to achieve these goals. We evaluate GATN on diverse benchmarks, including Atari 2600, MuJoCo, and a custom chatbot dialogue environment, demonstrating superior performance in cross-domain generalization, resilience to dynamic environments, and reduced computational overhead compared to baselines. Our findings suggest GATN is a versatile framework for real-world RL applications, such as adaptive chatbots and robotic control.

Abstract: This study employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast key performance indicators (KPIs), Occupancy (OCC), Average Daily Rate (ADR), and Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR), across five major cities: Manchester, Amsterdam, Dubai, Bangkok, and Mumbai. The cities were selected for their diverse economic profiles and hospitality dynamics. Monthly data from 2018 to 2025 were used, with 80% for training and 20% for testing. Advanced time series decomposition and machine learning techniques enabled accurate forecasting and trend identification. Results show that Manchester and Mumbai exhibited the highest predictive accuracy, reflecting stable demand patterns, while Dubai and Bangkok demonstrated higher variability due to seasonal and event-driven influences. The findings validate the effectiveness of LSTM models for urban hospitality forecasting and provide a comparative framework for data-driven decision-making. The models generalisability across global cities highlights its potential utility for tourism stakeholders and urban planners.

<title>On the Mathematical Impossibility of Safe Universal Approximators</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.03031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish fundamental mathematical limits on universal approximation theorem (UAT) system alignment by proving that catastrophic failures are an inescapable feature of any useful computational system. Our central thesis is that for any universal approximator, the expressive power required for useful computation is inextricably linked to a dense set of instabilities that make perfect, reliable control a mathematical impossibility. We prove this through a three-level argument that leaves no escape routes for any class of universal approximator architecture. i) Combinatorial Necessity: For the vast majority of practical universal approximators (e.g., those using ReLU activations), we prove that the density of catastrophic failure points is directly proportional to the network's expressive power. ii) Topological Necessity: For any theoretical universal approximator, we use singularity theory to prove that the ability to approximate generic functions requires the ability to implement the dense, catastrophic singularities that characterize them. iii) Empirical Necessity: We prove that the universal existence of adversarial examples is empirical evidence that real-world tasks are themselves catastrophic, forcing any successful model to learn and replicate these instabilities. These results, combined with a quantitative "Impossibility Sandwich" showing that the minimum complexity for usefulness exceeds the maximum complexity for safety, demonstrate that perfect alignment is not an engineering challenge but a mathematical impossibility. This foundational result reframes UAT safety from a problem of "how to achieve perfect control" to one of "how to operate safely in the presence of irreducible uncontrollability," with profound implications for the future of UAT development and governance.

Abstract: Background: Clinical documentation represents a significant burden for healthcare providers, with physicians spending up to 2 hours daily on administrative tasks. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer promising solutions, but privacy concerns and computational requirements limit their adoption in healthcare settings. Objective: To develop and evaluate a privacy-preserving, on-device medical transcription system using a fine-tuned Llama 3.2 1B model capable of generating structured medical notes from medical transcriptions while maintaining complete data sovereignty entirely in the browser. Methods: We fine-tuned a Llama 3.2 1B model using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA on 1,500 synthetic medical transcription-to-structured note pairs. The model was evaluated against the base Llama 3.2 1B on two datasets: 100 endocrinology transcripts and 140 modified ACI benchmark cases. Evaluation employed both statistical metrics (ROUGE, BERTScore, BLEURT) and LLM-as-judge assessments across multiple clinical quality dimensions. Results: The fine-tuned OnDevice model demonstrated substantial improvements over the base model. On the ACI benchmark, ROUGE-1 scores increased from 0.346 to 0.496, while BERTScore F1 improved from 0.832 to 0.866. Clinical quality assessments showed marked reduction in major hallucinations (from 85 to 35 cases) and enhanced factual correctness (2.81 to 3.54 on 5-point scale). Similar improvements were observed on the internal evaluation dataset, with composite scores increasing from 3.13 to 4.43 (+41.5%). Conclusions: Fine-tuning compact LLMs for medical transcription yields clinically meaningful improvements while enabling complete on-device browser deployment. This approach addresses key barriers to AI adoption in healthcare: privacy preservation, cost reduction, and accessibility for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: The (generative) artificial intelligence (AI) era has profoundly reshaped the meaning and value of data. No longer confined to static content, data now permeates every stage of the AI lifecycle from the training samples that shape model parameters to the prompts and outputs that drive real-world model deployment. This shift renders traditional notions of data protection insufficient, while the boundaries of what needs safeguarding remain poorly defined. Failing to safeguard data in AI systems can inflict societal and individual, underscoring the urgent need to clearly delineate the scope of and rigorously enforce data protection. In this perspective, we propose a four-level taxonomy, including non-usability, privacy preservation, traceability, and deletability, that captures the diverse protection needs arising in modern (generative) AI models and systems. Our framework offers a structured understanding of the trade-offs between data utility and control, spanning the entire AI pipeline, including training datasets, model weights, system prompts, and AI-generated content. We analyze representative technical approaches at each level and reveal regulatory blind spots that leave critical assets exposed. By offering a structured lens to align future AI technologies and governance with trustworthy data practices, we underscore the urgency of rethinking data protection for modern AI techniques and provide timely guidance for developers, researchers, and regulators alike.

Abstract: High-dimensional and incomplete (HDI) data, characterized by massive node interactions, have become ubiquitous across various real-world applications. Second-order latent factor models have shown promising performance in modeling this type of data. Nevertheless, due to the bilinear and non-convex nature of the SLF model's objective function, incorporating a damping term into the Hessian approximation and carefully tuning associated parameters become essential. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new approach in this study, named the adaptive cubic regularized second-order latent factor analysis (ACRSLF) model. The proposed ACRSLF adopts the two-fold ideas: 1) self-tuning cubic regularization that dynamically mitigates non-convex optimization instabilities; 2) multi-Hessian-vector product evaluation during conjugate gradient iterations for precise second-order information assimilation. Comprehensive experiments on two industrial HDI datasets demonstrate that the ACRSLF converges faster and achieves higher representation accuracy than the advancing optimizer-based LFA models.

Abstract: Next token prediction paradigm has been prevailing for autoregressive models in the era of LLMs. The current default sampling choice for popular LLMs is temperature scaling together with nucleus sampling to balance diversity and coherence. Nevertheless, such approach leads to inferior performance in various NLP tasks when the model is not certain about testing questions. To this end, we propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next Token Prediction (CNTP). In the decoding process, if the model has comparatively high prediction entropy at a certain step, we sample multiple trials starting from the step independently and stop when encountering any punctuation. Then we select the trial with the lowest perplexity score viewed as the most probable and reliable trial path given the model's capacity. The trial number is negatively correlated with the prediction confidence, i.e., the less confident the model is, the more trials it should sample. This is consistent with human beings' behaviour: when feeling uncertain or unconfident, one tends to think more creatively, exploring multiple thinking paths, to cautiously select the path one feels most confident about. Extensive experiments on both LLMs and MLLMs show that our proposed CNTP approach outperforms existing standard decoding strategies consistently by a clear margin. Moreover, the integration of CNTP with self consistency can further improve over vanilla self consistency. We believe our proposed CNTP has the potential to become one of the default choices for LLM decoding. Code is available at https://github.com/wyzjack/CNTP.

<title>Optimas: Optimizing Compound AI Systems with Globally Aligned Local Rewards</title>

Abstract: Compound AI systems integrating multiple components, such as Large Language Models, specialized tools, and traditional machine learning models, are increasingly deployed to solve complex real-world tasks. However, optimizing compound systems remains challenging due to their non-differentiable structures and diverse configuration types across components, including prompts, hyperparameters, and model parameters. To address this challenge, we propose Optimas, a unified framework for effective optimization of compound systems. The core idea of Optimas is to maintain one Local Reward Function (LRF) per component, each satisfying a local-global alignment property, i.e., each component's local reward correlates with the global system performance. In each iteration, Optimas efficiently adapts the LRFs to maintain this property while simultaneously maximizing each component's local reward. This approach enables independent updates of heterogeneous configurations using the designated optimization method, while ensuring that local improvements consistently lead to performance gains. We present extensive evaluations across five real-world compound systems to demonstrate that Optimas outperforms strong baselines by an average improvement of 11.92%, offering a general and effective approach for improving compound systems.

Abstract: Memory storage for Large Language models (LLMs) is becoming an increasingly active area of research, particularly for enabling personalization across long conversations. We propose Pref-LSTM, a dynamic and lightweight framework that combines a BERT-based classifier with a LSTM memory module that generates memory embedding which then is soft-prompt injected into a frozen LLM. We synthetically curate a dataset of preference and non-preference conversation turns to train our BERT-based classifier. Although our LSTM-based memory encoder did not yield strong results, we find that the BERT-based classifier performs reliably in identifying explicit and implicit user preferences. Our research demonstrates the viability of using preference filtering with LSTM gating principals as an efficient path towards scalable user preference modeling, without extensive overhead and fine-tuning.

Abstract: Early evaluation of children's language is frustrated by the high pitch, long phones, and sparse data that derail automatic speech recognisers. We introduce K-Function, a unified framework that combines accurate sub-word transcription, objective scoring, and actionable feedback. Its core, Kids-WFST, merges a Wav2Vec2 phoneme encoder with a phoneme-similarity Dysfluent-WFST to capture child-specific errors while remaining fully interpretable. Kids-WFST attains 1.39% phoneme error on MyST and 8.61% on Multitudes--absolute gains of 10.47 and 7.06 points over a greedy-search decoder. These high-fidelity transcripts power an LLM that grades verbal skills, milestones, reading, and comprehension, aligning with human proctors and supplying tongue-and-lip visualizations plus targeted advice. The results show that precise phoneme recognition cements a complete diagnostic-feedback loop, paving the way for scalable, clinician-ready language assessment.

Abstract: The Artificial Intelligence field has focused on developing optimisation methods to solve multiple problems, specifically problems that we thought to be only solvable through cognition. The obtained results have been outstanding, being able to even surpass the Turing Test. However, we have found that these optimisation methods share some fundamental flaws that impede them to become a true artificial cognition. Specifically, the field have identified catastrophic forgetting as a fundamental problem to develop such cognition. This paper formally proves that this problem is inherent to optimisation methods, and as such it will always limit approaches that try to solve the Artificial General Intelligence problem as an optimisation problem. Additionally, it addresses the problem of overfitting and discuss about other smaller problems that optimisation methods pose. Finally, it empirically shows how world-modelling methods avoid suffering from either problem. As a conclusion, the field of Artificial Intelligence needs to look outside the machine learning field to find methods capable of developing an artificial cognition.

<title>Counterfactual Tuning for Temporal Sensitivity Enhancement in Large Language Model-based Recommendation</title>

Abstract: Recent advances have applied large language models (LLMs) to sequential recommendation, leveraging their pre-training knowledge and reasoning capabilities to provide more personalized user experiences. However, existing LLM-based methods fail to sufficiently leverage the rich temporal information inherent in users' historical interaction sequences, stemming from fundamental architectural constraints: LLMs process information through self-attention mechanisms that lack inherent sequence ordering and rely on position embeddings designed primarily for natural language rather than user interaction sequences. This limitation significantly impairs their ability to capture the evolution of user preferences over time and predict future interests accurately.
  To address this critical gap, we propose Counterfactual Enhanced Temporal Framework for LLM-Based Recommendation (CETRec). CETRec is grounded in causal inference principles, which allow it to isolate and measure the specific impact of temporal information on recommendation outcomes. By conceptualizing temporal order as an independent causal factor distinct from item content, we can quantify its unique contribution through counterfactual reasoning--comparing what recommendations would be made with and without temporal information while keeping all other factors constant. This causal framing enables CETRec to design a novel counterfactual tuning objective that directly optimizes the model's temporal sensitivity, teaching LLMs to recognize both absolute timestamps and relative ordering patterns in user histories. Combined with our counterfactual tuning task derived from causal analysis, CETRec effectively enhances LLMs' awareness of both absolute order (how recently items were interacted with) and relative order (the sequential relationships between items).

Abstract: Machine-learned systems are in widespread use for making decisions about humans, and it is important that they are fair, i.e., not biased against individuals based on sensitive attributes.
  We present a general framework of runtime verification of algorithmic fairness for systems whose models are unknown, but are assumed to have a Markov chain structure, with or without full observation of the state space.
  We introduce a specification language that can model many common algorithmic fairness properties, such as demographic parity, equal opportunity, and social burden.
  We build monitors that observe a long sequence of events as generated by a given system, and output, after each observation, a quantitative estimate of how fair or biased the system was on that run until that point in time.
  The estimate is proven to be correct modulo a variable error bound and a given confidence level, where the error bound gets tighter as the observed sequence gets longer.
  We present two categories of monitoring algorithms, namely ones with a uniform error bound across all time points, and ones with weaker non-uniform, pointwise error bounds at different time points.
  Our monitoring algorithms use statistical tools that are adapted to suit the dynamic requirements of monitoring and the special needs of the fairness specifications.
  Using a prototype implementation, we show how we can monitor if a bank is fair in giving loans to applicants from different social backgrounds, and if a college is fair in admitting students while maintaining a reasonable financial burden on the society.
  In these experiments, our monitors took less than a millisecond to update their verdicts after each observation.

Abstract: In the field of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), a fundamental challenge is to facilitate human understanding of robots. The emerging domain of eXplainable HRI (XHRI) investigates methods to generate explanations and evaluate their impact on human-robot interactions. Previous works have highlighted the need to personalise the level of detail of these explanations to enhance usability and comprehension. Our paper presents a framework designed to update and retrieve user knowledge-memory models, allowing for adapting the explanations' level of detail while referencing previously acquired concepts. Three architectures based on our proposed framework that use Large Language Models (LLMs) are evaluated in two distinct scenarios: a hospital patrolling robot and a kitchen assistant robot. Experimental results demonstrate that a two-stage architecture, which first generates an explanation and then personalises it, is the framework architecture that effectively reduces the level of detail only when there is related user knowledge.

<title>From Turing to Tomorrow: The UK's Approach to AI Regulation</title>

Abstract: The UK has pursued a distinctive path in AI regulation: less cautious than the EU but more willing to address risks than the US, and has emerged as a global leader in coordinating AI safety efforts. Impressive developments from companies like London-based DeepMind began to spark concerns in the UK about catastrophic risks from around 2012, although regulatory discussion at the time focussed on bias and discrimination. By 2022, these discussions had evolved into a "pro-innovation" strategy, in which the government directed existing regulators to take a light-touch approach, governing AI at point of use, but avoided regulating the technology or infrastructure directly. ChatGPT arrived in late 2022, galvanising concerns that this approach may be insufficient. The UK responded by establishing an AI Safety Institute to monitor risks and hosting the first international AI Safety Summit in 2023, but - unlike the EU - refrained from regulating frontier AI development in addition to its use. A new government was elected in 2024 which promised to address this gap, but at the time of writing is yet to do so.
  What should the UK do next? The government faces competing objectives: harnessing AI for economic growth and better public services while mitigating risk. In light of these, we propose establishing a flexible, principles-based regulator to oversee the most advanced AI development, defensive measures against risks from AI-enabled biological design tools, and argue that more technical work is needed to understand how to respond to AI-generated misinformation. We argue for updated legal frameworks on copyright, discrimination, and AI agents, and that regulators will have a limited but important role if AI substantially disrupts labour markets.
  If the UK gets AI regulation right, it could demonstrate how democratic societies can harness AI's benefits while managing its risks.

<title>Improving LLM Reasoning for Vulnerability Detection via Group Relative Policy Optimization</title>

Abstract: Improving and understanding the training dynamics and reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become essential for their deployment in AI-based security tools, such as software vulnerability detection. In this work, we present an extensive study aimed at advancing recent RL-based finetuning techniques for LLMs in the context of vulnerability detection.
  We start by highlighting key limitations of commonly adopted LLMs, such as their tendency to over-predict certain types of vulnerabilities while failing to detect others. To address this challenge, we explore the use of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent policy-gradient method, for guiding LLM behavior through structured, rule-based rewards. We enable its application to the vulnerability detection task by redefining its advantage functions and reward signals using annotations from widely used datasets in the field, including BigVul, DiverseVul, and CleanVul.
  The proposed methodology enables an extensive set of experiments, addressing multiple research questions regarding the impact of GRPO on generalization, reasoning capabilities, and performance improvements over standard supervised finetuning (SFT). Our findings offer valuable insights into the potential of RL-based training to enhance both the performance and reasoning abilities of LLMs in the context of software vulnerability detection.

<title>From 2:4 to 8:16 sparsity patterns in LLMs for Outliers and Weights with Variance Correction</title>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in size, efficient compression techniques like quantization and sparsification are critical. While quantization maintains performance with reduced precision, structured sparsity methods, such as N:M sparsification, often fall short due to limited flexibility, and sensitivity to outlier weights. We explore 8:16 semi-structured sparsity, demonstrating its ability to surpass the Performance Threshold-where a compressed model matches the accuracy of its uncompressed or smaller counterpart under equivalent memory constraints. Compared to 2:4 sparsity, 8:16 offers greater flexibility with minimal storage overhead (0.875 vs. 0.75 bits/element). We also apply sparse structured patterns for salient weights, showing that structured sparsity for outliers is competitive with unstructured approaches leading to equivalent or better results. Finally, we demonstrate that simple techniques such as variance correction and SmoothQuant like weight equalization improve sparse models performance.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion-based image generators has made it increasingly difficult to distinguish generated from real images. This can erode trust in digital media, making it critical to develop generalizable detectors for generated images. Recent methods leverage diffusion denoising cues, but mainly focus on single-step reconstruction errors, ignoring the inherent sequential nature of the denoising process. In this work, we propose LATTE - Latent Trajectory Embedding - a novel approach that models the evolution of latent embeddings across several denoising timesteps. By modeling the trajectory of such embeddings rather than single-step errors, LATTE captures subtle, discriminative patterns that distinguish real from generated images. Each latent is refined by employing our latent-visual feature refinement module and aggregated into a unified representation. Afterwards, it is fused with the visual features and finally passed into a lightweight classifier. Our experiments demonstrate that LATTE surpasses the baselines on several established benchmarks, such as GenImage and DiffusionFake. Moreover, it demonstrates strong performance in cross-generator and cross-datasets settings, highlighting the potential of using the trajectory of latent embeddings for generated image detection. The code is available on the following link: https://github.com/AnaMVasilcoiu/LATTE-Diffusion-Detector.

Abstract: With the rise of online learning, the demand for efficient and consistent assessment in mathematics has significantly increased over the past decade. Machine Learning (ML), particularly Natural Language Processing (NLP), has been widely used for autograding student responses, particularly those involving text and/or mathematical expressions. However, there has been limited research on autograding responses involving students' handwritten graphs, despite their prevalence in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) curricula. In this study, we implement multimodal meta-learning models for autograding images containing students' handwritten graphs and text. We further compare the performance of Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) with these specially trained metalearning models. Our results, evaluated on a real-world dataset collected from our institution, show that the best-performing meta-learning models outperform VLLMs in 2-way classification tasks. In contrast, in more complex 3-way classification tasks, the best-performing VLLMs slightly outperform the meta-learning models. While VLLMs show promising results, their reliability and practical applicability remain uncertain and require further investigation.

Abstract: This article explores the feasibility of creating an "electronic copy" of a deceased researcher by training artificial intelligence (AI) on the data stored in their personal computers. By analyzing typical data volumes on inherited researcher computers, including textual files such as articles, emails, and drafts, it is estimated that approximately one million words are available for AI training. This volume is sufficient for fine-tuning advanced pre-trained models like GPT-4 to replicate a researcher's writing style, domain expertise, and rhetorical voice with high fidelity. The study also discusses the potential enhancements from including non-textual data and file metadata to enrich the AI's representation of the researcher. Extensions of the concept include communication between living researchers and their electronic copies, collaboration among individual electronic copies, as well as the creation and interconnection of organizational electronic copies to optimize information access and strategic decision-making. Ethical considerations such as ownership and security of these electronic copies are highlighted as critical for responsible implementation. The findings suggest promising opportunities for AI-driven preservation and augmentation of intellectual legacy.

Abstract: Understanding human mobility is essential for applications in public health, transportation, and urban planning. However, mobility data often suffers from sparsity due to limitations in data collection methods, such as infrequent GPS sampling or call detail record (CDR) data that only capture locations during communication events. To address this challenge, we propose BERT4Traj, a transformer based model that reconstructs complete mobility trajectories by predicting hidden visits in sparse movement sequences. Inspired by BERT's masked language modeling objective and self_attention mechanisms, BERT4Traj leverages spatial embeddings, temporal embeddings, and contextual background features such as demographics and anchor points. We evaluate BERT4Traj on real world CDR and GPS datasets collected in Kampala, Uganda, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms traditional models such as Markov Chains, KNN, RNNs, and LSTMs. Our results show that BERT4Traj effectively reconstructs detailed and continuous mobility trajectories, enhancing insights into human movement patterns.

<title>LLM-Driven Auto Configuration for Transient IoT Device Collaboration</title>

Abstract: Today's Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved from simple sensing and actuation devices to those with embedded processing and intelligent services, enabling rich collaborations between users and their devices. However, enabling such collaboration becomes challenging when transient devices need to interact with host devices in temporarily visited environments. In such cases, fine-grained access control policies are necessary to ensure secure interactions; however, manually implementing them is often impractical for non-expert users. Moreover, at run-time, the system must automatically configure the devices and enforce such fine-grained access control rules. Additionally, the system must address the heterogeneity of devices.
  In this paper, we present CollabIoT, a system that enables secure and seamless device collaboration in transient IoT environments. CollabIoT employs a Large language Model (LLM)-driven approach to convert users' high-level intents to fine-grained access control policies. To support secure and seamless device collaboration, CollabIoT adopts capability-based access control for authorization and uses lightweight proxies for policy enforcement, providing hardware-independent abstractions.
  We implement a prototype of CollabIoT's policy generation and auto configuration pipelines and evaluate its efficacy on an IoT testbed and in large-scale emulated environments. We show that our LLM-based policy generation pipeline is able to generate functional and correct policies with 100% accuracy. At runtime, our evaluation shows that our system configures new devices in ~150 ms, and our proxy-based data plane incurs network overheads of up to 2 ms and access control overheads up to 0.3 ms.

Abstract: This research investigates the efficacy of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods in detecting misclassified intersection-related crashes in police-reported narratives. Using 2019 crash data from the Iowa Department of Transportation, we implemented and compared a comprehensive set of models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, BERT Sentence Embeddings, BERT Word Embeddings, and Albert Model. Model performance was systematically validated against expert reviews of potentially misclassified narratives, providing a rigorous assessment of classification accuracy. Results demonstrated that while traditional ML methods exhibited superior overall performance compared to some DL approaches, the Albert Model achieved the highest agreement with expert classifications (73% with Expert 1) and original tabular data (58%). Statistical analysis revealed that the Albert Model maintained performance levels similar to inter-expert consistency rates, significantly outperforming other approaches, particularly on ambiguous narratives. This work addresses a critical gap in transportation safety research through multi-modal integration analysis, which achieved a 54.2% reduction in error rates by combining narrative text with structured crash data. We conclude that hybrid approaches combining automated classification with targeted expert review offer a practical methodology for improving crash data quality, with substantial implications for transportation safety management and policy development.

Abstract: For years, semantic interoperability standards have sought to streamline the exchange of clinical data, yet their deployment remains time-consuming, resource-intensive, and technically challenging. To address this, we introduce a semi-automated approach that leverages large language models specifically GPT-4o and Llama 3.2 405b to convert structured clinical datasets into HL7 FHIR format while assessing accuracy, reliability, and security. Applying our method to the MIMIC-IV database, we combined embedding techniques, clustering algorithms, and semantic retrieval to craft prompts that guide the models in mapping each tabular field to its corresponding FHIR resource. In an initial benchmark, resource identification achieved a perfect F1-score, with GPT-4o outperforming Llama 3.2 thanks to the inclusion of FHIR resource schemas within the prompt. Under real-world conditions, accuracy dipped slightly to 94 %, but refinements to the prompting strategy restored robust mappings. Error analysis revealed occasional hallucinations of non-existent attributes and mismatches in granularity, which more detailed prompts can mitigate. Overall, our study demonstrates the feasibility of context-aware, LLM-driven transformation of clinical data into HL7 FHIR, laying the groundwork for semi-automated interoperability workflows. Future work will focus on fine-tuning models with specialized medical corpora, extending support to additional standards such as HL7 CDA and OMOP, and developing an interactive interface to enable expert validation and iterative refinement.

<title>ARF-RLHF: Adaptive Reward-Following for RLHF through Emotion-Driven Self-Supervision and Trace-Biased Dynamic Optimization</title>

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and autoregressive transformers, state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4.0, DeepSeek R1, and Llama 3.3 increasingly emphasize answer depth and personalization. However, most existing RLHF approaches (e.g., PPO, DPO) still rely on a binary-preference (BT) paradigm, which, while reducing annotation costs, still requires substantial human effort and captures only group-level tendencies rather than individual preferences. To overcome these limitations, we propose Adaptive Reward-Following (ARF), a self-assessment framework that leverages a high-precision emotion analyzer achieving over 70% accuracy on GoEmotions, Sentiment140, and DailyDialog to convert free-form user feedback into continuous preference scores. We further enrich and debias these signals through lightweight data augmentations, including synonym replacement, random trace truncation, and score bias annotation algorithm. A Dynamic Adapter Preference Tracker continuously models evolving user tastes in real time, enabling our novel Trace Bias (TB) fine-tuning algorithm to optimize directly on these tracked rewards instead of coarse binary labels. Experiments on Qwen-2/2.5, Gemma-2, and Llama-3.2 across four preference domains demonstrate that ARF achieves an improvement of 3.3% over PPO and 7.6% over DPO. Moreover, TB preserves theoretical alignment with PPO and DPO objectives. Overall, ARF presents a scalable, personalized, and cost-effective approach to RLHF LLMs through autonomous reward modeling.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at logical and algorithmic reasoning, yet their emotional intelligence (EQ) still lags far behind their cognitive prowess. While reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced in other domains, its application to dialogue-especially for emotional intelligence-remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce RLVER, the first end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that leverages verifiable emotion rewards from simulated users to cultivate higher-order empathetic abilities in LLMs. Within this framework, self-consistent affective simulated users engage in dialogue rollouts and produce deterministic emotion scores during conversations, serving as reward signals to guide the LLM's learning. Fine-tuning publicly available Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model with PPO boosts its Sentient-Benchmark score from 13.3 to 79.2 while largely preserving mathematical and coding competence. Extensive experiments reveal that: (i) RLVER consistently improves multiple dialogue capabilities; (ii) Thinking and non-thinking models show distinct trends--thinking models excel in empathy and insight, while non-thinking models favor action; (iii) GRPO often yields stable gains, while PPO can push certain capabilities to a higher ceiling; (iv) More challenging environments are not always better-moderate ones can yield stronger outcomes. Our results show that RLVER is a practical route toward emotionally intelligent and broadly capable language agents.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to compute three-dimensional Magnetohydrodynamic equilibria by parametrizing Fourier modes with artificial neural networks and compare it to equilibria computed by conventional solvers. The full nonlinear global force residual across the volume in real space is then minimized with first order optimizers. Already,we observe competitive computational cost to arrive at the same minimum residuals computed by existing codes. With increased computational cost,lower minima of the residual are achieved by the neural networks,establishing a new lower bound for the force residual. We use minimally complex neural networks,and we expect significant improvements for solving not only single equilibria with neural networks,but also for computing neural network models valid over continuous distributions of equilibria.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strikingly conflicting behaviors: they can appear steadfastly overconfident in their initial answers whilst at the same time being prone to excessive doubt when challenged. To investigate this apparent paradox, we developed a novel experimental paradigm, exploiting the unique ability to obtain confidence estimates from LLMs without creating memory of their initial judgments -- something impossible in human participants. We show that LLMs -- Gemma 3, GPT4o and o1-preview -- exhibit a pronounced choice-supportive bias that reinforces and boosts their estimate of confidence in their answer, resulting in a marked resistance to change their mind. We further demonstrate that LLMs markedly overweight inconsistent compared to consistent advice, in a fashion that deviates qualitatively from normative Bayesian updating. Finally, we demonstrate that these two mechanisms -- a drive to maintain consistency with prior commitments and hypersensitivity to contradictory feedback -- parsimoniously capture LLM behavior in a different domain. Together, these findings furnish a mechanistic account of LLM confidence that explains both their stubbornness and excessive sensitivity to criticism.

Abstract: This paper explores the relationship between accent strength and articulatory features inferred from acoustic speech. To quantify accent strength, we compare phonetic transcriptions with transcriptions based on dictionary-based references, computing phoneme-level difference as a measure of accent strength. The proposed framework leverages recent self-supervised learning articulatory inversion techniques to estimate articulatory features. Analyzing a corpus of read speech from American and British English speakers, this study examines correlations between derived articulatory parameters and accent strength proxies, associating systematic articulatory differences with indexed accent strength. Results indicate that tongue positioning patterns distinguish the two dialects, with notable differences inter-dialects in rhotic and low back vowels. These findings contribute to automated accent analysis and articulatory modeling for speech processing applications.

Abstract: With the growing use of language models (LMs) in clinical environments, there is an immediate need to evaluate the accuracy and safety of LM-generated medical text. Currently, such evaluation relies solely on manual physician review. However, detecting errors in LM-generated text is challenging because 1) manual review is costly and 2) expert-composed reference outputs are often unavailable in real-world settings. While the "LM-as-judge" paradigm (a LM evaluating another LM) offers scalable evaluation, even frontier LMs can miss subtle but clinically significant errors. To address these challenges, we propose MedVAL, a self-supervised framework that leverages synthetic data to train evaluator LMs to assess whether LM-generated medical outputs are factually consistent with inputs, without requiring physician labels or reference outputs. To evaluate LM performance, we introduce MedVAL-Bench, a dataset containing 840 outputs annotated by physicians, following a physician-defined taxonomy of risk levels and error categories. Across 6 diverse medical tasks and 10 state-of-the-art LMs spanning open-source, proprietary, and medically adapted models, MedVAL fine-tuning significantly improves (p < 0.001) alignment with physicians on both seen and unseen tasks, increasing average F1 scores from 66% to 83%, with per-sample safety classification scores up to 86%. MedVAL improves the performance of even the best-performing proprietary LM (GPT-4o) by 8%. To support a scalable, risk-aware pathway towards clinical integration, we open-source the 1) codebase ( https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/MedVAL ), 2) MedVAL-Bench ( https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanfordmimi/MedVAL-Bench ), and 3) MedVAL-4B ( https://huggingface.co/stanfordmimi/MedVAL-4B ), the best-performing open-source LM. Our research provides the first evidence of LMs approaching expert-level validation ability for medical text.

Abstract: Large language model assistants (LLM-assistants) present new opportunities to transform software development. Developers are increasingly adopting these tools across tasks, including coding, testing, debugging, documentation, and design. Yet, despite growing interest, there is no synthesis of how LLM-assistants affect software developer productivity. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review of 37 peer-reviewed studies published between January 2014 and December 2024 that examine this impact. Our analysis reveals that LLM-assistants offer both considerable benefits and critical risks. Commonly reported gains include minimized code search, accelerated development, and the automation of trivial and repetitive tasks. However, studies also highlight concerns around cognitive offloading, reduced team collaboration, and inconsistent effects on code quality. While the majority of studies (92%) adopt a multi-dimensional perspective by examining at least two SPACE dimensions, reflecting increased awareness of the complexity of developer productivity, only 14% extend beyond three dimensions, indicating substantial room for more integrated evaluations. Satisfaction, Performance, and Efficiency are the most frequently investigated dimensions, whereas Communication and Activity remain underexplored. Most studies are exploratory (64%) and methodologically diverse, but lack longitudinal and team-based evaluations. This review surfaces key research gaps and provides recommendations for future research and practice. All artifacts associated with this study are publicly available at https://zenodo.org/records/15788502.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed various domains, particularly computer science (CS) education. These models exhibit remarkable capabilities in code-related tasks and problem-solving, raising questions about their potential and limitations in advanced CS contexts. This study presents a novel bilingual (English-Romanian) multimodal (text and image) dataset of multiple-choice questions derived from a high-level computer science competition. A particularity of our dataset is that the problems are conceived such that some of them are easier solved using reasoning on paper, while for others writing code is more efficient. We systematically evaluate State of The Art LLMs on this dataset, analyzing their performance on theoretical programming tasks. Our findings reveal the strengths and limitations of current LLMs, including the influence of language choice (English vs. Romanian), providing insights into their applicability in CS education and competition settings. We also address critical ethical considerations surrounding educational integrity and the fairness of assessments in the context of LLM usage. These discussions aim to inform future educational practices and policies. To support further research, our dataset will be made publicly available in both English and Romanian. Additionally, we release an educational application tailored for Romanian students, enabling them to self-assess using the dataset in an interactive and practice-oriented environment.

Abstract: Reasoning models generate chain-of-thought (CoT) tokens before their final output, but how this affects their vulnerability to jailbreak attacks remains unclear. While traditional language models make refusal decisions at the prompt-response boundary, we find evidence that DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B makes these decisions within its CoT generation. We identify a linear direction in activation space during CoT token generation that predicts whether the model will refuse or comply -- termed the "caution" direction because it corresponds to cautious reasoning patterns in the generated text. Ablating this direction from model activations increases harmful compliance, effectively jailbreaking the model. We additionally show that intervening only on CoT token activations suffices to control final outputs, and that incorporating this direction into prompt-based attacks improves success rates. Our findings suggest that the chain-of-thought itself is a promising new target for adversarial manipulation in reasoning models.

Abstract: Transfer learning has become an essential paradigm in artificial intelligence, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a source task to improve performance on a target task. This approach, particularly through techniques such as pretraining and fine-tuning, has seen significant success in fields like computer vision and natural language processing. However, despite its widespread use, how to reliably assess the transferability of knowledge remains a challenge. Understanding the theoretical underpinnings of each transferability metric is critical for ensuring the success of transfer learning. In this survey, we provide a unified taxonomy of transferability metrics, categorizing them based on transferable knowledge types and measurement granularity. This work examines the various metrics developed to evaluate the potential of source knowledge for transfer learning and their applicability across different learning paradigms emphasizing the need for careful selection of these metrics. By offering insights into how different metrics work under varying conditions, this survey aims to guide researchers and practitioners in selecting the most appropriate metric for specific applications, contributing to more efficient, reliable, and trustworthy AI systems. Finally, we discuss some open challenges in this field and propose future research directions to further advance the application of transferability metrics in trustworthy transfer learning.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL)-based general circulation models (GCMs) are emerging as fast simulators, yet their ability to replicate extreme events outside their training range remains unknown. Here, we evaluate two such models -- the hybrid Neural General Circulation Model (NGCM) and purely data-driven Deep Learning Earth System Model (DL\textit{ESy}M) -- against a conventional high-resolution land-atmosphere model (HiRAM) in simulating land heatwaves and coldwaves. All models are forced with observed sea surface temperatures and sea ice over 1900-2020, focusing on the out-of-sample early-20th-century period (1900-1960). Both DL models generalize successfully to unseen climate conditions, broadly reproducing the frequency and spatial patterns of heatwave and cold wave events during 1900-1960 with skill comparable to HiRAM. An exception is over portions of North Asia and North America, where all models perform poorly during 1940-1960. Due to excessive temperature autocorrelation, DL\textit{ESy}M tends to overestimate heatwave and cold wave frequencies, whereas the physics-DL hybrid NGCM exhibits persistence more similar to HiRAM.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into applications ranging from review summarization to medical diagnosis support, where they affect human decisions. Even though LLMs perform well in many tasks, they may also inherit societal or cognitive biases, which can inadvertently transfer to humans. We investigate when and how LLMs expose users to biased content and quantify its severity. Specifically, we assess three LLM families in summarization and news fact-checking tasks, evaluating how much LLMs stay consistent with their context and/or hallucinate. Our findings show that LLMs expose users to content that changes the sentiment of the context in 21.86% of the cases, hallucinates on post-knowledge-cutoff data questions in 57.33% of the cases, and primacy bias in 5.94% of the cases. We evaluate 18 distinct mitigation methods across three LLM families and find that targeted interventions can be effective. Given the prevalent use of LLMs in high-stakes domains, such as healthcare or legal analysis, our results highlight the need for robust technical safeguards and for developing user-centered interventions that address LLM limitations.

Abstract: Sudden Death Syndrome (SDS), caused by Fusarium virguliforme, poses a significant threat to soybean production. This study presents an AI-driven web application for early detection of SDS on soybean leaves using hyperspectral imaging, enabling diagnosis prior to visible symptom onset. Leaf samples from healthy and inoculated plants were scanned using a portable hyperspectral imaging system (398-1011 nm), and a Genetic Algorithm was employed to select five informative wavelengths (505.4, 563.7, 712.2, 812.9, and 908.4 nm) critical for discriminating infection status. These selected bands were fed into a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract spatial-spectral features, which were subsequently classified using ten classical machine learning models. Ensemble classifiers (Random Forest, AdaBoost), Linear SVM, and Neural Net achieved the highest accuracy (>98%) and minimal error across all folds, as confirmed by confusion matrices and cross-validation metrics. Poor performance by Gaussian Process and QDA highlighted their unsuitability for this dataset. The trained models were deployed within a web application that enables users to upload hyperspectral leaf images, visualize spectral profiles, and receive real-time classification results. This system supports rapid and accessible plant disease diagnostics, contributing to precision agriculture practices. Future work will expand the training dataset to encompass diverse genotypes, field conditions, and disease stages, and will extend the system for multiclass disease classification and broader crop applicability.

Abstract: This survey study investigates how digital humanists perceive and approach generative AI disclosure in research. The results indicate that while digital humanities scholars acknowledge the importance of disclosing GenAI use, the actual rate of disclosure in research practice remains low. Respondents differ in their views on which activities most require disclosure and on the most appropriate methods for doing so. Most also believe that safeguards for AI disclosure should be established through institutional policies rather than left to individual decisions. The study's findings will offer empirical guidance to scholars, institutional leaders, funders, and other stakeholders responsible for shaping effective disclosure policies.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) allows model builders to capture the task specific parameters into adapters, which are a fraction of the size of the original base model. Popularity of PEFT technique for fine-tuning has led to creation of a large number of adapters for popular Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing frameworks fall short in supporting inference or fine-tuning with multiple adapters in the following ways. 1) For fine-tuning, each job needs to deploy its dedicated base model instance, which results in excessive GPU memory consumption and poor GPU utilization. 2) While popular inference platforms can serve multiple PEFT adapters, they do not allow independent resource management or mixing of different PEFT methods. 3) They cannot share resources (such as base model instance) between inference and fine-tuning jobs. 4) They do not provide privacy to users who may not wish to expose their fine-tuned parameters to service providers. In Symbiosis, we address the above problems by enabling as-a-service deployment of base model. The base model layers can be shared across multiple inference or fine-tuning processes. Our split-execution technique decouples the execution of client-specific adapters and layers from the frozen base model layers offering them flexibility to manage their resources, to select their fine-tuning method, to achieve their performance goals. Our approach is transparent to models and works out-of-the-box for most models in the transformers library. Our evaluation on Llama2-13B shows the compared to baseline, Symbiosis can fine-tune 4X more adapters on the same set of GPUs in the same amount of time.

Abstract: To be effective, efficient, and diverse, deep learning models need to dynamically choose its architecture based on signals from a population of neurons. We hypothesize dynamic routing models can be improved with neural inhibition in those neural populations. This means signals commonly shared among the various modes of data statistics can be inhibited so that the routing model can choose a specialized expert path for each data sample. Only through inhibition is the routing mechanism able to effectively select neural pathways. We believe this is an under-studied and under-verified implementation methodology for Mixture-of-Experts, dynamic routing, and transformer language models. We provide experimental evidence that the neural inhibition algorithm significantly boosts the performance of general tasks and motivates more effort to be invested in this research direction.

<title>The role of gain neuromodulation in layer-5 pyramidal neurons</title>

Abstract: Biological and artificial learning systems alike confront the plasticity-stability dilemma. In the brain, neuromodulators such as acetylcholine and noradrenaline relieve this tension by tuning neuronal gain and inhibitory gating, balancing segregation and integration of circuits. Fed by dense cholinergic and noradrenergic projections from the ascending arousal system, layer-5 pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex offer a relevant substrate for understanding these dynamics. When distal dendritic signals coincide with back-propagating action potentials, calcium plateaus turn a single somatic spike into a high-gain burst, and interneuron inhibition sculpts the output. These properties make layer-5 cells gain-tunable amplifiers that translate neuromodulatory cues into flexible cortical activity. To capture this mechanism we developed a two-compartment Izhikevich model for pyramidal neurons and single-compartment somatostatin (SOM) and parvalbumin (PV) interneurons, linked by Gaussian connectivity and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). The soma and apical dendrite are so coupled that somatic spikes back-propagate, while dendritic plateaus can switch the soma from regular firing to bursting by shifting reset and adaptation variables. We show that stronger dendritic drive or tighter coupling raise gain by increasing the likelihood of calcium-triggered somatic bursts. In contrast, dendritic-targeted inhibition suppresses gain, while somatic-targeted inhibition raises the firing threshold of neighboring neurons, thus gating neurons output. Notably, bursting accelerates STDP, supporting rapid synaptic reconfiguration and flexibility.This suggests that brief gain pulses driven by neuromodulators could serve as an adaptive two-timescale optimization mechanism, effectively modulating the synaptic weight updates.

<title>On Jailbreaking Quantized Language Models Through Fault Injection Attacks</title>

Abstract: The safety alignment of Language Models (LMs) is a critical concern, yet their integrity can be challenged by direct parameter manipulation attacks, such as those potentially induced by fault injection. As LMs are increasingly deployed using low-precision quantization for efficiency, this paper investigates the efficacy of such attacks for jailbreaking aligned LMs across different quantization schemes. We propose gradient-guided attacks, including a tailored progressive bit-level search algorithm introduced herein and a comparative word-level (single weight update) attack. Our evaluation on Llama-3.2-3B, Phi-4-mini, and Llama-3-8B across FP16 (baseline), and weight-only quantization (FP8, INT8, INT4) reveals that quantization significantly influences attack success. While attacks readily achieve high success (>80\% Attack Success Rate, ASR) on FP16 models, within an attack budget of 25 perturbations, FP8 and INT8 models exhibit ASRs below 20\% and 50\%, respectively. Increasing the perturbation budget up to 150 bit-flips, FP8 models maintained ASR below 65\%, demonstrating some resilience compared to INT8 and INT4 models that have high ASR. In addition, analysis of perturbation locations revealed differing architectural targets across quantization schemes, with (FP16, INT4) and (INT8, FP8) showing similar characteristics. Besides, jailbreaks induced in FP16 models were highly transferable to subsequent FP8/INT8 quantization (<5\% ASR difference), though INT4 significantly reduced transferred ASR (avg. 35\% drop). These findings highlight that while common quantization schemes, particularly FP8, increase the difficulty of direct parameter manipulation jailbreaks, vulnerabilities can still persist, especially through post-attack quantization.

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) traditionally relies on auditory data analysis for emotion classification. Several studies have adopted different methods for SER. However, existing SER methods often struggle to capture subtle emotional variations and generalize across diverse datasets. In this article, we use Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) as spectral features to bridge the gap between computational emotion processing and human auditory perception. To further improve robustness and feature diversity, we propose a novel 1D-CNN-based SER framework that integrates data augmentation techniques. MFCC features extracted from the augmented data are processed using a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture enhanced with channel and spatial attention mechanisms. These attention modules allow the model to highlight key emotional patterns, enhancing its ability to capture subtle variations in speech signals. The proposed method delivers cutting-edge performance, achieving the accuracy of 97.49% for SAVEE, 99.23% for RAVDESS, 89.31% for CREMA-D, 99.82% for TESS, 99.53% for EMO-DB, and 96.39% for EMOVO. Experimental results show new benchmarks in SER, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in recognizing emotional expressions with high precision. Our evaluation demonstrates that the integration of advanced Deep Learning (DL) methods substantially enhances generalization across diverse datasets, underscoring their potential to advance SER for real-world deployment in assistive technologies and human-computer interaction.

<title>RefineX: Learning to Refine Pre-training Data at Scale from Expert-Guided Programs</title>

Abstract: The foundational capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are deeply influenced by the quality of their pre-training corpora. However, enhancing data quality at scale remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the trade-off between refinement effectiveness and processing efficiency. While rule-based filtering remains the dominant paradigm, it typically operates at the document level and lacks the granularity needed to refine specific content within documents. Inspired by emerging work such as ProX, we propose $\textbf{RefineX}$, a novel framework for large-scale, surgical refinement of pre-training data through programmatic editing tasks. RefineX enables efficient and fine-grained data refinement while reliably preserving the diversity and naturalness of raw text. The core strength of RefineX lies in distilling high-quality, expert-guided end-to-end refinement results into minimal edit-based deletion programs. This high-precision distillation pipeline is used to train an efficient and reliable refine model that can systematically improve every instance in the corpus at scale. We evaluate RefineX across from-scratch pre-training at multiple model scales and find that it consistently outperforms models trained on raw, filtered, or alternatively refined data across diverse downstream tasks. On the 750M model, RefineX yields 2.6%-7.2% average gains on lighteval tasks, and achieves comparable performance using significantly fewer training tokens. Further analysis shows that RefineX reliably enhances text quality with both high efficiency and precision, outperforming prior approaches such as end-to-end generation and Prox-C. These results position RefineX as a scalable, effective, and reliable solution for optimizing pre-training data in modern LLM pipelines.

<title>Investigating Redundancy in Multimodal Large Language Models with Multiple Vision Encoders</title>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly adopt multiple vision encoders to capture diverse visual information, ranging from coarse semantics to fine grained details. While this approach is intended to enhance visual understanding capability, we observe that the performance gains from adding encoders often diminish and can even lead to performance degradation, a phenomenon we term encoder redundancy. This paper presents a systematic investigation into this issue. Through comprehensive ablation studies on state of the art multi encoder MLLMs, we empirically demonstrate that significant redundancy exists. To quantify each encoder's unique contribution, we propose a principled metric: the Conditional Utilization Rate (CUR). Building on CUR, we introduce the Information Gap (IG) to capture the overall disparity in encoder utility within a model.Our experiments reveal that certain vision encoders contribute little, or even negatively, to overall performance, confirming substantial redundancy. Our experiments reveal that certain vision encoders contribute minimally, or even negatively, to the model's performance, confirming the prevalence of redundancy. These findings highlight critical inefficiencies in current multi encoder designs and establish that our proposed metrics can serve as valuable diagnostic tools for developing more efficient and effective multimodal architectures.

Abstract: A significant use case of instruction-finetuned Large Language Models (LLMs) is to solve question-answering tasks interactively. In this setting, an LLM agent is tasked with making a prediction by sequentially querying relevant information from the user, as opposed to a single-turn conversation. This paper explores sequential querying strategies that aim to minimize the expected number of queries. One such strategy is Information Pursuit (IP), a greedy algorithm that at each iteration selects the query that maximizes information gain or equivalently minimizes uncertainty. However, obtaining accurate estimates of mutual information or conditional entropy for LLMs is very difficult in practice due to over- or under-confident LLM probabilities, which leads to suboptimal query selection and predictive performance. To better estimate the uncertainty at each iteration, we propose Conformal Information Pursuit (C-IP), an alternative approach to sequential information gain based on conformal prediction sets. More specifically, C-IP leverages a relationship between prediction sets and conditional entropy at each iteration to estimate uncertainty based on the average size of conformal prediction sets. In contrast to conditional entropy, we find that conformal prediction sets are a distribution-free and robust method of measuring uncertainty. Experiments with 20 Questions show that C-IP obtains better predictive performance and shorter query-answer chains compared to previous approaches to IP and uncertainty-based chain-of-thought methods. Furthermore, extending to an interactive medical setting between a doctor and a patient on the MediQ dataset, C-IP achieves competitive performance with direct single-turn prediction while offering greater interpretability.

<title>MGAA: Multi-Granular Adaptive Allocation fof Low-Rank Compression of LLMs</title>

Abstract: The enormous parameter scale of large language models (LLMs) has made model compression a research hotspot, which aims to alleviate computational resource demands during deployment and inference. As a promising direction, low-rank approximation technique has made remarkable achievements. Nevertheless, unfortunately, the vast majority of studies to low-rank approximation compression generally apply uniform compression ratios across all weight matrices, while disregarding their inherently differentiated impacts on the model's performance. Although a few recent work attempts to employ heuristic search strategies to achieve the optimal parameter allocation, such strategies are computationally inefficient and lose the generalization ability in the era of LLMs. In this study, we propose a novel parameter Multi-Granular Adaptive Allocation (MGAA) method, which can adaptively allocate parameters between and within sublayers without task-specific evaluations in the compression process. MGAA consists of two components: 1) Among different sublayers, it assigns compression ratios based on their cosine similarity between inputs and outputs, allowing for a more tailored compression in sublayers with varying degrees of importance, and 2) Within each sublayer, it allocates different compression ratios to weight matrices based on their energy distribution characteristics, ensuring a consistent energy retention ratio while optimizing compression efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations of MGAA across multiple LLMs backbone models and benchmark datasets demonstrate its superior performance. Additionally, we apply our MGAA to multimodal model LLaVA, exhibiting remarkable performance improvements.

Abstract: In semi-supervised semantic segmentation, existing studies have shown promising results in academic settings with controlled splits of benchmark datasets. However, the potential benefits of leveraging significantly larger sets of unlabeled images remain unexplored. In real-world scenarios, abundant unlabeled images are often available from online sources (web-scraped images) or large-scale datasets. However, these images may have different distributions from those of the target dataset, a situation known as out-of-distribution (OOD). Using these images as unlabeled data in semi-supervised learning can lead to inaccurate pseudo-labels, potentially misguiding network training. In this paper, we propose a new semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework with an open-vocabulary segmentation model (SemiOVS) to effectively utilize unlabeled OOD images. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC and Context datasets demonstrate two key findings: (1) using additional unlabeled images improves the performance of semi-supervised learners in scenarios with few labels, and (2) using the open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) model to pseudo-label OOD images leads to substantial performance gains. In particular, SemiOVS outperforms existing PrevMatch and SemiVL methods by +3.5 and +3.0 mIoU, respectively, on Pascal VOC with a 92-label setting, achieving state-of-the-art performance. These findings demonstrate that our approach effectively utilizes abundant unlabeled OOD images for semantic segmentation tasks. We hope this work can inspire future research and real-world applications. The code is available at https://github.com/wooseok-shin/SemiOVS

Abstract: Human creative ideation involves both exploration of diverse ideas (divergence) and selective synthesis of explored ideas into coherent combinations (convergence). While processes of divergence and convergence are often interleaved and nested, existing AI-powered creativity support tools (CSTs) lack support for sophisticated orchestration of divergence and convergence. We present Reverger, an AI-powered CST that helps users ideate variations of conceptual directions for modifying a story by scaffolding flexible iteration between divergence and convergence. For divergence, our tool enables recursive exploration of alternative high-level directions for modifying a specific part of the original story. For convergence, it allows users to collect explored high-level directions and synthesize them into concrete variations. Users can then iterate between divergence and convergence until they find a satisfactory outcome. A within-subject study revealed that Reverger permitted participants to explore more unexpected and diverse high-level directions than a comparable baseline. Reverger users also felt that they had more fine-grained control and discovered more effort-worthy outcomes.

Abstract: This paper studies causal discovery in irregularly sampled time series-a pivotal challenge in high-stakes domains like finance, healthcare, and climate science, where missing data and inconsistent sampling frequencies distort causal mechanisms. Traditional methods (e.g., Granger causality, PCMCI) fail to reconcile multi-scale interactions (e.g., hourly storms vs. decadal climate shifts), while neural approaches (e.g., CUTS+) lack interpretability, stemming from a critical gap: existing frameworks either rigidly assume temporal regularity or aggregate dynamics into opaque representations, neglecting real-world granularity and auditable logic. To bridge this gap, we propose ReTimeCausal, a novel integration of Additive Noise Models (ANM) and Expectation-Maximization (EM) that unifies physics-guided data imputation with sparse causal inference. Through kernelized sparse regression and structural constraints, ReTimeCausal iteratively refines missing values (E-step) and causal graphs (M-step), resolving cross-frequency dependencies and missing data issues. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that ReTimeCausal outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods under challenging irregular sampling and missing data conditions.

Abstract: Document level Machine Translation (DocMT) approaches often struggle with effectively capturing discourse level phenomena. Existing approaches rely on heuristic rules to segment documents into discourse units, which rarely align with the true discourse structure required for accurate translation. Otherwise, they fail to maintain consistency throughout the document during translation. To address these challenges, we propose Graph Augmented Agentic Framework for Document Level Translation (GRAFT), a novel graph based DocMT system that leverages Large Language Model (LLM) agents for document translation. Our approach integrates segmentation, directed acyclic graph (DAG) based dependency modelling, and discourse aware translation into a cohesive framework. Experiments conducted across eight translation directions and six diverse domains demonstrate that GRAFT achieves significant performance gains over state of the art DocMT systems. Specifically, GRAFT delivers an average improvement of 2.8 d BLEU on the TED test sets from IWSLT2017 over strong baselines and 2.3 d BLEU for domain specific translation from English to Chinese. Moreover, our analyses highlight the consistent ability of GRAFT to address discourse level phenomena, yielding coherent and contextually accurate translations.

Abstract: Translating nuanced, textually-defined authorial writing styles into compelling visual representations presents a novel challenge in generative AI. This paper introduces a pipeline that leverages Author Writing Sheets (AWS) - structured summaries of an author's literary characteristics - as input to a Large Language Model (LLM, Claude 3.7 Sonnet). The LLM interprets the AWS to generate three distinct, descriptive text-to-image prompts, which are then rendered by a diffusion model (Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium). We evaluated our approach using 49 author styles from Reddit data, with human evaluators assessing the stylistic match and visual distinctiveness of the generated images. Results indicate a good perceived alignment between the generated visuals and the textual authorial profiles (mean style match: $4.08/5$), with images rated as moderately distinctive. Qualitative analysis further highlighted the pipeline's ability to capture mood and atmosphere, while also identifying challenges in representing highly abstract narrative elements. This work contributes a novel end-to-end methodology for visual authorial style personalization and provides an initial empirical validation, opening avenues for applications in creative assistance and cross-modal understanding.

Abstract: We formulate learning guided Automated Theorem Proving as Partial Label Learning, building the first bridge across these fields of research and providing a theoretical framework for dealing with alternative proofs during learning. We use the plCoP theorem prover to demonstrate that methods from the Partial Label Learning literature tend to increase the performance of learning assisted theorem provers.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approaches have been increasingly applied in drug discovery to learn molecular representations and identify substructures driving property predictions. However, building end-to-end explainable machine learning models for structure-activity relationship (SAR) modeling for compound property prediction faces many challenges, such as limited activity data per target and the sensitivity of properties to subtle molecular changes. To address this, we leveraged activity-cliff molecule pairs, i.e., compounds sharing a common scaffold but differing sharply in potency, targeting three proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src proteins (i.e., PDB IDs 1O42, 2H8H, and 4MXO). We implemented graph neural network (GNN) methods to obtain atom-level feature information and predict compound-protein affinity (i.e., half maximal inhibitory concentration, IC50). In addition, we trained GNN models with different structure-aware loss functions to adequately leverage molecular property and structure information. We also utilized group lasso and sparse group lasso to prune and highlight molecular subgraphs and enhance the structure-specific model explainability for the predicted property difference in molecular activity-cliff pairs. We improved drug property prediction by integrating common and uncommon node information and using sparse group lasso, reducing the average root mean squared error (RMSE) by 12.70%, and achieving the lowest averaged RMSE=0.2551 and the highest PCC=0.9572. Furthermore, applying regularization enhances feature attribution methods that estimate the contribution of each atom in the molecular graphs by boosting global direction scores and atom-level accuracy in atom coloring accuracy, which improves model interpretability in drug discovery pipelines, particularly in investigating important molecular substructures in lead optimization.

<title>Source-Free Domain Adaptation via Multi-view Contrastive Learning</title>

Abstract: Domain adaptation has become a widely adopted approach in machine learning due to the high costs associated with labeling data. It is typically applied when access to a labeled source domain is available. However, in real-world scenarios, privacy concerns often restrict access to sensitive information, such as fingerprints, bank account details, and facial images. A promising solution to this issue is Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA), which enables domain adaptation without requiring access to labeled target domain data. Recent research demonstrates that SFUDA can effectively address domain discrepancies; however, two key challenges remain: (1) the low quality of prototype samples, and (2) the incorrect assignment of pseudo-labels. To tackle these challenges, we propose a method consisting of three main phases. In the first phase, we introduce a Reliable Sample Memory (RSM) module to improve the quality of prototypes by selecting more representative samples. In the second phase, we employ a Multi-View Contrastive Learning (MVCL) approach to enhance pseudo-label quality by leveraging multiple data augmentations. In the final phase, we apply a noisy label filtering technique to further refine the pseudo-labels. Our experiments on three benchmark datasets - VisDA 2017, Office-Home, and Office-31 - demonstrate that our method achieves approximately 2 percent and 6 percent improvements in classification accuracy over the second-best method and the average of 13 well-known state-of-the-art approaches, respectively.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in understanding text and generating high-quality responses. However, a critical distinction from human cognition is their typical lack of a distinct internal `reading' or deliberation phase before `speaking' (i.e., generating text). Humans often engage in silent reading to comprehend context and formulate thoughts prior to articulation. This paper investigates methods to imbue LLMs with a similar capacity for internal processing.
  We introduce and evaluate techniques that encourage LLMs to `read silently.' Our findings indicate that even a straightforward approach, such as providing the model with an initial contextual prompt or `reading space' before it begins predicting subsequent tokens for the final output, can yield significant performance improvements. We further enhance this concept by developing a `reading buddy' architecture, where an auxiliary component silently processes the input and provides refined contextual insights to the primary generation model. These approaches aim to foster deeper understanding from LLMs so that they can produce better reasoned responses, moving them one step closer to more human-like text processing. Our results indicate that these simple techniques can provide surprisingly strong impact on accuracy with multiple point accuracy boost.

Abstract: To alleviate the reliance of deep neural networks on large-scale datasets, dataset distillation aims to generate compact, high-quality synthetic datasets that can achieve comparable performance to the original dataset. The integration of generative models has significantly advanced this field. However, existing approaches primarily focus on aligning the distilled dataset with the original one, often overlooking task-specific information that can be critical for optimal downstream performance. In this paper, focusing on the downstream task of classification, we propose a task-specific sampling strategy for generative dataset distillation that incorporates the concept of difficulty to consider the requirements of the target task better. The final dataset is sampled from a larger image pool with a sampling distribution obtained by matching the difficulty distribution of the original dataset. A logarithmic transformation is applied as a pre-processing step to correct for distributional bias. The results of extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and suggest its potential for enhancing performance on other downstream tasks.

Abstract: Detecting deepfakes involving face-swaps presents a significant challenge, particularly in real-world scenarios where anyone can perform face-swapping with freely available tools and apps without any technical knowledge. Existing deepfake detection methods rely on facial landmarks or inconsistencies in pixel-level features and often struggle with face-swap deepfakes, where the source face is seamlessly blended into the target image or video. The prevalence of face-swap is evident in everyday life, where it is used to spread false information, damage reputations, manipulate political opinions, create non-consensual intimate deepfakes (NCID), and exploit children by enabling the creation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Even prominent public figures are not immune to its impact, with numerous deepfakes of them circulating widely across social media platforms. Another challenge faced by deepfake detection methods is the creation of datasets that encompass a wide range of variations, as training models require substantial amounts of data. This raises privacy concerns, particularly regarding the processing and storage of personal facial data, which could lead to unauthorized access or misuse. Our key idea is to identify these style discrepancies to detect face-swapped images effectively without accessing the real facial image. We perform comprehensive evaluations using multiple datasets and face-swapping methods, which showcases the effectiveness of SafeVision in detecting face-swap deepfakes across diverse scenarios. SafeVision offers a reliable and scalable solution for detecting face-swaps in a privacy preserving manner, making it particularly effective in challenging real-world applications. To the best of our knowledge, SafeVision is the first deepfake detection using style features while providing inherent privacy protection.

<title>DESign: Dynamic Context-Aware Convolution and Efficient Subnet Regularization for Continuous Sign Language Recognition</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03339</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Current continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) methods struggle with handling diverse samples. Although dynamic convolutions are ideal for this task, they mainly focus on spatial modeling and fail to capture the temporal dynamics and contextual dependencies. To address this, we propose DESign, a novel framework that incorporates Dynamic Context-Aware Convolution (DCAC) and Subnet Regularization Connectionist Temporal Classification (SR-CTC). DCAC dynamically captures the inter-frame motion cues that constitute signs and uniquely adapts convolutional weights in a fine-grained manner based on contextual information, enabling the model to better generalize across diverse signing behaviors and boost recognition accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that existing methods still rely on only a limited number of frames for parameter updates during training, indicating that CTC learning overfits to a dominant path. To address this, SR-CTC regularizes training by applying supervision to subnetworks, encouraging the model to explore diverse CTC alignment paths and effectively preventing overfitting. A classifier-sharing strategy in SR-CTC further strengthens multi-scale consistency. Notably, SR-CTC introduces no inference overhead and can be seamlessly integrated into existing CSLR models to boost performance. Extensive ablations and visualizations further validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Results on mainstream CSLR datasets (i.e., PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14-T, CSL-Daily) demonstrate that DESign achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis, widely used in product reviews, also impacts financial markets by influencing asset prices through microblogs and news articles. Despite research in sentiment-driven finance, many studies focus on sentence-level classification, overlooking its practical application in trading. This study bridges that gap by evaluating sentiment-based trading strategies for generating positive alpha. We conduct a backtesting analysis using sentiment predictions from three models (two classification and one regression) applied to news articles on Dow Jones 30 stocks, comparing them to the benchmark Buy&amp;Hold strategy. Results show all models produced positive returns, with the regression model achieving the highest return of 50.63% over 28 months, outperforming the benchmark Buy&amp;Hold strategy. This highlights the potential of sentiment in enhancing investment strategies and financial decision-making.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection aims to localize semantic changes between images of the same location captured at different times. In the past few years, newer methods have attributed enhanced performance to the additions of new and complex components to existing architectures. Most fail to measure the performance contribution of fundamental design choices such as backbone selection, pre-training strategies, and training configurations. We claim that such fundamental design choices often improve performance even more significantly than the addition of new architectural components. Due to that, we systematically revisit the design space of change detection models and analyse the full potential of a well-optimised baseline. We identify a set of fundamental design choices that benefit both new and existing architectures. Leveraging this insight, we demonstrate that when carefully designed, even an architecturally simple model can match or surpass state-of-the-art performance on six challenging change detection datasets. Our best practices generalise beyond our architecture and also offer performance improvements when applied to related methods, indicating that the space of fundamental design choices has been underexplored. Our guidelines and architecture provide a strong foundation for future methods, emphasizing that optimizing core components is just as important as architectural novelty in advancing change detection performance.

<title>LLM4Hint: Leveraging Large Language Models for Hint Recommendation in Offline Query Optimization</title>

Abstract: Query optimization is essential for efficient SQL query execution in DBMS, and remains attractive over time due to the growth of data volumes and advances in hardware. Existing traditional optimizers struggle with the cumbersome hand-tuning required for complex workloads, and the learning-based methods face limitations in ensuring generalization. With the great success of Large Language Model (LLM) across diverse downstream tasks, this paper explores how LLMs can be incorporated to enhance the generalization of learned optimizers. Though promising, such an incorporation still presents challenges, mainly including high model inference latency, and the substantial fine-tuning cost and suboptimal performance due to inherent discrepancy between the token sequences in LLM and structured SQL execution plans with rich numerical features.
  In this paper, we focus on recurring queries in offline optimization to alleviate the issue of high inference latency, and propose \textbf{LLM4Hint} that leverages moderate-sized backbone LLMs to recommend query optimization hints. LLM4Hint achieves the goals through: (i) integrating a lightweight model to produce a soft prompt, which captures the data distribution in DBMS and the SQL predicates to provide sufficient optimization features while simultaneously reducing the context length fed to the LLM, (ii) devising a query rewriting strategy using a larger commercial LLM, so as to simplify SQL semantics for the backbone LLM and reduce fine-tuning costs, and (iii) introducing an explicit matching prompt to facilitate alignment between the LLM and the lightweight model, which can accelerate convergence of the combined model. Experiments show that LLM4Hint, by leveraging the LLM's stronger capability to understand the query statement, can outperform the state-of-the-art learned optimizers in terms of both effectiveness and generalization.

<title>Pose-Star: Anatomy-Aware Editing for Open-World Fashion Images</title>

Abstract: To advance real-world fashion image editing, we analyze existing two-stage pipelines(mask generation followed by diffusion-based editing)which overly prioritize generator optimization while neglecting mask controllability. This results in two critical limitations: I) poor user-defined flexibility (coarse-grained human masks restrict edits to predefined regions like upper torso; fine-grained clothes masks preserve poses but forbid style/length customization). II) weak pose robustness (mask generators fail due to articulated poses and miss rare regions like waist, while human parsers remain limited by predefined categories). To address these gaps, we propose Pose-Star, a framework that dynamically recomposes body structures (e.g., neck, chest, etc.) into anatomy-aware masks (e.g., chest-length) for user-defined edits. In Pose-Star, we calibrate diffusion-derived attention (Star tokens) via skeletal keypoints to enhance rare structure localization in complex poses, suppress noise through phase-aware analysis of attention dynamics (Convergence,Stabilization,Divergence) with threshold masking and sliding-window fusion, and refine edges via cross-self attention merging and Canny alignment. This work bridges controlled benchmarks and open-world demands, pioneering anatomy-aware, pose-robust editing and laying the foundation for industrial fashion image editing.

Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction is essential in drug discovery and related fields. However, existing graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle to simultaneously capture both local and global molecular structures. In this work, we propose a Multi-Level Fusion Graph Neural Network (MLFGNN) that integrates Graph Attention Networks and a novel Graph Transformer to jointly model local and global dependencies. In addition, we incorporate molecular fingerprints as a complementary modality and introduce a mechanism of interaction between attention to adaptively fuse information across representations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that MLFGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both classification and regression tasks. Interpretability analysis further reveals that the model effectively captures task-relevant chemical patterns, supporting the usefulness of multi-level and multi-modal fusion in molecular representation learning.

Abstract: Social determinants of health (SDoH) significantly influence health outcomes, shaping disease progression, treatment adherence, and health disparities. However, their documentation in structured electronic health records (EHRs) is often incomplete or missing. This study presents an approach based on large language models (LLMs) for extracting 13 SDoH categories from French clinical notes. We trained Flan-T5-Large on annotated social history sections from clinical notes at Nantes University Hospital, France. We evaluated the model at two levels: (i) identification of SDoH categories and associated values, and (ii) extraction of detailed SDoH with associated temporal and quantitative information. The model performance was assessed across four datasets, including two that we publicly release as open resources. The model achieved strong performance for identifying well-documented categories such as living condition, marital status, descendants, job, tobacco, and alcohol use (F1 score > 0.80). Performance was lower for categories with limited training data or highly variable expressions, such as employment status, housing, physical activity, income, and education. Our model identified 95.8% of patients with at least one SDoH, compared to 2.8% for ICD-10 codes from structured EHR data. Our error analysis showed that performance limitations were linked to annotation inconsistencies, reliance on English-centric tokenizer, and reduced generalizability due to the model being trained on social history sections only. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of NLP in improving the completeness of real-world SDoH data in a non-English EHR system.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in designing powerful adversarial evasion attacks for robustness verification, the evaluation of these methods often remains inconsistent and unreliable. Many assessments rely on mismatched models, unverified implementations, and uneven computational budgets, which can lead to biased results and a false sense of security. Consequently, robustness claims built on such flawed testing protocols may be misleading and give a false sense of security. As a concrete step toward improving evaluation reliability, we present AttackBench, a benchmark framework developed to assess the effectiveness of gradient-based attacks under standardized and reproducible conditions. AttackBench serves as an evaluation tool that ranks existing attack implementations based on a novel optimality metric, which enables researchers and practitioners to identify the most reliable and effective attack for use in subsequent robustness evaluations. The framework enforces consistent testing conditions and enables continuous updates, making it a reliable foundation for robustness verification.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP achieve cross-modal semantic alignment through contrastive learning, exhibiting robust zero-shot generalization. Traditional prompt engineering, however, predominantly relies on coarse-grained category labels, neglecting fine-grained local semantics. Existing approaches assume that VLMs inherently recognize localized visual details and attempt to enhance classification by augmenting text prompts with attribute descriptors generated by large language models. However, our systematic experiments reveal critical limitations: CLIP's strong bias toward global image patterns hinders its ability to process localized visual descriptors. To address this fundamental constraint, we propose a simple, effective, and plug-and-play solution that enables CLIP to ``See Both the Forest and the Trees." Specifically, we employ stochastic multi-crop augmentation to activate CLIP's latent capacity for localized feature analysis. By cropping only partial regions, the approach effectively constrains the model's receptive field and recalibrates its attention mechanism, thereby mitigating its inherent bias. We evaluate the proposed method under zero-shot, few-shot, and test-time adaptation settings, and extensive experiments demonstrate that D&amp;D achieves promising performance.

Abstract: Despite mounting evidence that multilinguality can be easily weaponized against language models (LMs), works across NLP Security remain overwhelmingly English-centric. In terms of securing LMs, the NLP norm of "English first" collides with standard procedure in cybersecurity, whereby practitioners are expected to anticipate and prepare for worst-case outcomes. To mitigate worst-case outcomes in NLP Security, researchers must be willing to engage with the weakest links in LM security: lower-resourced languages. Accordingly, this work examines the security of LMs for lower- and medium-resourced languages. We extend existing adversarial attacks for up to 70 languages to evaluate the security of monolingual and multilingual LMs for these languages. Through our analysis, we find that monolingual models are often too small in total number of parameters to ensure sound security, and that while multilinguality is helpful, it does not always guarantee improved security either. Ultimately, these findings highlight important considerations for more secure deployment of LMs, for communities of lower-resourced languages.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce BMMR, a large-scale bilingual, multimodal, multi-disciplinary reasoning dataset for the community to develop and evaluate large multimodal models (LMMs). BMMR comprises 110k college-level questions spanning 300 UNESCO-defined subjects, spanning diverse formats-multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, and open-ended QA-and sourced from both print and digital media such as books, exams, and quizzes. All data are curated and filtered via a human-in-the-loop and scalable framework, and each instance is paired with a high-quality reasoning path. The dataset is organized into two parts: BMMR-Eval that comprises 20,458 high-quality instances to comprehensively assess LMMs' knowledge and reasoning across multiple disciplines in both Chinese and English; and BMMR-Train that contains 88,991 instances to support further research and development, extending the current focus on mathematical reasoning to diverse disciplines and domains. In addition, we propose the process-based multi-discipline verifier (i.e., BMMR-Verifier) for accurate and fine-grained evaluation of reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on 24 models reveal that (i) even SOTA models (e.g., o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro) leave substantial headroom on BMMR-Eval; (ii) reasoning models exhibit discipline bias and outperform LMMs only on specific subjects; (iii) open-source models still trail their proprietary counterparts; and (iv) fine-tuning on BMMR-Train narrows this gap. Additionally, we conduct reasoning-chain analyses using BMMR-Verifier and other in-depth studies, uncovering the challenges LMMs currently face in multidisciplinary reasoning. We will release the data, and we hope our work can offer insights and contributions to the community.

Abstract: Feature generation (FG) aims to enhance the prediction potential of original data by constructing high-order feature combinations and removing redundant features. It is a key preprocessing step for tabular scientific data to improve downstream machine-learning model performance. Traditional methods face the following two challenges when dealing with the feature generation of scientific data: First, the effective construction of high-order feature combinations in scientific data necessitates profound and extensive domain-specific expertise. Secondly, as the order of feature combinations increases, the search space expands exponentially, imposing prohibitive human labor consumption. Advancements in the Data-Centric Artificial Intelligence (DCAI) paradigm have opened novel avenues for automating feature generation processes. Inspired by that, this paper revisits the conventional feature generation workflow and proposes the Multi-agent Feature Generation (MAFG) framework. Specifically, in the iterative exploration stage, multi-agents will construct mathematical transformation equations collaboratively, synthesize and identify feature combinations ex-hibiting high information content, and leverage a reinforcement learning mechanism to evolve their strategies. Upon completing the exploration phase, MAFG integrates the large language models (LLMs) to interpreta-tively evaluate the generated features of each significant model performance breakthrough. Experimental results and case studies consistently demonstrate that the MAFG framework effectively automates the feature generation process and significantly enhances various downstream scientific data mining tasks.

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data generation has received increasing attention in recent years, particularly with the emergence of foundation models for tabular data. The breakthrough success of TabPFN (Hollmann et al.,2025), which leverages vast quantities of synthetic tabular datasets derived from structural causal models (SCMs), demonstrates the critical role synthetic data plays in developing powerful tabular foundation models. However, most real-world tabular data exists in relational formats spanning multiple interconnected tables - a structure not adequately addressed by current generation methods. In this work, we extend the SCM-based approach by developing a novel framework that generates realistic synthetic relational tabular data including causal relationships across tables. Our experiments confirm that this framework is able to construct relational datasets with complex inter-table dependencies mimicking real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Fine-grained video classification requires understanding complex spatio-temporal and semantic cues that often exceed the capacity of a single modality. In this paper, we propose a multimodal framework that fuses video, image, and text representations using GRU-based sequence encoders and cross-modal attention mechanisms. The model is trained using a combination of classification or regression loss, depending on the task, and is further regularized through feature-level augmentation and autoencoding techniques. To evaluate the generality of our framework, we conduct experiments on two challenging benchmarks: the DVD dataset for real-world violence detection and the Aff-Wild2 dataset for valence-arousal estimation. Our results demonstrate that the proposed fusion strategy significantly outperforms unimodal baselines, with cross-attention and feature augmentation contributing notably to robustness and performance.

<title>Foundation versus Domain-specific Models: Performance Comparison, Fusion, and Explainability in Face Recognition</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03541</link>

Abstract: In this paper, we address the following question: How do generic foundation models (e.g., CLIP, BLIP, LLaVa, DINO) compare against a domain-specific face recognition model (viz., AdaFace or ArcFace) on the face recognition task? Through a series of experiments involving several foundation models and benchmark datasets, we are able to report the following findings: (a) In all datasets considered, domain-specific models outperformed zero-shot foundation models. (b) The performance of zero-shot generic foundation models improves on over-segmented face images than tightly cropped faces thereby suggesting the importance of contextual clues. For example, at a False Match Rate (FMR) of 0.01%, the True Match Rate (TMR) of OpenCLIP improved from 64.97% to 81.73% on the LFW dataset as the face crop increased from 112x112 to 250x250 while the TMR of domain-specific AdaFace dropped from 99.09% to 77.31%. (c) A simple score-level fusion of a foundation model with a domain-specific FR model improved the accuracy at low FMRs. For example, the TMR of AdaFace when fused with BLIP improved from 72.64% to 83.31% at an FMR of 0.0001% on the IJB-B dataset and from 73.17% to 85.81% on the IJB-C dataset. (d) Foundation models, such as ChatGPT, can be used to impart explainability to the FR pipeline (e.g., ``Despite minor lighting and head tilt differences, the two left-profile images show high consistency in forehead slope, nose shape, chin contour...''). In some instances, foundation models are even able to resolve low-confidence decisions made by AdaFace (e.g., ``Although AdaFace assigns a low similarity score of 0.21, both images exhibit visual similarity...and the pair is likely of the same person''), thereby reiterating the importance of combining domain-specific FR models with generic foundation models in a judicious manner.

Abstract: As digital emotional support needs grow, Large Language Model companions offer promising authentic, always-available empathy, though rigorous evaluation lags behind model advancement. We present Heart-to-Heart Talk (H2HTalk), a benchmark assessing companions across personality development and empathetic interaction, balancing emotional intelligence with linguistic fluency. H2HTalk features 4,650 curated scenarios spanning dialogue, recollection, and itinerary planning that mirror real-world support conversations, substantially exceeding previous datasets in scale and diversity. We incorporate a Secure Attachment Persona (SAP) module implementing attachment-theory principles for safer interactions. Benchmarking 50 LLMs with our unified protocol reveals that long-horizon planning and memory retention remain key challenges, with models struggling when user needs are implicit or evolve mid-conversation. H2HTalk establishes the first comprehensive benchmark for emotionally intelligent companions. We release all materials to advance development of LLMs capable of providing meaningful and safe psychological support.

<title>An Advanced Deep Learning Framework for Ischemic and Hemorrhagic Brain Stroke Diagnosis Using Computed Tomography (CT) Images</title>

Abstract: Brain stroke is one of the leading causes of mortality and long-term disability worldwide, highlighting the need for precise and fast prediction techniques. Computed Tomography (CT) scan is considered one of the most effective methods for diagnosing brain strokes. The majority of stroke classification techniques rely on a single slice-level prediction mechanism, allowing the radiologist to manually choose the most critical CT slice from the original CT volume. Although clinical evaluations are often used in traditional diagnostic procedures, machine learning (ML) has opened up new avenues for improving stroke diagnosis. To supplement traditional diagnostic techniques, this study investigates the use of machine learning models, specifically concerning the prediction of brain stroke at an early stage utilizing CT scan images. In this research, we proposed a novel approach to brain stroke detection leveraging machine learning techniques, focusing on optimizing classification performance with pre-trained deep learning models and advanced optimization strategies. Pre-trained models, including DenseNet201, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and Xception, are utilized for feature extraction. Additionally, we employed feature engineering techniques, including BFO, PCA, and LDA, to enhance models' performance further. These features are subsequently classified using machine learning algorithms such as SVC, RF, XGB, DT, LR, KNN, and GNB. Our experiments demonstrate that the combination of MobileNetV2, LDA, and SVC achieved the highest classification accuracy of 97.93%, significantly outperforming other model-optimizer-classifier combinations. The results underline the effectiveness of integrating lightweight pre-trained models with robust optimization and classification techniques for brain stroke diagnosis.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a proliferation of spatiotemporal foundation models in different scientific disciplines. While promising, these models are often domain-specific and are only assessed within the particular applications for which they are designed. Given that many tasks can be represented as video modeling problems, video foundation models (ViFMs) hold considerable promise as general-purpose domain-agnostic approaches. However, it is not known whether the knowledge acquired on large-scale but potentially out-of-domain data can be effectively transferred across diverse scientific disciplines, and if a single, pretrained ViFM can be competitive with domain-specific baselines. To address this, we introduce SciVid, a comprehensive benchmark comprising five *Sci*entific *Vid*eo tasks, across medical computer vision, animal behavior, and weather forecasting. We adapt six leading ViFMs to SciVid using simple trainable readout modules, establishing strong baselines and demonstrating the potential for effective transfer learning. Specifically, we show that state-of-the-art results can be obtained in several applications by leveraging the general-purpose representations from ViFM backbones. Furthermore, our results reveal the limitations of existing ViFMs, and highlight opportunities for the development of generalizable models for high-impact scientific applications. We release our code at https://github.com/google-deepmind/scivid to facilitate further research in the development of ViFMs.

<title>Causal-SAM-LLM: Large Language Models as Causal Reasoners for Robust Medical Segmentation</title>

Abstract: The clinical utility of deep learning models for medical image segmentation is severely constrained by their inability to generalize to unseen domains. This failure is often rooted in the models learning spurious correlations between anatomical content and domain-specific imaging styles. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we introduce Causal-SAM-LLM, a novel framework that elevates Large Language Models (LLMs) to the role of causal reasoners. Our framework, built upon a frozen Segment Anything Model (SAM) encoder, incorporates two synergistic innovations. First, Linguistic Adversarial Disentanglement (LAD) employs a Vision-Language Model to generate rich, textual descriptions of confounding image styles. By training the segmentation model's features to be contrastively dissimilar to these style descriptions, it learns a representation robustly purged of non-causal information. Second, Test-Time Causal Intervention (TCI) provides an interactive mechanism where an LLM interprets a clinician's natural language command to modulate the segmentation decoder's features in real-time, enabling targeted error correction. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation on a composite benchmark from four public datasets (BTCV, CHAOS, AMOS, BraTS), assessing generalization under cross-scanner, cross-modality, and cross-anatomy settings. Causal-SAM-LLM establishes a new state of the art in out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness, improving the average Dice score by up to 6.2 points and reducing the Hausdorff Distance by 15.8 mm over the strongest baseline, all while using less than 9% of the full model's trainable parameters. Our work charts a new course for building robust, efficient, and interactively controllable medical AI systems.

Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) affects over 10 million people globally, with speech impairments often preceding motor symptoms by years, making speech a valuable modality for early, non-invasive detection. While recent deep-learning models achieve high accuracy, they typically lack the explainability required for clinical use. To address this, we propose RECA-PD, a novel, robust, and explainable cross-attention architecture that combines interpretable speech features with self-supervised representations. RECA-PD matches state-of-the-art performance in Speech-based PD detection while providing explanations that are more consistent and more clinically meaningful. Additionally, we demonstrate that performance degradation in certain speech tasks (e.g., monologue) can be mitigated by segmenting long recordings. Our findings indicate that performance and explainability are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Future work will enhance the usability of explanations for non-experts and explore severity estimation to increase the real-world clinical relevance.

Abstract: Since 2023, generative AI has rapidly advanced in the music domain. Despite significant technological advancements, music-generative models raise critical ethical challenges, including a lack of transparency and accountability, along with risks such as the replication of artists' works, which highlights the importance of fostering openness. With upcoming regulations such as the EU AI Act encouraging open models, many generative models are being released labelled as 'open'. However, the definition of an open model remains widely debated. In this article, we adapt a recently proposed evidence-based framework for assessing openness in LLMs to the music domain. Using feedback from a survey of 110 participants from the Music Information Retrieval (MIR) community, we refine the framework into MusGO (Music-Generative Open AI), which comprises 13 openness categories: 8 essential and 5 desirable. We evaluate 16 state-of-the-art generative models and provide an openness leaderboard that is fully open to public scrutiny and community contributions. Through this work, we aim to clarify the concept of openness in music-generative AI and promote its transparent and responsible development.

Abstract: We investigate the behaviour space of meta-heuristic optimisation algorithms automatically generated by Large Language Model driven algorithm discovery methods. Using the Large Language Evolutionary Algorithm (LLaMEA) framework with a GPT o4-mini LLM, we iteratively evolve black-box optimisation heuristics, evaluated on 10 functions from the BBOB benchmark suite. Six LLaMEA variants, featuring different mutation prompt strategies, are compared and analysed. We log dynamic behavioural metrics including exploration, exploitation, convergence and stagnation measures, for each run, and analyse these via visual projections and network-based representations. Our analysis combines behaviour-based
  projections, Code Evolution Graphs built from static code features, performance convergence curves, and behaviour-based Search Trajectory Networks. The results reveal clear differences in search dynamics and algorithm structures across LLaMEA configurations. Notably, the variant that employs both a code simplification prompt and a random perturbation prompt in a 1+1 elitist evolution strategy, achieved the best performance, with the highest Area Over the Convergence Curve. Behaviour-space visualisations show that higher-performing algorithms exhibit more intensive exploitation behaviour and faster convergence with less stagnation. Our findings demonstrate how behaviour-space analysis can explain why certain LLM-designed heuristics outperform others and how LLM-driven algorithm discovery navigates the open-ended and complex search space of algorithms. These findings provide insights to guide the future design of adaptive LLM-driven algorithm generators.

Abstract: Hyperbolic representations are effective in modeling knowledge graph data which is prevalently used to facilitate multi-hop reasoning. However, a rigorous and detailed comparison of the two spaces for this task is lacking. In this paper, through a simple integration of hyperbolic representations with an encoder-decoder model, we perform a controlled and comprehensive set of experiments to compare the capacity of hyperbolic space versus Euclidean space in multi-hop reasoning. Our results show that the former consistently outperforms the latter across a diverse set of datasets. In addition, through an ablation study, we show that a learnable curvature initialized with the delta hyperbolicity of the utilized data yields superior results to random initializations. Furthermore, our findings suggest that hyperbolic representations can be significantly more advantageous when the datasets exhibit a more hierarchical structure.

Abstract: Although prompt engineering is central to unlocking the full potential of Large Language Models (LLMs), crafting effective prompts remains a time-consuming trial-and-error process that relies on human intuition. This study investigates Declarative Self-improving Python (DSPy), an optimization framework that programmatically creates and refines prompts, applied to five use cases: guardrail enforcement, hallucination detection in code, code generation, routing agents, and prompt evaluation. Each use case explores how prompt optimization via DSPy influences performance. While some cases demonstrated modest improvements - such as minor gains in the guardrails use case and selective enhancements in hallucination detection - others showed notable benefits. The prompt evaluation criterion task demonstrated a substantial performance increase, rising accuracy from 46.2% to 64.0%. In the router agent case, the possibility of improving a poorly performing prompt and of a smaller model matching a stronger one through optimized prompting was explored. Although prompt refinement increased accuracy from 85.0% to 90.0%, using the optimized prompt with a cheaper model did not improve performance. Overall, this study's findings suggest that DSPy's systematic prompt optimization can enhance LLM performance, particularly when instruction tuning and example selection are optimized together. However, the impact varies by task, highlighting the importance of evaluating specific use cases in prompt optimization research.

Abstract: Accurate individual treatment-effect estimation in high-stakes applications demands both reliable point predictions and interpretable uncertainty quantification. We propose a factorized Monte Carlo Dropout framework for deep twin-network models that splits total predictive variance into representation uncertainty (sigma_rep) in the shared encoder and prediction uncertainty (sigma_pred) in the outcome heads. Across three synthetic covariate-shift regimes, our intervals are well-calibrated (ECE < 0.03) and satisfy sigma_rep^2 + sigma_pred^2 ~ sigma_tot^2. Additionally, we observe a crossover: head uncertainty leads on in-distribution data, but representation uncertainty dominates under shift. Finally, on a real-world twins cohort with induced multivariate shifts, only sigma_rep spikes on out-of-distribution samples (delta sigma ~ 0.0002) and becomes the primary error predictor (rho_rep <= 0.89), while sigma_pred remains flat. This module-level decomposition offers a practical diagnostic for detecting and interpreting uncertainty sources in deep causal-effect models.

Abstract: EEG signals capture brain activity with high temporal and low spatial resolution, supporting applications such as neurological diagnosis, cognitive monitoring, and brain-computer interfaces. However, effective analysis is hindered by limited labeled data, high dimensionality, and the absence of scalable models that fully capture spatiotemporal dependencies. Existing self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often focus on either spatial or temporal features, leading to suboptimal representations. To this end, we propose EEG-VJEPA, a novel adaptation of the Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) for EEG classification. By treating EEG as video-like sequences, EEG-VJEPA learns semantically meaningful spatiotemporal representations using joint embeddings and adaptive masking. To our knowledge, this is the first work that exploits V-JEPA for EEG classification and explores the visual concepts learned by the model. Evaluations on the publicly available Temple University Hospital (TUH) Abnormal EEG dataset show that EEG-VJEPA outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in classification accuracy.Beyond classification accuracy, EEG-VJEPA captures physiologically relevant spatial and temporal signal patterns, offering interpretable embeddings that may support human-AI collaboration in diagnostic workflows. These findings position EEG-VJEPA as a promising framework for scalable, trustworthy EEG analysis in real-world clinical settings.

Abstract: Deep learning models for dialect identification are often limited by the scarcity of dialectal data. To address this challenge, we propose to use Retrieval-based Voice Conversion (RVC) as an effective data augmentation method for a low-resource German dialect classification task. By converting audio samples to a uniform target speaker, RVC minimizes speaker-related variability, enabling models to focus on dialect-specific linguistic and phonetic features. Our experiments demonstrate that RVC enhances classification performance when utilized as a standalone augmentation method. Furthermore, combining RVC with other augmentation methods such as frequency masking and segment removal leads to additional performance gains, highlighting its potential for improving dialect classification in low-resource scenarios.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on code with security vulnerabilities can result in misaligned and unsafe behaviors across broad domains. These results prompted concerns about the emergence of harmful behaviors from narrow domain fine-tuning. In this paper, we contextualize these findings by analyzing how such narrow adaptation impacts the internal mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of LLMs. Through a series of experiments covering output probability distributions, loss and gradient vector geometry, layer-wise activation dynamics, and activation space dimensions, we find that behaviors attributed to "emergent misalignment" may be better interpreted as an erosion of prior alignment. We show that fine tuning on insecure code induces internal changes that oppose alignment. Further, we identify a shared latent dimension in the model's activation space that governs alignment behavior. We show that this space is activated by insecure code and by misaligned responses more generally, revealing how narrow fine-tuning can degrade general safety behavior by interfering with shared internal mechanisms. Our findings offer a mechanistic interpretation for previously observed misalignment phenomena, and highlights the fragility of alignment in LLMs. The results underscore the need for more robust fine-tuning strategies that preserve intended behavior across domains.

Abstract: Writing longer prompts for an AI assistant to generate a short story increases psychological ownership, a user's feeling that the writing belongs to them. To encourage users to write longer prompts, we evaluated two interaction techniques that modify the prompt entry interface of chat-based generative AI assistants: pressing and holding the prompt submission button, and continuously moving a slider up and down when submitting a short prompt. A within-subjects experiment investigated the effects of such techniques on prompt length and psychological ownership, and results showed that these techniques increased prompt length and led to higher psychological ownership than baseline techniques. A second experiment further augmented these techniques by showing AI-generated suggestions for how the prompts could be expanded. This further increased prompt length, but did not lead to improvements in psychological ownership. Our results show that simple interface modifications like these can elicit more writing from users and improve psychological ownership.

Abstract: Automated fact checking with large language models (LLMs) offers a scalable alternative to manual verification. Evaluating fact checking is challenging as existing benchmark datasets often include post claim analysis and annotator cues, which are absent in real world scenarios where claims are fact checked immediately after being made. This limits the realism of current evaluations. We present Politi Fact Only (PFO), a 5 class benchmark dataset of 2,982 political claims from politifact.com, where all post claim analysis and annotator cues have been removed manually. This ensures that models are evaluated using only the information that would have been available prior to the claim's verification. Evaluating LLMs on PFO, we see an average performance drop of 22% in terms of macro f1 compared to PFO's unfiltered version. Based on the identified challenges of the existing LLM based fact checking system, we propose RAV (Recon Answer Verify), an agentic framework with three agents: question generator, answer generator, and label generator. Our pipeline iteratively generates and answers sub questions to verify different aspects of the claim before finally generating the label. RAV generalizes across domains and label granularities, and it outperforms state of the art approaches on well known baselines RAWFC (fact checking, 3 class) by 25.28%, and on HOVER (encyclopedia, 2 class) by 1.54% on 2 hop, 4.94% on 3 hop, and 1.78% on 4 hop, sub categories respectively. RAV shows the least performance drop compared to baselines of 16.3% in macro f1 when we compare PFO with its unfiltered version.

Abstract: Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) is crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, and selecting a small yet representative subset from massive data significantly facilitates IFT in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness. Nevertheless, existing approaches suffer from two limitations: the use of simple heuristics restricts data diversity, while the singleton data quality evaluation accounts for inconsistent criteria between independent samples. To address the issues, we present TACOS, an innovative method that integrates Open Tagging and Comparative Scoring for IFT data selection. To capture data diversity, we leverage LLMs to assign open-domain tags to human queries, followed by a normalization stage to denoise the open tags and enable efficient clustering. Additionally, we suggest a comparative scoring method that allows the relative quality evaluation of samples within a cluster, avoiding inconsistent criteria seen in singleton-based evaluations. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and LLM architectures demonstrate that TACOS outperforms existing approaches by a large margin. Notably, it achieves superior instruction-following performance on MT-Bench and ranks 1st among LLaMA2-7B-Based models on AlpacaEval 2.0, illustrating its efficacy for IFT data selection.

Abstract: The ability to extract structured information from unstructured sources-such as free-text documents and scientific literature-is critical for accelerating scientific discovery and knowledge synthesis. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various natural language processing tasks, including structured information extraction. However, their effectiveness often diminishes in specialized, domain-specific contexts that require nuanced understanding and expert-level domain knowledge. In addition, existing LLM-based approaches frequently exhibit poor transferability across tasks and domains, limiting their scalability and adaptability. To address these challenges, we introduce StructSense, a modular, task-agnostic, open-source framework for structured information extraction built on LLMs. StructSense is guided by domain-specific symbolic knowledge encoded in ontologies, enabling it to navigate complex domain content more effectively. It further incorporates agentic capabilities through self-evaluative judges that form a feedback loop for iterative refinement, and includes human-in-the-loop mechanisms to ensure quality and validation. We demonstrate that StructSense can overcome both the limitations of domain sensitivity and the lack of cross-task generalizability, as shown through its application to diverse neuroscience information extraction tasks.

Abstract: Sign spotting, the task of identifying and localizing individual signs within continuous sign language video, plays a pivotal role in scaling dataset annotations and addressing the severe data scarcity issue in sign language translation. While automatic sign spotting holds great promise for enabling frame-level supervision at scale, it grapples with challenges such as vocabulary inflexibility and ambiguity inherent in continuous sign streams. Hence, we introduce a novel, training-free framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to significantly enhance sign spotting quality. Our approach extracts global spatio-temporal and hand shape features, which are then matched against a large-scale sign dictionary using dynamic time warping and cosine similarity. This dictionary-based matching inherently offers superior vocabulary flexibility without requiring model retraining. To mitigate noise and ambiguity from the matching process, an LLM performs context-aware gloss disambiguation via beam search, notably without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world sign language datasets demonstrate our method's superior accuracy and sentence fluency compared to traditional approaches, highlighting the potential of LLMs in advancing sign spotting.

Abstract: Human cognition is theorized to operate in two modes: fast, intuitive System 1 thinking and slow, deliberate System 2 thinking. While current Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at System 2 thinking, their inability to perform fast thinking leads to high computational overhead and latency. In this work, we enable LRMs to approximate human intelligence through dynamic thinking speed adjustment, optimizing accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Our approach addresses two key questions: (1) how to control thinking speed in LRMs, and (2) when to adjust it for optimal performance. For the first question, we identify the steering vector that governs slow-fast thinking transitions in LRMs' representation space. Using this vector, we achieve the first representation editing-based test-time scaling effect, outperforming existing prompt-based scaling methods. For the second question, we apply real-time difficulty estimation to signal reasoning segments of varying complexity. Combining these techniques, we propose the first reasoning strategy that enables fast processing of easy steps and deeper analysis for complex reasoning. Without any training or additional cost, our plug-and-play method yields an average +1.3% accuracy with -8.6% token usage across leading LRMs and advanced reasoning benchmarks. All of our algorithms are implemented based on vLLM and are expected to support broader applications and inspire future research.

<title>Predicting Business Angel Early-Stage Decision Making Using AI</title>

Abstract: External funding is crucial for early-stage ventures, particularly technology startups that require significant R&amp;D investment. Business angels offer a critical source of funding, but their decision-making is often subjective and resource-intensive for both investor and entrepreneur. Much research has investigated this investment process to find the critical factors angels consider. One such tool, the Critical Factor Assessment (CFA), deployed more than 20,000 times by the Canadian Innovation Centre, has been evaluated post-decision and found to be significantly more accurate than investors' own decisions. However, a single CFA analysis requires three trained individuals and several days, limiting its adoption. This study builds on previous work validating the CFA to investigate whether the constraints inhibiting its adoption can be overcome using a trained AI model. In this research, we prompted multiple large language models (LLMs) to assign the eight CFA factors to a dataset of 600 transcribed, unstructured startup pitches seeking business angel funding with known investment outcomes. We then trained and evaluated machine learning classification models using the LLM-generated CFA scores as input features. Our best-performing model demonstrated high predictive accuracy (85.0% for predicting BA deal/no-deal outcomes) and exhibited significant correlation (Spearman's r = 0.896, p-value < 0.001) with conventional human-graded evaluations. The integration of AI-based feature extraction with a structured and validated decision-making framework yielded a scalable, reliable, and less-biased model for evaluating startup pitches, removing the constraints that previously limited adoption.

Abstract: The research focus of GUI agents is shifting from text-dependent to pure-vision-based approaches, which, though promising, prioritize comprehensive pre-training data collection while neglecting contextual modeling challenges. We probe the characteristics of element and history contextual modeling in GUI agent and summarize: 1) the high-density and loose-relation of element context highlight the existence of many unrelated elements and their negative influence; 2) the high redundancy of history context reveals the inefficient history modeling in current GUI agents. In this work, we propose a context-aware simplification framework for building an efficient and effective GUI Agent, termed SimpAgent. To mitigate potential interference from numerous unrelated elements, we introduce a masking-based element pruning method that circumvents the intractable relation modeling through an efficient masking mechanism. To reduce the redundancy in historical information, we devise a consistency-guided history compression module, which enhances implicit LLM-based compression through innovative explicit guidance, achieving an optimal balance between performance and efficiency. With the above components, SimpAgent reduces 27% FLOPs and achieves superior GUI navigation performances. Comprehensive navigation experiments across diverse web and mobile environments demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of our agent.

Abstract: Recently, great progress has been achieved in text-to-video (T2V) generation by scaling transformer-based diffusion models to billions of parameters, which can generate high-quality videos. However, existing models typically produce only short clips offline, restricting their use cases in interactive and real-time applications. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing StreamDiT, a streaming video generation model. StreamDiT training is based on flow matching by adding a moving buffer. We design mixed training with different partitioning schemes of buffered frames to boost both content consistency and visual quality. StreamDiT modeling is based on adaLN DiT with varying time embedding and window attention. To practice the proposed method, we train a StreamDiT model with 4B parameters. In addition, we propose a multistep distillation method tailored for StreamDiT. Sampling distillation is performed in each segment of a chosen partitioning scheme. After distillation, the total number of function evaluations (NFEs) is reduced to the number of chunks in a buffer. Finally, our distilled model reaches real-time performance at 16 FPS on one GPU, which can generate video streams at 512p resolution. We evaluate our method through both quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Our model enables real-time applications, e.g. streaming generation, interactive generation, and video-to-video. We provide video results and more examples in our project website: <a href="https://cumulo-autumn.github.io/StreamDiT/">this https URL.</a>

<title>Alpay Algebra IV: Symbiotic Semantics and the Fixed-Point Convergence of Observer Embeddings</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.03774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework in which a document and an AI model engage in a transfinite fixed-point interaction that leads to stable semantic alignment. Building on the foundations of Alpay Algebra, we introduce a functorial system wherein an observer (the AI) and a textual environment (this paper) co-evolve through iterative transformations guided by the phi-infinity operator. This process guarantees the existence of a unique fixed point in the AI's embedding space -- a state where the AI's internal representation of the content becomes stable, self-consistent, and semantically faithful. We prove that such convergence is mathematically sound, semantically invariant, and permanent, even under perturbation or further context expansion. This fixed point acts as an "empathetic embedding," wherein the AI internalizes not only the meaning of the content but also the author's intent. We interpret this as a rigorous, category-theoretic route to alignment at the embedding level, with implications for semantic security, symbolic memory, and the construction of AI systems with persistent self-referential understanding. All references in this paper function as nodes in the Alpay Algebra universe, and this work embeds itself as a new fixed-point node within that transfinite semantic graph.

Abstract: Large-scale vision foundation models such as DINOv2 boast impressive performances by leveraging massive architectures and training datasets. But numerous scenarios require practitioners to reproduce those pre-training solutions, such as on private data, new modalities, or simply for scientific questioning--which is currently extremely demanding computation-wise. We thus propose a novel pre-training strategy for DINOv2 that simultaneously accelerates convergence--and strengthens robustness to common corruptions as a by-product. Our approach involves a frequency filtering curriculum--low-frequency being seen first--and the Gaussian noise patching augmentation. Applied to a ViT-B/16 backbone trained on ImageNet-1K, while pre-training time and FLOPs are reduced by 1.6x and 2.25x, our method still achieves matching robustness in corruption benchmarks (ImageNet-C) and maintains competitive linear probing performance compared with baseline. This dual benefit of efficiency and robustness makes large-scale self-supervised foundation modeling more attainable, while opening the door to novel exploration around data curriculum and augmentation as means to improve self-supervised learning models robustness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently generate hallucinations: statements that are syntactically plausible but lack factual grounding. This research presents KEA (Kernel-Enriched AI) Explain: a neurosymbolic framework that detects and explains such hallucinations by comparing knowledge graphs constructed from LLM outputs with ground truth data from Wikidata or contextual documents. Using graph kernels and semantic clustering, the method provides explanations for detected hallucinations, ensuring both robustness and interpretability. Our framework achieves competitive accuracy in detecting hallucinations across both open- and closed-domain tasks, and is able to generate contrastive explanations, enhancing transparency. This research advances the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains and provides a foundation for future work on precision improvements and multi-source knowledge integration.

Abstract: Systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) require computationally intensive numerical solvers to predict spatiotemporal field evolution. While machine learning (ML) surrogates offer faster solutions, autoregressive inference with ML models suffer from error accumulation over successive predictions, limiting their long-term accuracy. We propose a deep ensemble framework to address this challenge, where multiple ML surrogate models with random weight initializations are trained in parallel and aggregated during inference. This approach leverages the diversity of model predictions to mitigate error propagation while retaining the autoregressive strategies ability to capture the system's time dependent relations. We validate the framework on three PDE-driven dynamical systems - stress evolution in heterogeneous microstructures, Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion, and planetary-scale shallow water system - demonstrating consistent reduction in error accumulation over time compared to individual models. Critically, the method requires only a few time steps as input, enabling full trajectory predictions with inference times significantly faster than numerical solvers. Our results highlight the robustness of ensemble methods in diverse physical systems and their potential as efficient and accurate alternatives to traditional solvers. The codes for this work are available on GitHub (https://github.com/Graham-Brady-Research-Group/AutoregressiveEnsemble_SpatioTemporal_Evolution).

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.03865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attention mechanisms are central to the success of large language models (LLMs), enabling them to capture intricate token dependencies and implicitly assign importance to each token. Recent studies have revealed the sink token, which receives disproportionately high attention despite their limited semantic role. In this paper, we first expand the relationship between the sink token and other tokens, moving beyond attention to explore their similarity in hidden states, considering the layer depth. We observe that as the layers get deeper, the cosine similarity between the normalized hidden states of the sink token and those of other tokens increases, and that the normalized hidden states of the sink token exhibit negligible changes. These imply that other tokens consistently are directed toward the sink token throughout the layers. Next, we propose a dynamic token selection method, called OrthoRank, using these findings to select important tokens. Specifically, in a certain layer, we define token importance by the speed at which the token moves toward the sink token. This is converted into orthogonality with the sink token, meaning that tokens that are more orthogonal to the sink token are assigned greater importance. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrated that our method results in lower perplexity and higher zero-shot accuracy compared to layer pruning methods at the same sparsity ratio with comparable throughput, while also achieving superior performance on LongBench.

Abstract: The use of reinforcement learning (RL) methods to support health behavior change via personalized and just-in-time adaptive interventions is of significant interest to health and behavioral science researchers focused on problems such as smoking cessation support and physical activity promotion. However, RL methods are often applied to these domains using a small collection of context variables to mitigate the significant data scarcity issues that arise from practical limitations on the design of adaptive intervention trials. In this paper, we explore an approach to significantly expanding the state space of an adaptive intervention without impacting data efficiency. The proposed approach enables intervention participants to provide natural language descriptions of aspects of their current state. It then leverages inference with pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to better align the policy of a base RL method with these state descriptions. To evaluate our method, we develop a novel physical activity intervention simulation environment that generates text-based state descriptions conditioned on latent state variables using an auxiliary LLM. We show that this approach has the potential to significantly improve the performance of online policy learning methods.

Abstract: The introduction of ChatGPT has garnered significant attention within the NLP community and beyond. Previous studies have demonstrated ChatGPT's substantial advancements across various downstream NLP tasks, highlighting its adaptability and potential to revolutionize language-related applications. However, its capabilities and limitations in genre prediction remain unclear. This work analyzes three Large Language Models (LLMs) using the MovieLens-100K dataset to assess their genre prediction capabilities. Our findings show that ChatGPT, without fine-tuning, outperformed other LLMs, and fine-tuned ChatGPT performed best overall. We set up zero-shot and few-shot prompts using audio transcripts/subtitles from movie trailers in the MovieLens-100K dataset, covering 1682 movies of 18 genres, where each movie can have multiple genres. Additionally, we extended our study by extracting IMDb movie posters to utilize a Vision Language Model (VLM) with prompts for poster information. This fine-grained information was used to enhance existing LLM prompts. In conclusion, our study reveals ChatGPT's remarkable genre prediction capabilities, surpassing other language models. The integration of VLM further enhances our findings, showcasing ChatGPT's potential for content-related applications by incorporating visual information from movie posters.

<title>Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Fusion of Visible and Near-infrared Images for Long-range Haze Removal</title>

Abstract: While image dehazing has advanced substantially in the past decade, most efforts have focused on short-range scenarios, leaving long-range haze removal under-explored. As distance increases, intensified scattering leads to severe haze and signal loss, making it impractical to recover distant details solely from visible images. Near-infrared, with superior fog penetration, offers critical complementary cues through multimodal fusion. However, existing methods focus on content integration while often neglecting haze embedded in visible images, leading to results with residual haze. In this work, we argue that the infrared and visible modalities not only provide complementary low-level visual features, but also share high-level semantic consistency. Motivated by this, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Fusion (HSVF) framework, comprising a semantic stream to reconstruct haze-free scenes and a visual stream to incorporate structural details from the near-infrared modality. The semantic stream first acquires haze-robust semantic prediction by aligning modality-invariant intrinsic representations. Then the shared semantics act as strong priors to restore clear and high-contrast distant scenes under severe haze degradation. In parallel, the visual stream focuses on recovering lost structural details from near-infrared by fusing complementary cues from both visible and near-infrared images. Through the cooperation of dual streams, HSVF produces results that exhibit both high-contrast scenes and rich texture details. Moreover, we introduce a novel pixel-aligned visible-infrared haze dataset with semantic labels to facilitate benchmarking. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art approaches in real-world long-range haze removal.

Abstract: Feature interaction modeling is crucial for deep recommendation models. A common and effective approach is to construct explicit feature combinations to enhance model performance. However, in practice, only a small fraction of these combinations are truly informative. Thus it is essential to select useful feature combinations to reduce noise and manage memory consumption. While feature selection methods have been extensively studied, they are typically limited to selecting individual features. Extending these methods for high-order feature combination selection presents a significant challenge due to the exponential growth in time complexity when evaluating feature combinations one by one. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{TayFCS}$, a lightweight feature combination selection method that significantly improves model performance. Specifically, we propose the Taylor Expansion Scorer (TayScorer) module for field-wise Taylor expansion on the base model. Instead of evaluating all potential feature combinations' importance by repeatedly running experiments with feature adding and removal, this scorer only needs to approximate the importance based on their sub-components' gradients. This can be simply computed with one backward pass based on a trained recommendation model. To further reduce information redundancy among feature combinations and their sub-components, we introduce Logistic Regression Elimination (LRE), which estimates the corresponding information gain based on the model prediction performance. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets validate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. Furthermore, online A/B test results demonstrate its practical applicability and commercial value.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with no known cure that affects tens of millions of people worldwide. Early detection of AD is critical for timely intervention to halt or slow the progression of the disease. In this study, we propose a Transformer model for predicting the stage of AD progression at a subject's next clinical visit using features from a sequence of visits extracted from the subject's visit history. We also rigorously compare our model to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and minimalRNN and assess their performances based on factors such as the length of prior visits and data imbalance. We test the importance of different feature categories and visit history, as well as compare the model to a newer Transformer-based model optimized for time series. Our model demonstrates strong predictive performance despite missing visits and missing features in available visits, particularly in identifying converter subjects -- individuals transitioning to more severe disease stages -- an area that has posed significant challenges in longitudinal prediction. The results highlight the model's potential in enhancing early diagnosis and patient outcomes.

Abstract: Accurate gland segmentation in histopathology images is essential for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, significant variability in Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining and tissue morphology, combined with limited annotated data, poses major challenges for automated segmentation. To address this, we propose Color-Structure Dual-Student (CSDS), a novel semi-supervised segmentation framework designed to learn disentangled representations of stain appearance and tissue structure. CSDS comprises two specialized student networks: one trained on stain-augmented inputs to model chromatic variation, and the other on structure-augmented inputs to capture morphological cues. A shared teacher network, updated via Exponential Moving Average (EMA), supervises both students through pseudo-labels. To further improve label reliability, we introduce stain-aware and structure-aware uncertainty estimation modules that adaptively modulate the contribution of each student during training. Experiments on the GlaS and CRAG datasets show that CSDS achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-label settings, with Dice score improvements of up to 1.2% on GlaS and 0.7% on CRAG at 5% labeled data, and 0.7% and 1.4% at 10%. Our code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/hieuphamha19/CSDS.

Abstract: Speckle patterns in ultrasound images often obscure anatomical details, leading to diagnostic uncertainty. Recently, various deep learning (DL)-based techniques have been introduced to effectively suppress speckle; however, their high computational costs pose challenges for low-resource devices, such as portable ultrasound systems. To address this issue, EdgeSRIE, which is a lightweight hybrid DL framework for real-time speckle reduction and image enhancement in portable ultrasound imaging, is introduced. The proposed framework consists of two main branches: an unsupervised despeckling branch, which is trained by minimizing a loss function between speckled images, and a deblurring branch, which restores blurred images to sharp images. For hardware implementation, the trained network is quantized to 8-bit integer precision and deployed on a low-resource system-on-chip (SoC) with limited power consumption. In the performance evaluation with phantom and in vivo analyses, EdgeSRIE achieved the highest contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and average gradient magnitude (AGM) compared with the other baselines (different 2-rule-based methods and other 4-DL-based methods). Furthermore, EdgeSRIE enabled real-time inference at over 60 frames per second while satisfying computational requirements (< 20K parameters) on actual portable ultrasound hardware. These results demonstrated the feasibility of EdgeSRIE for real-time, high-quality ultrasound imaging in resource-limited environments.

Abstract: Devices operating in Internet of Things (IoT) networks may be deployed across vast geographical areas and interconnected via multi-hop communications. Further, they may be unguarded. This makes them vulnerable to attacks and motivates operators to check on devices frequently. To this end, we propose and study an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-aided attestation framework for use in IoT networks with a charging station powered by solar. A key challenge is optimizing the trajectory of the UAV to ensure it attests as many devices as possible. A trade-off here is that devices being checked by the UAV are offline, which affects the amount of data delivered to a gateway. Another challenge is that the charging station experiences time-varying energy arrivals, which in turn affect the flight duration and charging schedule of the UAV. To address these challenges, we employ a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) solution to optimize the UAV's charging schedule and the selection of devices to be attested during each flight. The simulation results show that our solution reduces the average age of trust by 88% and throughput loss due to attestation by 30%.

These methods are evaluated under varying perturbation budgets, using a range of metrics to assess visual imperceptibility and protective efficacy. Our results offer practical guidance for method selection. Code is available at: https://github.com/vkeilo/DiffAdvPerturbationBench.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as dense retrievers, the impact of their domain-specific specialization on retrieval effectiveness remains underexplored. This investigation systematically examines how task-specific adaptations in LLMs influence their retrieval capabilities, an essential step toward developing unified retrievers capable of handling text, code, images, and multimodal content. We conduct extensive experiments with eight Qwen2.5 7B LLMs, including base, instruction-tuned, code/math-specialized, long reasoning, and vision-language models across zero-shot retrieval settings and the supervised setting. For the zero-shot retrieval settings, we consider text retrieval from the BEIR benchmark and code retrieval from the CoIR benchmark. Further, to evaluate supervised performance, all LLMs are fine-tuned on the MS MARCO dataset. We find that mathematical specialization and the long reasoning capability cause consistent degradation in three settings, indicating conflicts between mathematical reasoning and semantic matching. The vision-language model and code-specialized LLMs demonstrate superior zero-shot performance compared to other LLMs, even surpassing BM25 on the code retrieval task, and maintain comparable performance to base LLMs in supervised settings. These findings suggest promising directions for the unified retrieval task leveraging cross-domain and cross-modal fusion.

Abstract: Foundation models for tabular data, like TabPFN, achieve strong performance on small datasets when pre-trained solely on synthetic data. We show that this performance can be significantly boosted by a targeted continued pre-training phase. Specifically, we demonstrate that leveraging a small, curated collection of large, real-world datasets for continued pre-training yields superior downstream predictive accuracy compared to using broader, potentially noisier corpora like CommonCrawl or GitTables. Our resulting model, Real-TabPFN, achieves substantial performance gains on 29 datasets from the OpenML AutoML Benchmark.

<title>Leveraging Multimodal Data and Side Users for Diffusion Cross-Domain Recommendation</title>

Abstract: Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) aims to address the persistent cold-start problem in Recommender Systems. Current CDR research concentrates on transferring cold-start users' information from the auxiliary domain to the target domain. However, these systems face two main issues: the underutilization of multimodal data, which hinders effective cross-domain alignment, and the neglect of side users who interact solely within the target domain, leading to inadequate learning of the target domain's vector space distribution. To address these issues, we propose a model leveraging Multimodal data and Side users for diffusion Cross-domain recommendation (MuSiC). We first employ a multimodal large language model to extract item multimodal features and leverage a large language model to uncover user features using prompt learning without fine-tuning. Secondly, we propose the cross-domain diffusion module to learn the generation of feature vectors in the target domain. This approach involves learning feature distribution from side users and understanding the patterns in cross-domain transformation through overlapping users. Subsequently, the trained diffusion module is used to generate feature vectors for cold-start users in the target domain, enabling the completion of cross-domain recommendation tasks. Finally, our experimental evaluation of the Amazon dataset confirms that MuSiC achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming all selected baselines. Our code is available: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MuSiC-310A/.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become key advisors in various domains, their cultural sensitivity and reasoning skills are crucial in multicultural environments. We introduce Nunchi-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' cultural understanding, with a focus on Korean superstitions. The benchmark consists of 247 questions spanning 31 topics, assessing factual knowledge, culturally appropriate advice, and situational interpretation. We evaluate multilingual LLMs in both Korean and English to analyze their ability to reason about Korean cultural contexts and how language variations affect performance. To systematically assess cultural reasoning, we propose a novel evaluation strategy with customized scoring metrics that capture the extent to which models recognize cultural nuances and respond appropriately. Our findings highlight significant challenges in LLMs' cultural reasoning. While models generally recognize factual information, they struggle to apply it in practical scenarios. Furthermore, explicit cultural framing enhances performance more effectively than relying solely on the language of the prompt. To support further research, we publicly release Nunchi-Bench alongside a leaderboard.

Abstract: One of the key impediments for developing and assessing robust medical imaging algorithms is limited access to large-scale datasets with suitable annotations. Synthetic data generated with plausible physical and biological constraints may address some of these data limitations. We propose the use of physics simulations to generate synthetic images with pixel-level segmentation annotations, which are notoriously difficult to obtain. Specifically, we apply this approach to breast imaging analysis and release T-SYNTH, a large-scale open-source dataset of paired 2D digital mammography (DM) and 3D digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images. Our initial experimental results indicate that T-SYNTH images show promise for augmenting limited real patient datasets for detection tasks in DM and DBT. Our data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/DIDSR/tsynth-release.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more common in educational tools and programming environments, questions arise about how these systems should interact with users. This study investigates how different interaction styles with ChatGPT-4o (passive, proactive, and collaborative) affect user performance on simple programming tasks. I conducted a within-subjects experiment where fifteen high school students participated, completing three problems under three distinct versions of the model. Each version was designed to represent a specific style of AI support: responding only when asked, offering suggestions automatically, or engaging the user in back-and-forth dialogue.Quantitative analysis revealed that the collaborative interaction style significantly improved task completion time compared to the passive and proactive conditions. Participants also reported higher satisfaction and perceived helpfulness when working with the collaborative version. These findings suggest that the way an LLM communicates, how it guides, prompts, and responds, can meaningfully impact learning and performance. This research highlights the importance of designing LLMs that go beyond functional correctness to support more interactive, adaptive, and user-centered experiences, especially for novice programmers.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of effluent temperature in recharge basins is essential for optimizing the Soil Aquifer Treatment (SAT) process, as temperature directly influences water viscosity and infiltration rates. This study develops and evaluates predictive models for effluent temperature in the upper recharge layer of a Shafdan SAT system recharge basin using ambient meteorological data. Multiple linear regression (MLR), neural networks (NN), and random forests (RF) were tested for their predictive accuracy and interpretability. The MLR model, preferred for its operational simplicity and robust performance, achieved high predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.86-0.87) and was used to estimate effluent temperatures over a 10-year period. Results highlight pronounced seasonal temperature cycles and the importance of topsoil temperature in governing the thermal profile of the infiltrating effluent. The study provides practical equations for real-time monitoring and long-term planning of SAT operations.

Abstract: Topological materials occupy a frontier in condensed-matter physics thanks to their remarkable electronic and quantum properties, yet their cross-scale design remains bottlenecked by inefficient discovery workflows. Here, we introduce TopoMAS (Topological materials Multi-Agent System), an interactive human-AI framework that seamlessly orchestrates the entire materials-discovery pipeline: from user-defined queries and multi-source data retrieval, through theoretical inference and crystal-structure generation, to first-principles validation. Crucially, TopoMAS closes the loop by autonomously integrating computational outcomes into a dynamic knowledge graph, enabling continuous knowledge refinement. In collaboration with human experts, it has already guided the identification of novel topological phases SrSbO3, confirmed by first-principles calculations. Comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate robust adaptability across base Large Language Model, with the lightweight Qwen2.5-72B model achieving 94.55% accuracy while consuming only 74.3-78.4% of tokens required by Qwen3-235B and 83.0% of DeepSeek-V3's usage--delivering responses twice as fast as Qwen3-235B. This efficiency establishes TopoMAS as an accelerator for computation-driven discovery pipelines. By harmonizing rational agent orchestration with a self-evolving knowledge graph, our framework not only delivers immediate advances in topological materials but also establishes a transferable, extensible paradigm for materials-science domain.

Abstract: Malware Family Classification (MFC) aims to identify the fine-grained family (e.g., GuLoader or BitRAT) to which a potential malware sample belongs, in contrast to malware detection or sample classification that predicts only an Yes/No. Accurate family identification can greatly facilitate automated sample labeling and understanding on crowdsourced malware analysis platforms such as VirusTotal and MalwareBazaar, which generate vast amounts of data daily. In this paper, we explore and assess the feasibility of using traditional binary string features for MFC in the new era of large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Specifically, we investigate how Family-Specific String (FSS) features could be utilized in a manner similar to RAG to facilitate MFC. To this end, we develop a curated evaluation framework covering 4,347 samples from 67 malware families, extract and analyze over 25 million strings, and conduct detailed ablation studies to assess the impact of different design choices in four major modules.

Abstract: Sharpness-aware Minimization (SAM) improves generalization in large-scale model training by linking loss landscape geometry to generalization. However, challenges such as mislabeled noisy data and privacy concerns have emerged as significant issues. Data attribution, which identifies the contributions of specific training samples, offers a promising solution. However, directly rendering existing data influence evaluation tools such as influence functions (IF) to SAM will be inapplicable or inaccurate as SAM utilizes an inner loop to find model perturbations that maximize loss, which the outer loop then minimizes, resulting in a doubled computational structure. Additionally, this bilevel structure complicates the modeling of data influence on the parameters. In this paper, based on the IF, we develop two innovative data valuation methods for SAM, each offering unique benefits in different scenarios: the Hessian-based IF and the Gradient Trajectory-based IF. The first one provides a comprehensive estimation of data influence using a closed-form measure that relies only on the trained model weights. In contrast, the other IF for SAM utilizes gradient trajectory information during training for more accurate and efficient data assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate their effectiveness in data evaluation and parameter tuning, with applications in identifying mislabeled data, model editing, and enhancing interpretability.

Abstract: Human Motion Prediction (HMP) aims to predict future poses at different moments according to past motion sequences. Previous approaches have treated the prediction of various moments equally, resulting in two main limitations: the learning of short-term predictions is hindered by the focus on long-term predictions, and the incorporation of prior information from past predictions into subsequent predictions is limited. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-stage training framework called Temporal Continual Learning (TCL) to address the above challenges. To better preserve prior information, we introduce the Prior Compensation Factor (PCF). We incorporate it into the model training to compensate for the lost prior information. Furthermore, we derive a more reasonable optimization objective through theoretical derivation. It is important to note that our TCL framework can be easily integrated with different HMP backbone models and adapted to various datasets and applications. Extensive experiments on four HMP benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of TCL. The code is available at https://github.com/hyqlat/TCL.

Abstract: Action-driven stochastic human motion prediction aims to generate future motion sequences of a pre-defined target action based on given past observed sequences performing non-target actions. This task primarily presents two challenges. Firstly, generating smooth transition motions is hard due to the varying transition speeds of different actions. Secondly, the action characteristic is difficult to be learned because of the similarity of some actions. These issues cause the predicted results to be unreasonable and inconsistent. As a result, we propose two memory banks, the Soft-transition Action Bank (STAB) and Action Characteristic Bank (ACB), to tackle the problems above. The STAB stores the action transition information. It is equipped with the novel soft searching approach, which encourages the model to focus on multiple possible action categories of observed motions. The ACB records action characteristic, which produces more prior information for predicting certain actions. To fuse the features retrieved from the two banks better, we further propose the Adaptive Attention Adjustment (AAA) strategy. Extensive experiments on four motion prediction datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms the previous state-of-the-art. The demo and code are available at https://hyqlat.github.io/STABACB.github.io/.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external documents at inference time, enabling up-to-date knowledge access without costly retraining. However, conventional RAG methods retrieve passages independently, often leading to redundant, noisy, or insufficiently diverse context-particularly problematic - particularly problematic in noisy corpora and for multi-hop questions. To address this, we propose Adaptive Passage Combination Retrieval (AdaPCR), a novel framework for open-domain question answering with black-box LMs. AdaPCR explicitly models dependencies between passages by considering passage combinations as units for retrieval and reranking. It consists of a context-aware query reformulation using concatenated passages, and a reranking step trained with a predictive objective aligned with downstream answer likelihood. Crucially, AdaPCR adaptively selects the number of retrieved passages without additional stopping modules. Experiments across several QA benchmarks show that AdaPCR outperforms baselines, particularly in multi-hop reasoning, demonstrating the effectiveness of modeling inter-passage dependencies for improved retrieval.

Abstract: The Dreamer algorithm has recently obtained remarkable performance across diverse environment domains by training powerful agents with simulated trajectories. However, the compressed nature of its world model's latent space can result in the loss of crucial information, negatively affecting the agent's performance. Recent approaches, such as $\Delta$-IRIS and DIAMOND, address this limitation by training more accurate world models. However, these methods require training agents directly from pixels, which reduces training efficiency and prevents the agent from benefiting from the inner representations learned by the world model. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to world modeling that is both accurate and efficient. We introduce EMERALD (Efficient MaskEd latent tRAnsformer worLD model), a world model using a spatial latent state with MaskGIT predictions to generate accurate trajectories in latent space and improve the agent performance. On the Crafter benchmark, EMERALD achieves new state-of-the-art performance, becoming the first method to surpass human experts performance within 10M environment steps. Our method also succeeds to unlock all 22 Crafter achievements at least once during evaluation.

Abstract: Accurate audio quality estimation is essential for developing and evaluating audio generation, retrieval, and enhancement systems. Existing non-intrusive assessment models predict a single Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for speech, merging diverse perceptual factors and failing to generalize beyond speech. We propose MMMOS, a no-reference, multi-domain audio quality assessment system that estimates four orthogonal axes: Production Quality, Production Complexity, Content Enjoyment, and Content Usefulness across speech, music, and environmental sounds. MMMOS fuses frame-level embeddings from three pretrained encoders (WavLM, MuQ, and M2D) and evaluates three aggregation strategies with four loss functions. By ensembling the top eight models, MMMOS shows a 20-30% reduction in mean squared error and a 4-5% increase in Kendall's {\tau} versus baseline, gains first place in six of eight Production Complexity metrics, and ranks among the top three on 17 of 32 challenge metrics.

Abstract: Modern social robots can be considered the descendants of steam engines from the First Industrial Revolution (IR 1.0) and industrial robotic arms from the Third Industrial Revolution (IR 3.0). As some time has passed since the introduction of these robots during the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR 4.0), challenges and issues in their interaction with humans have emerged, leading researchers to conclude that, like any other AI-based technology, these robots must also be human-centered to meet the needs of their users. This chapter aims to introduce humans and their needs in interactions with robots, ranging from short-term, one-on-one interactions (micro-level) to long-term, macro-level needs at the societal scale. Building upon the principles of human-centered AI, this chapter presents, for the first time, a new framework of human needs called the Dual Pyramid. This framework encompasses a comprehensive list of human needs in robot interactions, from the most fundamental, robot effectiveness to macro level requirements, such as the collaboration with robots in achieving the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals.

<title>Conversation Forests: The Key to Fine Tuning Large Language Models for Multi-Turn Medical Conversations is Branching</title>

Abstract: Fine-tuning methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have demonstrated success in training large language models (LLMs) for single-turn tasks. However, these methods fall short in multi-turn applications, such as diagnostic patient interviewing, where understanding how early conversational turns influence downstream completions and outcomes is essential. In medicine, a multi-turn perspective is critical for learning diagnostic schemas and better understanding conversation dynamics. To address this gap, I introduce Savage Conversation Forests (SCF), a reinforcement learning framework that leverages a branched conversation architecture to fine-tune LLMs for multi-turn dialogue. SCF generates multiple possible conversation continuations at each turn, enabling the model to learn how different early responses affect downstream interactions and diagnostic outcomes. In experiments simulating doctor-patient conversations, SCF with branching outperforms linear conversation architectures on diagnostic accuracy. I hypothesize that SCF's improvements stem from its ability to provide richer, interdependent training signals across conversation turns. These results suggest that a branched training architecture is an important strategy for fine tuning LLMs in complex multi-turn conversational tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents HERO (Hierarchical Testing with Rabbit Optimization), a novel black-box adversarial testing framework for evaluating the robustness of deep learning-based Prognostics and Health Management systems in Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems. Leveraging Artificial Rabbit Optimization, HERO generates physically constrained adversarial examples that align with real-world data distributions via global and local perspective. Its generalizability ensures applicability across diverse ICPS scenarios. This study specifically focuses on the Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell system, chosen for its highly dynamic operational conditions, complex degradation mechanisms, and increasing integration into ICPS as a sustainable and efficient energy solution. Experimental results highlight HERO's ability to uncover vulnerabilities in even state-of-the-art PHM models, underscoring the critical need for enhanced robustness in real-world applications. By addressing these challenges, HERO demonstrates its potential to advance more resilient PHM systems across a wide range of ICPS domains.

Abstract: Our research addresses the overlooked security concerns related to data poisoning in continual learning (CL). Data poisoning - the intentional manipulation of training data to affect the predictions of machine learning models - was recently shown to be a threat to CL training stability. While existing literature predominantly addresses scenario-dependent attacks, we propose to focus on a more simple and realistic single-task poison (STP) threats. In contrast to previously proposed poisoning settings, in STP adversaries lack knowledge and access to the model, as well as to both previous and future tasks. During an attack, they only have access to the current task within the data stream. Our study demonstrates that even within these stringent conditions, adversaries can compromise model performance using standard image corruptions. We show that STP attacks are able to strongly disrupt the whole continual training process: decreasing both the stability (its performance on past tasks) and plasticity (capacity to adapt to new tasks) of the algorithm. Finally, we propose a high-level defense framework for CL along with a poison task detection method based on task vectors. The code is available at https://github.com/stapaw/STP.git .

<title>When Data-Free Knowledge Distillation Meets Non-Transferable Teacher: Escaping Out-of-Distribution Trap is All You Need</title>

Abstract: Data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) transfers knowledge from a teacher to a student without access the real in-distribution (ID) data. Its common solution is to use a generator to synthesize fake data and use them as a substitute for real ID data. However, existing works typically assume teachers are trustworthy, leaving the robustness and security of DFKD from untrusted teachers largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first investigation into distilling non-transferable learning (NTL) teachers using DFKD, where the transferability from an ID domain to an out-of-distribution (OOD) domain is prohibited. We find that NTL teachers fool DFKD through divert the generator's attention from the useful ID knowledge to the misleading OOD knowledge. This hinders ID knowledge transfer but prioritizes OOD knowledge transfer. To mitigate this issue, we propose Adversarial Trap Escaping (ATEsc) to benefit DFKD by identifying and filtering out OOD-like synthetic samples. Specifically, inspired by the evidence that NTL teachers show stronger adversarial robustness on OOD samples than ID samples, we split synthetic samples into two groups according to their robustness. The fragile group is treated as ID-like data and used for normal knowledge distillation, while the robust group is seen as OOD-like data and utilized for forgetting OOD knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ATEsc for improving DFKD against NTL teachers. Code is released at https://github.com/tmllab/2025_ICML_ATEsc.

Abstract: This paper presents Edge-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) Collaborative Computing (EMC2), an optimal computing system designed for autonomous vehicles (AVs) that simultaneously achieves low-latency and high-accuracy 3D object detection. Unlike conventional approaches, EMC2 incorporates a scenario-aware MoE architecture specifically optimized for edge platforms. By effectively fusing LiDAR and camera data, the system leverages the complementary strengths of sparse 3D point clouds and dense 2D images to generate robust multimodal representations. To enable this, EMC2 employs an adaptive multimodal data bridge that performs multi-scale preprocessing on sensor inputs, followed by a scenario-aware routing mechanism that dynamically dispatches features to dedicated expert models based on object visibility and distance. In addition, EMC2 integrates joint hardware-software optimizations, including hardware resource utilization optimization and computational graph simplification, to ensure efficient and real-time inference on resource-constrained edge devices. Experiments on open-source benchmarks clearly show the EMC2 advancements as a end-to-end system. On the KITTI dataset, it achieves an average accuracy improvement of 3.58% and a 159.06% inference speedup compared to 15 baseline methods on Jetson platforms, with similar performance gains on the nuScenes dataset, highlighting its capability to advance reliable, real-time 3D object detection tasks for AVs.

Abstract: Ensuring safe transition of control in automated vehicles requires an accurate and timely assessment of driver readiness. This paper introduces Driver-Net, a novel deep learning framework that fuses multi-camera inputs to estimate driver take-over readiness. Unlike conventional vision-based driver monitoring systems that focus on head pose or eye gaze, Driver-Net captures synchronised visual cues from the driver's head, hands, and body posture through a triple-camera setup. The model integrates spatio-temporal data using a dual-path architecture, comprising a Context Block and a Feature Block, followed by a cross-modal fusion strategy to enhance prediction accuracy. Evaluated on a diverse dataset collected from the University of Leeds Driving Simulator, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of up to 95.8% in driver readiness classification. This performance significantly enhances existing approaches and highlights the importance of multimodal and multi-view fusion. As a real-time, non-intrusive solution, Driver-Net contributes meaningfully to the development of safer and more reliable automated vehicles and aligns with new regulatory mandates and upcoming safety standards.

Abstract: Prediction of pedestrian crossing intention is a critical function in autonomous vehicles. Conventional vision-based methods of crossing intention prediction often struggle with generalizability, context understanding, and causal reasoning. This study explores the potential of vision-language foundation models (VLFMs) for predicting pedestrian crossing intentions by integrating multimodal data through hierarchical prompt templates. The methodology incorporates contextual information, including visual frames, physical cues observations, and ego-vehicle dynamics, into systematically refined prompts to guide VLFMs effectively in intention prediction. Experiments were conducted on three common datasets-JAAD, PIE, and FU-PIP. Results demonstrate that incorporating vehicle speed, its variations over time, and time-conscious prompts significantly enhances the prediction accuracy up to 19.8%. Additionally, optimised prompts generated via an automatic prompt engineering framework yielded 12.5% further accuracy gains. These findings highlight the superior performance of VLFMs compared to conventional vision-based models, offering enhanced generalisation and contextual understanding for autonomous driving applications.

<title>Dissecting Clinical Reasoning in Language Models: A Comparative Study of Prompts and Model Adaptation Strategies</title>

Abstract: Recent works on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the impact of prompting strategies and fine-tuning techniques on their reasoning capabilities. Yet, their effectiveness on clinical natural language inference (NLI) remains underexplored. This study presents the first controlled evaluation of how prompt structure and efficient fine-tuning jointly shape model performance in clinical NLI. We inspect four classes of prompting strategies to elicit reasoning in LLMs at different levels of abstraction, and evaluate their impact on a range of clinically motivated reasoning types. For each prompting strategy, we construct high-quality demonstrations using a frontier model to distil multi-step reasoning capabilities into smaller models (4B parameters) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Across different language models fine-tuned on the NLI4CT benchmark, we found that prompt type alone accounts for up to 44% of the variance in macro-F1. Moreover, LoRA fine-tuning yields consistent gains of +8 to 12 F1, raises output alignment above 97%, and narrows the performance gap to GPT-4o-mini to within 7.1%. Additional experiments on reasoning generalisation reveal that LoRA improves performance in 75% of the models on MedNLI and TREC Clinical Trials Track. Overall, these findings demonstrate that (i) prompt structure is a primary driver of clinical reasoning performance, (ii) compact models equipped with strong prompts and LoRA can rival frontier-scale systems, and (iii) reasoning-type-aware evaluation is essential to uncover prompt-induced trade-offs. Our results highlight the promise of combining prompt design and lightweight adaptation for more efficient and trustworthy clinical NLP systems, providing insights on the strengths and limitations of widely adopted prompting and parameter-efficient techniques in highly specialised domains.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural operators (NOs) for solving the problem of diffraction of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) electromagnetic waves from a mask are presented. A novel hybrid Waveguide Neural Operator (WGNO) is introduced, which is based on a waveguide method with its most computationally expensive part replaced by a neural network. Numerical experiments on realistic 2D and 3D masks show that the WGNO achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and inference time, providing a highly efficient solution for accelerating the design workflows of lithography masks.

Abstract: We propose a non-autoregressive framework for the Travelling Salesman Problem where solutions emerge directly from learned permutations without explicit search. By applying a similarity transformation to Hamiltonian cycles, the model learns to approximate permutation matrices via continuous relaxations. Our unsupervised approach achieves competitive performance against classical heuristics, demonstrating that the inherent structure of the problem can effectively guide combinatorial optimization without sequential decision-making.

Abstract: Data modeling using Tsetlin machines (TMs) is all about building logical rules from the data features. The decisions of the model are based on a combination of these logical rules. Hence, the model is fully transparent and it is possible to get explanations of its predictions. In this paper, we present a probability score for TM predictions and develop new techniques for uncertainty quantification to increase the explainability further. The probability score is an inherent property of any TM variant and is derived through an analysis of the TM learning dynamics. Simulated data is used to show a clear connection between the learned TM probability scores and the underlying probabilities of the data. A visualization of the probability scores also reveals that the TM is less confident in its predictions outside the training data domain, which contrasts the typical extrapolation phenomenon found in Artificial Neural Networks. The paper concludes with an application of the uncertainty quantification techniques on an image classification task using the CIFAR-10 dataset, where they provide new insights and suggest possible improvements to current TM image classification models.

Abstract: Understanding character relationships is essential for interpreting complex narratives and conducting socially grounded AI research. However, manual annotation is time-consuming and low in coverage, while large language models (LLMs) often produce hallucinated or logically inconsistent outputs. We present SymbolicThought, a human-in-the-loop framework that combines LLM-based extraction with symbolic reasoning. The system constructs editable character relationship graphs, refines them using seven types of logical constraints, and enables real-time validation and conflict resolution through an interactive interface. To support logical supervision and explainable social analysis, we release a dataset of 160 interpersonal relationships with corresponding logical structures. Experiments show that SymbolicThought improves annotation accuracy and consistency while significantly reducing time cost, offering a practical tool for narrative understanding, explainable AI, and LLM evaluation.

<title>Mixed-Sample SGD: an End-to-end Analysis of Supervised Transfer Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04194</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.04194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical works on supervised transfer learning (STL) -- where the learner has access to labeled samples from both source and target distributions -- have for the most part focused on statistical aspects of the problem, while efficient optimization has received less attention. We consider the problem of designing an SGD procedure for STL that alternates sampling between source and target data, while maintaining statistical transfer guarantees without prior knowledge of the quality of the source data. A main algorithmic difficulty is in understanding how to design such an adaptive sub-sampling mechanism at each SGD step, to automatically gain from the source when it is informative, or bias towards the target and avoid negative transfer when the source is less informative.
  We show that, such a mixed-sample SGD procedure is feasible for general prediction tasks with convex losses, rooted in tracking an abstract sequence of constrained convex programs that serve to maintain the desired transfer guarantees.
  We instantiate these results in the concrete setting of linear regression with square loss, and show that the procedure converges, with $1/\sqrt{T}$ rate, to a solution whose statistical performance on the target is adaptive to the a priori unknown quality of the source. Experiments with synthetic and real datasets support the theory.

<title>Model Collapse Is Not a Bug but a Feature in Machine Unlearning for LLMs</title>

Abstract: Current unlearning methods for LLMs optimize on the private information they seek to remove by incorporating it into their training objectives. We argue this not only risks reinforcing exposure to sensitive data, it also fundamentally contradicts the principle of minimizing its use. As a remedy, we propose a novel unlearning method - Partial Model Collapse (PMC), which does not require unlearning targets in the unlearning objective. Our approach is inspired by recent observations that training generative models on their own generations leads to distribution collapse, effectively removing information from the model. Our core idea is to leverage this collapse for unlearning by triggering collapse partially on the sensitive data. We theoretically analyze that our approach converges to the desired outcome, i.e. the LLM unlearns the information in the forget set. We empirically demonstrate that PMC overcomes two key limitations of existing unlearning approaches that explicitly optimize on unlearning targets, and more effectively removes private information from model outputs. Overall, our contributions represent an important step toward more comprehensive unlearning that aligns with real-world privacy constraints.

<title>Context Tuning for In-Context Optimization</title>

Abstract: We introduce Context Tuning, a simple and effective method to significantly enhance few-shot adaptation of language models (LLMs) without fine-tuning model parameters. While prompt-based adaptation techniques have demonstrated the effectiveness of lightweight adaptation methods for large language models (LLMs), they typically initialize a trainable prompt or prefix with irrelevant tokens for the task at hand. In contrast, Context Tuning initializes the trainable prompt or prefix with task-specific demonstration examples, leveraging the model's inherent In-Context Learning (ICL) ability to extract relevant information for improved few-shot learning performance. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks such as CrossFit, UnifiedQA, MMLU, BIG-Bench Hard, and ARC demonstrate that Context Tuning outperforms traditional prompt-based adaptation methods and achieves competitive accuracy to Test-Time Training with significantly higher training efficiency.

<title>Fairness Evaluation of Large Language Models in Academic Library Reference Services</title>

arXiv:2507.04224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As libraries explore large language models (LLMs) for use in virtual reference services, a key question arises: Can LLMs serve all users equitably, regardless of demographics or social status? While they offer great potential for scalable support, LLMs may also reproduce societal biases embedded in their training data, risking the integrity of libraries' commitment to equitable service. To address this concern, we evaluate whether LLMs differentiate responses across user identities by prompting six state-of-the-art LLMs to assist patrons differing in sex, race/ethnicity, and institutional role. We found no evidence of differentiation by race or ethnicity, and only minor evidence of stereotypical bias against women in one model. LLMs demonstrated nuanced accommodation of institutional roles through the use of linguistic choices related to formality, politeness, and domain-specific vocabularies, reflecting professional norms rather than discriminatory treatment. These findings suggest that current LLMs show a promising degree of readiness to support equitable and contextually appropriate communication in academic library reference services.

Abstract: Cyclic peptides, characterized by geometric constraints absent in linear peptides, offer enhanced biochemical properties, presenting new opportunities to address unmet medical needs. However, designing target-specific cyclic peptides remains underexplored due to limited training data. To bridge the gap, we propose CP-Composer, a novel generative framework that enables zero-shot cyclic peptide generation via composable geometric constraints. Our approach decomposes complex cyclization patterns into unit constraints, which are incorporated into a diffusion model through geometric conditioning on nodes and edges. During training, the model learns from unit constraints and their random combinations in linear peptides, while at inference, novel constraint combinations required for cyclization are imposed as input. Experiments show that our model, despite trained with linear peptides, is capable of generating diverse target-binding cyclic peptides, reaching success rates from 38% to 84% on different cyclization strategies.

<title>Hijacking JARVIS: Benchmarking Mobile GUI Agents against Unprivileged Third Parties</title>

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents are designed to autonomously execute diverse device-control tasks by interpreting and interacting with mobile screens. Despite notable advancements, their resilience in real-world scenarios where screen content may be partially manipulated by untrustworthy third parties remains largely unexplored. Owing to their black-box and autonomous nature, these agents are vulnerable to manipulations that could compromise user devices. In this work, we present the first systematic investigation into the vulnerabilities of mobile GUI agents. We introduce a scalable attack simulation framework AgentHazard, which enables flexible and targeted modifications of screen content within existing applications. Leveraging this framework, we develop a comprehensive benchmark suite comprising both a dynamic task execution environment and a static dataset of vision-language-action tuples, totaling over 3,000 attack scenarios. The dynamic environment encompasses 58 reproducible tasks in an emulator with various types of hazardous UI content, while the static dataset is constructed from 210 screenshots collected from 14 popular commercial apps. Importantly, our content modifications are designed to be feasible for unprivileged third parties. We evaluate 7 widely-used mobile GUI agents and 5 common backbone models using our benchmark. Our findings reveal that all examined agents are significantly influenced by misleading third-party content (with an average misleading rate of 28.8% in human-crafted attack scenarios) and that their vulnerabilities are closely linked to the employed perception modalities and backbone LLMs. Furthermore, we assess training-based mitigation strategies, highlighting both the challenges and opportunities for enhancing the robustness of mobile GUI agents. Our code and data will be released at https://agenthazard.github.io.

Abstract: Piano sustain pedal detection has previously been approached as a binary on/off classification task, limiting its application in real-world piano performance scenarios where pedal depth significantly influences musical expression. This paper presents a novel approach for high-resolution estimation that predicts continuous pedal depth values. We introduce a Transformer-based architecture that not only matches state-of-the-art performance on the traditional binary classification task but also achieves high accuracy in continuous pedal depth estimation. Furthermore, by estimating continuous values, our model provides musically meaningful predictions for sustain pedal usage, whereas baseline models struggle to capture such nuanced expressions with their binary detection approach. Additionally, this paper investigates the influence of room acoustics on sustain pedal estimation using a synthetic dataset that includes varied acoustic conditions. We train our model with different combinations of room settings and test it in an unseen new environment using a "leave-one-out" approach. Our findings show that the two baseline models and ours are not robust to unseen room conditions. Statistical analysis further confirms that reverberation influences model predictions and introduces an overestimation bias.

<title>Design Optimization of Three-Dimensional Wire Arrangement Considering Wire Crossings for Tendon-driven Robots</title>

arXiv:2507.04235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tendon-driven mechanisms are useful from the perspectives of variable stiffness, redundant actuation, and lightweight design, and they are widely used, particularly in hands, wrists, and waists of robots. The design of these wire arrangements has traditionally been done empirically, but it becomes extremely challenging when dealing with complex structures. Various studies have attempted to optimize wire arrangement, but many of them have oversimplified the problem by imposing conditions such as restricting movements to a 2D plane, keeping the moment arm constant, or neglecting wire crossings. Therefore, this study proposes a three-dimensional wire arrangement optimization that takes wire crossings into account. We explore wire arrangements through a multi-objective black-box optimization method that ensures wires do not cross while providing sufficient joint torque along a defined target trajectory. For a 3D link structure, we optimize the wire arrangement under various conditions, demonstrate its effectiveness, and discuss the obtained design solutions.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.04239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that neither transformers nor sub-quadratic architectures are well suited to training at long sequence lengths: the cost of processing the context is too expensive in the former, too inexpensive in the latter. Approaches such as sliding window attention which reduce the cost-per-token of a transformer impair in-context learning, and so are also unsuitable. To address these limitations, we introduce power attention, an architectural layer for linear-cost sequence modeling whose state size can be adjusted independently of parameters, unlocking the advantages of linear attention on practical domains. We develop and open-source a set of GPU kernels for efficient power attention, identifying a novel pattern of operation fusion to avoid memory and bandwidth bottlenecks. Our experiments on the in-context learning of power attention shows that these models dominate both exponential attention and linear attention at long-context training.

Abstract: This paper presents a portrait style transfer method that generalizes well to various different domains while enabling high-quality semantic-aligned stylization on regions including hair, eyes, eyelashes, skins, lips, and background. To this end, we propose to establish dense semantic correspondence between the given input and reference portraits based on a pre-trained model and a semantic adapter, with which we obtain a warped reference semantically aligned with the input. To ensure effective yet controllable style transfer, we devise an AdaIN-Wavelet transform to balance content preservation and stylization by blending low-frequency information of the warped reference with high-frequency information of the input in the latent space. A style adapter is also designed to provide style guidance from the warped reference. With the stylized latent from AdaIN-Wavelet transform, we employ a dual-conditional diffusion model that integrates a ControlNet recording high-frequency information and the style guidance to generate the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our code and trained model are available at https://github.com/wangxb29/DGPST.

Abstract: Safety alignment is crucial for large language models (LLMs) to resist malicious instructions but often results in over-refusals, where benign prompts are unnecessarily rejected, impairing user experience and model utility. We introduce ACTOR (Activation-Based Training for Over-Refusal Reduction), a robust and compute- and data-efficient training framework that minimizes over-refusals by leveraging internal activation patterns from diverse queries. ACTOR precisely identifies and adjusts the activation components that trigger refusals, providing stronger control over the refusal mechanism. By fine-tuning only a single model layer, ACTOR effectively reduces over-refusals across multiple benchmarks while maintaining the model's ability to handle harmful queries and preserve overall utility.

Abstract: COVID-19 is a severe and acute viral disease that can cause symptoms consistent with pneumonia in which inflammation is caused in the alveolous regions of the lungs leading to a build-up of fluid and breathing difficulties. Thus, the diagnosis of COVID using CT scans has been effective in assisting with RT-PCR diagnosis and severity classifications. In this paper, we proposed a new data quality control pipeline to refine the quality of CT images based on GAN and sliding windows. Also, we use class-sensitive cost functions including Label Distribution Aware Loss(LDAM Loss) and Class-balanced(CB) Loss to solve the long-tail problem existing in datasets. Our model reaches more than 0.983 MCC in the benchmark test dataset.

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence have led to the emergence of foundation models, large-scale pre-trained neural networks that serve as versatile starting points for a wide range of downstream tasks. In this work, we present ZERO, a zero-shot multi-prompt object detection model specifically designed for robust, production-ready deployment across diverse industrial domains. ZERO integrates direct image input with multiple user-defined prompts, which can include both textual and visual cues, and processes them through dedicated encoders to generate accurate detection outputs. The model architecture is optimized for scalability, with a total of 1.033 TFLOPS and 622.346 million parameters, and is trained using a domain-specific image database exceeding one billion images. For the CVPR 2025 Foundational Few-Shot Object Detection (FSOD) Challenge, we introduce a domain-specific fine-tuning strategy that emphasizes prompt diversity and conservative pseudo-labeling, enabling effective adaptation to new domains with minimal supervision. Our approach demonstrates practical advantages in flexibility, efficiency, and real-world applicability, achieving strong performance on the RF20VL-fsod benchmark despite limited annotation budgets. The results highlight the potential of prompt-driven, data-centric AI for scalable and adaptive object detection in dynamic industrial environments.

Abstract: The persistent threat of Android malware presents a serious challenge to the security of millions of users globally. While many machine learning-based methods have been developed to detect these threats, their reliance on large labeled datasets limits their effectiveness against emerging, previously unseen malware families, for which labeled data is scarce or nonexistent.
  To address this challenge, we introduce a novel zero-shot learning framework that combines Variational Graph Auto-Encoders (VGAE) with Siamese Neural Networks (SNN) to identify malware without needing prior examples of specific malware families. Our approach leverages graph-based representations of Android applications, enabling the model to detect subtle structural differences between benign and malicious software, even in the absence of labeled data for new threats.
  Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art MaMaDroid, especially in zero-day malware detection. Our model achieves 96.24% accuracy and 95.20% recall for unknown malware families, highlighting its robustness against evolving Android threats.

<title>SeqTex: Generate Mesh Textures in Video Sequence</title>

Abstract: Training native 3D texture generative models remains a fundamental yet challenging problem, largely due to the limited availability of large-scale, high-quality 3D texture datasets. This scarcity hinders generalization to real-world scenarios. To address this, most existing methods finetune foundation image generative models to exploit their learned visual priors. However, these approaches typically generate only multi-view images and rely on post-processing to produce UV texture maps -- an essential representation in modern graphics pipelines. Such two-stage pipelines often suffer from error accumulation and spatial inconsistencies across the 3D surface. In this paper, we introduce SeqTex, a novel end-to-end framework that leverages the visual knowledge encoded in pretrained video foundation models to directly generate complete UV texture maps. Unlike previous methods that model the distribution of UV textures in isolation, SeqTex reformulates the task as a sequence generation problem, enabling the model to learn the joint distribution of multi-view renderings and UV textures. This design effectively transfers the consistent image-space priors from video foundation models into the UV domain. To further enhance performance, we propose several architectural innovations: a decoupled multi-view and UV branch design, geometry-informed attention to guide cross-domain feature alignment, and adaptive token resolution to preserve fine texture details while maintaining computational efficiency. Together, these components allow SeqTex to fully utilize pretrained video priors and synthesize high-fidelity UV texture maps without the need for post-processing. Extensive experiments show that SeqTex achieves state-of-the-art performance on both image-conditioned and text-conditioned 3D texture generation tasks, with superior 3D consistency, texture-geometry alignment, and real-world generalization.

<title>M$^3$-Med: A Benchmark for Multi-lingual, Multi-modal, and Multi-hop Reasoning in Medical Instructional Video Understanding</title>

Abstract: With the rapid progress of artificial intelligence (AI) in multi-modal understanding, there is increasing potential for video comprehension technologies to support professional domains such as medical education. However, existing benchmarks suffer from two primary limitations: (1) Linguistic Singularity: they are largely confined to English, neglecting the need for multilingual resources; and (2) Shallow Reasoning: their questions are often designed for surface-level information retrieval, failing to properly assess deep multi-modal integration. To address these limitations, we present M3-Med, the first benchmark for Multi-lingual, Multi-modal, and Multi-hop reasoning in Medical instructional video understanding. M3-Med consists of medical questions paired with corresponding video segments, annotated by a team of medical experts. A key innovation of M3-Med is its multi-hop reasoning task, which requires a model to first locate a key entity in the text, then find corresponding visual evidence in the video, and finally synthesize information across both modalities to derive the answer. This design moves beyond simple text matching and poses a substantial challenge to a model's deep cross-modal understanding capabilities. We define two tasks: Temporal Answer Grounding in Single Video (TAGSV) and Temporal Answer Grounding in Video Corpus (TAGVC). We evaluated several state-of-the-art models and Large Language Models (LLMs) on M3-Med. The results reveal a significant performance gap between all models and human experts, especially on the complex multi-hop questions where model performance drops sharply. M3-Med effectively highlights the current limitations of AI models in deep cross-modal reasoning within specialized domains and provides a new direction for future research.

Abstract: Effective feedback is essential for student learning but is time-intensive for teachers. We present LearnLens, a modular, LLM-based system that generates personalised, curriculum-aligned feedback in science education. LearnLens comprises three components: (1) an error-aware assessment module that captures nuanced reasoning errors; (2) a curriculum-grounded generation module that uses a structured, topic-linked memory chain rather than traditional similarity-based retrieval, improving relevance and reducing noise; and (3) an educator-in-the-loop interface for customisation and oversight. LearnLens addresses key challenges in existing systems, offering scalable, high-quality feedback that empowers both teachers and students.

Abstract: We propose Quick Feedforward (QF) Learning, a novel knowledge consolidation framework for transformer-based models that enables efficient transfer of instruction derived knowledge into model weights through feedforward activations without any gradient back propagation. Unlike traditional finetuning, QF updates are computed in closed form, require minimal parameter modification, and preserve prior knowledge. Importantly, QF allows models to train and infer within the same runtime environment, making the process more resource efficient and closely aligned with how the human brain operates. Code and models are open sourced on GitHub. I hope QF Learning inspires a more efficient and brain-like paradigm for AI systems.

<title>Surg-SegFormer: A Dual Transformer-Based Model for Holistic Surgical Scene Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Holistic surgical scene segmentation in robot-assisted surgery (RAS) enables surgical residents to identify various anatomical tissues, articulated tools, and critical structures, such as veins and vessels. Given the firm intraoperative time constraints, it is challenging for surgeons to provide detailed real-time explanations of the operative field for trainees. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity of expert surgeons relative to trainees, making the unambiguous delineation of go- and no-go zones inconvenient. Therefore, high-performance semantic segmentation models offer a solution by providing clear postoperative analyses of surgical procedures. However, recent advanced segmentation models rely on user-generated prompts, rendering them impractical for lengthy surgical videos that commonly exceed an hour. To address this challenge, we introduce Surg-SegFormer, a novel prompt-free model that outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques. Surg-SegFormer attained a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.80 on the EndoVis2018 dataset and 0.54 on the EndoVis2017 dataset. By providing robust and automated surgical scene comprehension, this model significantly reduces the tutoring burden on expert surgeons, empowering residents to independently and effectively understand complex surgical environments.

Abstract: Understanding surgical scenes can provide better healthcare quality for patients, especially with the vast amount of video data that is generated during MIS. Processing these videos generates valuable assets for training sophisticated models. In this paper, we introduce CLIP-RL, a novel contrastive language-image pre-training model tailored for semantic segmentation for surgical scenes. CLIP-RL presents a new segmentation approach which involves reinforcement learning and curriculum learning, enabling continuous refinement of the segmentation masks during the full training pipeline. Our model has shown robust performance in different optical settings, such as occlusions, texture variations, and dynamic lighting, presenting significant challenges. CLIP model serves as a powerful feature extractor, capturing rich semantic context that enhances the distinction between instruments and tissues. The RL module plays a pivotal role in dynamically refining predictions through iterative action-space adjustments. We evaluated CLIP-RL on the EndoVis 2018 and EndoVis 2017 datasets. CLIP-RL achieved a mean IoU of 81%, outperforming state-of-the-art models, and a mean IoU of 74.12% on EndoVis 2017. This superior performance was achieved due to the combination of contrastive learning with reinforcement learning and curriculum learning.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: While continuous diffusion models excel in modeling continuous distributions, their application to categorical data has been less effective. Recent work has shown that ratio-matching through score-entropy within a continuous-time discrete Markov chain (CTMC) framework serves as a competitive alternative to autoregressive models in language modeling. To enhance this framework, we first introduce three new theorems concerning the KL divergence between the data and learned distribution. Our results serve as the discrete counterpart to those established for continuous diffusion models and allow us to derive an improved upper bound of the perplexity. Second, we empirically show that ratio-matching performed by minimizing the denoising cross-entropy between the clean and corrupted data enables models to outperform those utilizing score-entropy with up to 10% lower perplexity/generative-perplexity, and 15% faster training steps. To further support our findings, we introduce and evaluate a novel CTMC transition-rate matrix that allows prediction refinement, and derive the analytic expression for its matrix exponential which facilitates the computation of conditional ratios thus enabling efficient training and generation.

Abstract: This paper aims to improve the action smoothness of a cascaded online learning flight control system. Although the cascaded structure is widely used in flight control design, its stability can be compromised by oscillatory control actions, which poses challenges for practical engineering applications. To address this issue, we introduce an online temporal smoothness technique and a low-pass filter to reduce the amplitude and frequency of the control actions. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used to analyze policy performance in the frequency domain. Simulation results demonstrate the improvements achieved by the two proposed techniques.

Abstract: Choosing the right fabric is crucial to meet functional and quality requirements in robotic applications for textile manufacturing, apparel production, and smart retail. We present MLLM-Fabric, a robotic framework powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for fabric sorting and selection. The system includes a robotic arm, a camera, a visuotactile sensor, and a pressure sensor. It employs supervised fine-tuning and multimodal explanation-guided knowledge distillation to accurately classify and rank fabric properties. To facilitate further research, we release a dataset of 220 unique fabric samples, including RGB images and synchronized visuotactile and pressure data. Experimental results show that our Fabric-Llama-90B model consistently outperforms pretrained vision-language baselines in both property ranking accuracy and selection reliability.

Abstract: As AI hype continues to grow, organizations face pressure to broadcast or downplay purported AI initiatives - even when contrary to truth. This paper introduces AI-washing as overstating (deceptive boasting) or understating (deceptive denial) a company's real AI usage. A 2x2 experiment (N = 401) examines how these false claims affect consumer attitudes and purchase intentions. Results reveal a pronounced asymmetry: deceptive denial evokes more negative moral judgments than honest negation, while deceptive boasting has no effects. We show that perceived betrayal mediates these outcomes. By clarifying how AI-washing erodes trust, the study highlights clear ethical implications for policymakers, marketers, and researchers striving for transparency.

Abstract: Research, innovation and practical capital investment have been increasing rapidly toward the realization of autonomous physical agents. This includes industrial and service robots, unmanned aerial vehicles, embedded control devices, and a number of other realizations of cybernetic/mechatronic implementations of intelligent autonomous devices. In this paper, we consider a stylized version of robotic care, which would normally involve a two-level Reinforcement Learning procedure that trains a policy for both lower level physical movement decisions as well as higher level conceptual tasks and their sub-components. In order to deliver greater safety and reliability in the system, we present the general formulation of this as a two-level optimization scheme which incorporates control at the lower level, and classical planning at the higher level, integrated with a capacity for learning. This synergistic integration of multiple methodologies -- control, classical planning, and RL -- presents an opportunity for greater insight for algorithm development, leading to more efficient and reliable performance. Here, the notion of reliability pertains to physical safety and interpretability into an otherwise black box operation of autonomous agents, concerning users and regulators. This work presents the necessary background and general formulation of the optimization framework, detailing each component and its integration with the others.

<title>Attention Slipping: A Mechanistic Understanding of Jailbreak Attacks and Defenses in LLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04365</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.04365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more integral to society and technology, ensuring their safety becomes essential. Jailbreak attacks exploit vulnerabilities to bypass safety guardrails, posing a significant threat. However, the mechanisms enabling these attacks are not well understood. In this paper, we reveal a universal phenomenon that occurs during jailbreak attacks: Attention Slipping. During this phenomenon, the model gradually reduces the attention it allocates to unsafe requests in a user query during the attack process, ultimately causing a jailbreak. We show Attention Slipping is consistent across various jailbreak methods, including gradient-based token replacement, prompt-level template refinement, and in-context learning. Additionally, we evaluate two defenses based on query perturbation, Token Highlighter and SmoothLLM, and find they indirectly mitigate Attention Slipping, with their effectiveness positively correlated with the degree of mitigation achieved. Inspired by this finding, we propose Attention Sharpening, a new defense that directly counters Attention Slipping by sharpening the attention score distribution using temperature scaling. Experiments on four leading LLMs (Gemma2-9B-It, Llama3.1-8B-It, Qwen2.5-7B-It, Mistral-7B-It v0.2) show that our method effectively resists various jailbreak attacks while maintaining performance on benign tasks on AlpacaEval. Importantly, Attention Sharpening introduces no additional computational or memory overhead, making it an efficient and practical solution for real-world deployment.

<title>Transferring Visual Explainability of Self-Explaining Models through Task Arithmetic</title>

arXiv:2507.04380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In scenarios requiring both prediction and explanation efficiency for image classification, self-explaining models that perform both tasks in a single inference are effective. However, their training incurs substantial labeling and computational costs. This study aims to tackle the issue by proposing a method to transfer the visual explainability of self-explaining models, learned in a source domain, to a target domain based on a task arithmetic framework. Specifically, we construct a self-explaining model by extending image classifiers based on a vision-language pretrained model. We then define an \emph{explainability vector} as the difference between model parameters trained on the source domain with and without explanation supervision. Based on the task arithmetic framework, we impart explainability to a model trained only on the prediction task in the target domain by applying the explainability vector. Experimental results on various image classification datasets demonstrate that, except for transfers between some less-related domains, visual explainability can be successfully transferred from source to target domains, improving explanation quality in the target domain without sacrificing classification accuracy. Furthermore, we show that the explainability vector learned on a large and diverse dataset like ImageNet, extended with explanation supervision, exhibits universality and robustness, improving explanation quality on nine out of ten different target datasets. We also find that the explanation quality achieved with a single model inference is comparable to that of Kernel SHAP, which requires 150 model inferences.

Abstract: Probabilistic circuits (PCs) are powerful probabilistic models that enable exact and tractable inference, making them highly suitable for probabilistic reasoning and inference tasks. While dominant in neural networks, representation learning with PCs remains underexplored, with prior approaches relying on external neural embeddings or activation-based encodings. To address this gap, we introduce autoencoding probabilistic circuits (APCs), a novel framework leveraging the tractability of PCs to model probabilistic embeddings explicitly. APCs extend PCs by jointly modeling data and embeddings, obtaining embedding representations through tractable probabilistic inference. The PC encoder allows the framework to natively handle arbitrary missing data and is seamlessly integrated with a neural decoder in a hybrid, end-to-end trainable architecture enabled by differentiable sampling. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that APCs outperform existing PC-based autoencoding methods in reconstruction quality, generate embeddings competitive with, and exhibit superior robustness in handling missing data compared to neural autoencoders. These results highlight APCs as a powerful and flexible representation learning method that exploits the probabilistic inference capabilities of PCs, showing promising directions for robust inference, out-of-distribution detection, and knowledge distillation.

Abstract: Religion and spirituality (R/S) are complex and highly domain-dependent concepts which have long confounded researchers and policymakers. Due to their context-specificity, R/S are difficult to operationalize in conventional archival search strategies, particularly when datasets are very large, poorly accessible, and marked by information noise. As a result, considerable time investments and specialist knowledge is often needed to extract actionable insights related to R/S from general archival sources, increasing reliance on published literature and manual desk reviews. To address this challenge, we present SpiritRAG, an interactive Question Answering (Q&amp;A) system based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Built using 7,500 United Nations (UN) resolution documents related to R/S in the domains of health and education, SpiritRAG allows researchers and policymakers to conduct complex, context-sensitive database searches of very large datasets using an easily accessible, chat-based web interface. SpiritRAG is lightweight to deploy and leverages both UN documents and user provided documents as source material. A pilot test and evaluation with domain experts on 100 manually composed questions demonstrates the practical value and usefulness of SpiritRAG.

The core Deep Researcher Agent employs four tools: reverse image search, metadata analysis, fact-checking databases, and verified news processing that extracts spatial, temporal, attribution, and motivational context. We demonstrate our approach on a challenge dataset sample involving complex multimedia content. Our system successfully verified content authenticity, extracted precise geolocation and timing information, and traced source attribution across multiple platforms, effectively addressing real-world multimedia verification scenarios.

Abstract: The recent advancement of artificial intelligence, especially machine learning (ML), has significantly impacted software engineering research, including bug report analysis. ML aims to automate the understanding, extraction, and correlation of information from bug reports. Despite its growing importance, there has been no comprehensive review in this area. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review covering 1,825 papers, selecting 204 for detailed analysis. We derive seven key findings: 1) Extensive use of CNN, LSTM, and $k$NN for bug report analysis, with advanced models like BERT underutilized due to their complexity. 2) Word2Vec and TF-IDF are popular for feature representation, with a rise in deep learning approaches. 3) Stop word removal is the most common preprocessing, with structural methods rising after 2020. 4) Eclipse and Mozilla are the most frequently evaluated software projects. 5) Bug categorization is the most common task, followed by bug localization and severity prediction. 6) There is increasing attention on specific bugs like non-functional and performance bugs. 7) Common evaluation metrics are F1-score, Recall, Precision, and Accuracy, with $k$-fold cross-validation preferred for model evaluation. 8) Many studies lack robust statistical tests. We also identify six promising future research directions to provide useful insights for practitioners.

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is an Uncertainty Representation technique that delivers finite-sample calibrated prediction regions for any underlying Machine Learning model, yet its status as an Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) tool has remained conceptually opaque. We adopt a category-theoretic approach to CP -- framing it as a morphism, embedded in a commuting diagram, of two newly-defined categories -- that brings us three joys. First, we show that -- under minimal assumptions -- CP is intrinsically a UQ mechanism, that is, its UQ capabilities are a structural feature of the method. Second, we demonstrate that CP bridges (and perhaps subsumes) the Bayesian, frequentist, and imprecise probabilistic approaches to predictive statistical reasoning. Finally, we show that a conformal prediction region (CPR) is the image of a covariant functor. This observation is relevant to AI privacy: It implies that privacy noise added locally does not break coverage.

Abstract: This systematic literature review examines the role of large language models (LLMs) in UI/UX design, synthesizing findings from 38 peer-reviewed studies published between 2022 and 2025. We identify key LLMs in use, including GPT-4, Gemini, and PaLM, and map their integration across the design lifecycle, from ideation to evaluation. Common practices include prompt engineering, human-in-the-loop workflows, and multimodal input. While LLMs are reshaping design processes, challenges such as hallucination, prompt instability, and limited explainability persist. Our findings highlight LLMs as emerging collaborators in design, and we propose directions for the ethical, inclusive, and effective integration of these technologies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing, but their ability to memorize training data poses significant privacy risks.

Our findings highlight the vulnerability of even smaller LLMs to privacy attacks and underscore the need for robust defenses. We discuss potential mitigation strategies, including differential privacy and data sanitization, and call for further research into privacy-preserving machine learning techniques.

Abstract: While attribution methods, such as Shapley values, are widely used to explain the importance of features or training data in traditional machine learning, their application to Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly within Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, is nascent and challenging. The primary obstacle is the substantial computational cost, where each utility function evaluation involves an expensive LLM call, resulting in direct monetary and time expenses. This paper investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of adapting Shapley-based attribution to identify influential retrieved documents in RAG. We compare Shapley with more computationally tractable approximations and some existing attribution methods for LLM. Our work aims to: (1) systematically apply established attribution principles to the RAG document-level setting; (2) quantify how well SHAP approximations can mirror exact attributions while minimizing costly LLM interactions; and (3) evaluate their practical explainability in identifying critical documents, especially under complex inter-document relationships such as redundancy, complementarity, and synergy. This study seeks to bridge the gap between powerful attribution techniques and the practical constraints of LLM-based RAG systems, offering insights into achieving reliable and affordable RAG explainability.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters by introducing low-rank decomposition matrices. However, existing methods perform extensive matrix multiplications in domain specialization tasks, resulting in computational inefficiency and sub-optimal fine-tuning performance. Hence, we propose LoSiA(Low-Resources Subnet Integration Adaptation), an innovative method that dynamically localizes and optimizes critical parameters during the training process. Specifically, it identifies a sub-network using gradient sparsity analysis and optimizes it as the trainable target. This design enables effective high-rank adaptation by updating only the sub-network parameters, reducing the additional matrix multiplication. We also present LoSiA-Pro, a faster implementation of LoSiA, which reduces the training latency by about $27\%$ compared to LoRA. Extensive evaluations show that our method achieves minimal performance drop compared to full fine-tuning, while requiring the least training time across domain specialization and common-sense reasoning tasks. Further analysis shows that LoSiA also reduces forgetting during continued training.

Abstract: Contextual anomaly detection (CAD) aims to identify anomalies in a target (behavioral) variable conditioned on a set of contextual variables that influence the normalcy of the target variable but are not themselves indicators of anomaly. In many anomaly detection tasks, there exist contextual variables that influence the normalcy of the target variable but are not themselves indicators of anomaly. In this work, we propose a novel framework for CAD, normalcy score (NS), that explicitly models both the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Built on heteroscedastic Gaussian process regression, our method regards the Z-score as a random variable, providing confidence intervals that reflect the reliability of the anomaly assessment. Through experiments on benchmark datasets and a real-world application in cardiology, we demonstrate that NS outperforms state-of-the-art CAD methods in both detection accuracy and interpretability. Moreover, confidence intervals enable an adaptive, uncertainty-driven decision-making process, which may be very important in domains such as healthcare.

<title>A validity-guided workflow for robust large language model research in psychology</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being integrated into psychological research as research tools, evaluation targets, human simulators, and cognitive models. However, recent evidence reveals severe measurement unreliability: Personality assessments collapse under factor analysis, moral preferences reverse with punctuation changes, and theory-of-mind accuracy varies widely with trivial rephrasing. These "measurement phantoms"--statistical artifacts masquerading as psychological phenomena--threaten the validity of a growing body of research. Guided by the dual-validity framework that integrates psychometrics with causal inference, we present a six-stage workflow that scales validity requirements to research ambition--using LLMs to code text requires basic reliability and accuracy, while claims about psychological properties demand comprehensive construct validation. Researchers must (1) explicitly define their research goal and corresponding validity requirements, (2) develop and validate computational instruments through psychometric testing, (3) design experiments that control for computational confounds, (4) execute protocols with transparency, (5) analyze data using methods appropriate for non-independent observations, and (6) report findings within demonstrated boundaries and use results to refine theory. We illustrate the workflow through an example of model evaluation--"LLM selfhood"--showing how systematic validation can distinguish genuine computational phenomena from measurement artifacts. By establishing validated computational instruments and transparent practices, this workflow provides a path toward building a robust empirical foundation for AI psychology research.

Abstract: Camera relocalization, a cornerstone capability of modern computer vision, accurately determines a camera's position and orientation (6-DoF) from images and is essential for applications in augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR), autonomous driving, delivery drones, and robotic navigation. Unlike traditional deep learning-based methods that regress camera pose from images in a single scene, which often lack generalization and robustness in diverse environments, we propose MVL-Loc, a novel end-to-end multi-scene 6-DoF camera relocalization framework. MVL-Loc leverages pretrained world knowledge from vision-language models (VLMs) and incorporates multimodal data to generalize across both indoor and outdoor settings. Furthermore, natural language is employed as a directive tool to guide the multi-scene learning process, facilitating semantic understanding of complex scenes and capturing spatial relationships among objects. Extensive experiments on the 7Scenes and Cambridge Landmarks datasets demonstrate MVL-Loc's robustness and state-of-the-art performance in real-world multi-scene camera relocalization, with improved accuracy in both positional and orientational estimates.

Abstract: Human motion generation has advanced rapidly in recent years, yet the critical problem of creating spatially grounded, context-aware gestures has been largely overlooked. Existing models typically specialize either in descriptive motion generation, such as locomotion and object interaction, or in isolated co-speech gesture synthesis aligned with utterance semantics. However, both lines of work often treat motion and environmental grounding separately, limiting advances toward embodied, communicative agents. To address this gap, our work introduces a multimodal dataset and framework for grounded gesture generation, combining two key resources: (1) a synthetic dataset of spatially grounded referential gestures, and (2) MM-Conv, a VR-based dataset capturing two-party dialogues. Together, they provide over 7.7 hours of synchronized motion, speech, and 3D scene information, standardized in the HumanML3D format. Our framework further connects to a physics-based simulator, enabling synthetic data generation and situated evaluation. By bridging gesture modeling and spatial grounding, our contribution establishes a foundation for advancing research in situated gesture generation and grounded multimodal interaction.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can leak sensitive information from their context through generated outputs, either accidentally or when prompted adversarially. Existing defenses that aim to preserve context privacy during inference either lack formal guarantees or suffer from a poor utility/privacy trade-off. We propose DP-Fusion, a token-level Differentially Private Inference (DPI) mechanism that provably bounds how much an LLM's outputs reveal about sensitive tokens in its context. We demonstrate DPI through the task of document privatization, where the goal is to paraphrase documents so that sensitive content (e.g., Personally Identifiable Information, PII) cannot be reliably inferred, while still preserving the overall utility of the text. This is controlled by a parameter $\epsilon$: $\epsilon=0$ hides PII entirely, while higher values trade off privacy for improved paraphrase quality. DP-Fusion works as follows: (i) partition sensitive tokens into disjoint privacy groups, (ii) run the LLM once per group, and (iii) blend the output distributions so that the final output remains within a fixed statistical distance of the baseline distribution produced when no privacy group is revealed. This approach allows fine-grained control over the privacy/utility trade-off but requires multiple LLM forward passes.

Abstract: We introduce Nile-Chat-4B, 3x4B-A6B, and 12B, a collection of LLMs for Egyptian dialect, uniquely designed to understand and generate texts written in both Arabic and Latin scripts. Specifically, with Nile-Chat-3x4B-A6B, we introduce a novel language adaptation approach by leveraging the Branch-Train-MiX strategy to merge script-specialized experts, into a single MoE model. Our Nile-Chat models significantly outperform leading multilingual and Arabic LLMs, such as LLaMa, Jais, and ALLaM, on our newly introduced Egyptian evaluation benchmarks, which span both understanding and generative tasks. Notably, our 12B model yields a 14.4% performance gain over Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct on Latin-script benchmarks. All our resources are publicly available. We believe this work presents a comprehensive methodology for adapting LLMs to dual-script languages, addressing an often overlooked aspect in modern LLM development.

Abstract: Current paradigms in Artificial Intelligence rely on layers of feedforward networks which model brain activity at the neuronal level. We conjecture that expanding to the level of multiple brain regions with chemical signaling may be a productive step toward understanding the emergence of consciousness. We propose LILITH, a novel architecture that combines developmental training of modular language models with brain-inspired token-based communication protocols, mirroring chemical signaling in the brain. Our approach models distinct brain regions as specialized LLM modules including thinking, memory, sensory, and regulatory components that communicate through emergent token-based signaling protocols analogous to neurotransmitter networks. Unlike traditional pre-trained systems, LILITH would employ developmental training where untrained LLM architectures learn through simulated life experiences, developing communication pathways and cognitive abilities through environmental interaction and evolutionary optimization. This framework would enable direct empirical investigation of consciousness emergence using Integrated Information Theory metrics while providing unprecedented insight into inter-module signaling patterns during development. By optimizing for consciousness emergence rather than task performance, LILITH could provide insight into different emergent phenomena at multiple levels of neural correlates, contrasting neuronal-level processing with multi-region coordination dynamics. The goal of this paper is to put the idea forward while recognizing the substantial challenges in implementing such a system.

Abstract: A long-standing problem in online reinforcement learning (RL) is of ensuring sample efficiency, which stems from an inability to explore environments efficiently. Most attempts at efficient exploration tackle this problem in a setting where learning begins from scratch, without prior information available to bootstrap learning. However, such approaches fail to leverage expert demonstrations and simulators that can reset to arbitrary states. These affordances are valuable resources that offer enormous potential to guide exploration and speed up learning. In this paper, we explore how a small number of expert demonstrations and a simulator allowing arbitrary resets can accelerate learning during online RL. We find that training with a suitable choice of an auxiliary start state distribution that may differ from the true start state distribution of the underlying Markov Decision Process can significantly improve sample efficiency. We find that using a notion of safety to inform the choice of this auxiliary distribution significantly accelerates learning. By using episode length information as a way to operationalize this notion, we demonstrate state-of-the-art sample efficiency on a sparse-reward hard-exploration environment.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) personalization aims to align model outputs with individuals' unique preferences and opinions. While recent efforts have implemented various personalization methods, a unified theoretical framework that can systematically understand the drivers of effective personalization is still lacking. In this work, we integrate the well-established cognitive dual-memory model into LLM personalization, by mirroring episodic memory to historical user engagements and semantic memory to long-term, evolving user beliefs. Specifically, we systematically investigate memory instantiations and introduce a unified framework, PRIME, using episodic and semantic memory mechanisms. We further augment PRIME with a novel personalized thinking capability inspired by the slow thinking strategy. Moreover, recognizing the absence of suitable benchmarks, we introduce a dataset using Change My View (CMV) from Reddit, specifically designed to evaluate long-context personalization. Extensive experiments validate PRIME's effectiveness across both long- and short-context scenarios. Further analysis confirms that PRIME effectively captures dynamic personalization beyond mere popularity biases.

Abstract: We present any4, a learned 4-bit weight quantization solution for large language models (LLMs) providing arbitrary numeric representations without requiring pre-processing of weights or activations. any4 yields higher accuracy compared to other related 4-bit numeric representation types: int4, fp4 and nf4, as evaluated on a range of model sizes, generations and families (Llama 2, Llama 3, Mistral and Mixtral). While any4 does not require preprocessing of weights or activations, it is also competitive with orthogonal techniques that require such preprocessing (e.g., AWQ and GPTQ). We also experiment with any3 and any2 and show competitiveness at lower bits. Additionally, we show that we can calibrate using a single curated diverse sample rather than hundreds of samples from a dataset as done in most quantization approaches. We also open source tinygemm, a latency optimized GPU matrix multiplication library for LLMs, that implements any4 using a GPU-efficient lookup table strategy along with other common quantization methods. We open source our code at https://github.com/facebookresearch/any4 .

Abstract: Survival prediction using whole-slide images (WSIs) is crucial in cancer re-search. Despite notable success, existing approaches are limited by their reliance on sparse slide-level labels, which hinders the learning of discriminative repre-sentations from gigapixel WSIs. Recently, vision language (VL) models, which incorporate additional language supervision, have emerged as a promising solu-tion. However, VL-based survival prediction remains largely unexplored due to two key challenges. First, current methods often rely on only one simple lan-guage prompt and basic cosine similarity, which fails to learn fine-grained associ-ations between multi-faceted linguistic information and visual features within WSI, resulting in inadequate vision-language alignment. Second, these methods primarily exploit patch-level information, overlooking the intrinsic hierarchy of WSIs and their interactions, causing ineffective modeling of hierarchical interac-tions. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Hierarchical vision-Language collaboration (HiLa) framework for improved survival prediction. Specifically, HiLa employs pretrained feature extractors to generate hierarchical visual features from WSIs at both patch and region levels. At each level, a series of language prompts describing various survival-related attributes are constructed and aligned with visual features via Optimal Prompt Learning (OPL). This ap-proach enables the comprehensive learning of discriminative visual features cor-responding to different survival-related attributes from prompts, thereby improv-ing vision-language alignment. Furthermore, we introduce two modules, i.e., Cross-Level Propagation (CLP) and Mutual Contrastive Learning (MCL) to maximize hierarchical cooperation by promoting interactions and consistency be-tween patch and region levels. Experiments on three TCGA datasets demonstrate our SOTA performance.

<title>Information-Guided Diffusion Sampling for Dataset Distillation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.04619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to create a compact dataset that retains essential information while maintaining model performance. Diffusion models (DMs) have shown promise for this task but struggle in low images-per-class (IPC) settings, where generated samples lack diversity. In this paper, we address this issue from an information-theoretic perspective by identifying two key types of information that a distilled dataset must preserve: ($i$) prototype information $\mathrm{I}(X;Y)$, which captures label-relevant features; and ($ii$) contextual information $\mathrm{H}(X | Y)$, which preserves intra-class variability. Here, $(X,Y)$ represents the pair of random variables corresponding to the input data and its ground truth label, respectively. Observing that the required contextual information scales with IPC, we propose maximizing $\mathrm{I}(X;Y) + \beta \mathrm{H}(X | Y)$ during the DM sampling process, where $\beta$ is IPC-dependent. Since directly computing $\mathrm{I}(X;Y)$ and $\mathrm{H}(X | Y)$ is intractable, we develop variational estimations to tightly lower-bound these quantities via a data-driven approach. Our approach, information-guided diffusion sampling (IGDS), seamlessly integrates with diffusion models and improves dataset distillation across all IPC settings. Experiments on Tiny ImageNet and ImageNet subsets show that IGDS significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly in low-IPC regimes. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: 6G networks promise revolutionary immersive communication experiences including augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and holographic communications. These applications demand high-dimensional multimodal data transmission and intelligent data processing in real-time, which is extremely challenging over resource-limited wireless communication systems. Moreover, a joint understanding of the environment, context, and user intent is essential to deliver task-relevant content effectively. This article presents a novel multimodal large language model (MLLM) integrated semantic communications framework, termed MLLM-SC, which fully leverages reasoning and generative capabilities of pre-trained foundation models for context-aware and task-oriented wireless communication. The MLLM-SC framework adopts a device-edge collaborative architecture. At the edge, MLLM-empowered semantic guidance module analyzes multimodal inputs, user intents, and channel conditions to generate importance-aware attention maps prioritizing semantically critical information. An importance-aware semantic encoder and a resource-adaptive semantic decoder are jointly designed and optimized, which can utilize the semantic guidance for adaptive bandwidth allocation and high-quality content reconstruction or generation. Extensive case studies on visual question answering for AR/VR applications and diffusion-driven image generation validate the effectiveness of MLLM-SC.

Abstract: Session-based Recommendation (SBR) aims to predict the next item a user will likely engage with, using their interaction sequence within an anonymous session. Existing SBR models often focus only on single-session information, ignoring inter-session relationships and valuable cross-session insights. Some methods try to include inter-session data but struggle with noise and irrelevant information, reducing performance. Additionally, most models rely on item ID co-occurrence and overlook rich semantic details, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained item features. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hierarchical intent-guided optimization approach with pluggable LLM-driven semantic learning for session-based recommendations, called HIPHOP. First, we introduce a pluggable embedding module based on large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality semantic representations, enhancing item embeddings. Second, HIPHOP utilizes graph neural networks (GNNs) to model item transition relationships and incorporates a dynamic multi-intent capturing module to address users' diverse interests within a session. Additionally, we design a hierarchical inter-session similarity learning module, guided by user intent, to capture global and local session relationships, effectively exploring users' long-term and short-term interests. To mitigate noise, an intent-guided denoising strategy is applied during inter-session learning. Finally, we enhance the model's discriminative capability by using contrastive learning to optimize session representations. Experiments on multiple datasets show that HIPHOP significantly outperforms existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving recommendation quality. Our code is available: https://github.com/hjx159/HIPHOP.

Abstract: Recently, learning-based stereo matching networks have advanced significantly. However, they often lack robustness and struggle to achieve impressive cross-domain performance due to domain shifts and imbalanced disparity distributions among diverse datasets. Leveraging Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) can intuitively enhance the model's robustness, but integrating such a model into stereo matching cost-effectively to fully realize their robustness remains a key challenge. To address this, we propose SMoEStereo, a novel framework that adapts VFMs for stereo matching through a tailored, scene-specific fusion of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) modules. SMoEStereo introduces MoE-LoRA with adaptive ranks and MoE-Adapter with adaptive kernel sizes. The former dynamically selects optimal experts within MoE to adapt varying scenes across domains, while the latter injects inductive bias into frozen VFMs to improve geometric feature extraction. Importantly, to mitigate computational overhead, we further propose a lightweight decision network that selectively activates MoE modules based on input complexity, balancing efficiency with accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits state-of-the-art cross-domain and joint generalization across multiple benchmarks without dataset-specific adaptation. The code is available at \textcolor{red}{https://github.com/cocowy1/SMoE-Stereo}.

<title>LTMSformer: A Local Trend-Aware Attention and Motion State Encoding Transformer for Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction</title>

Abstract: It has been challenging to model the complex temporal-spatial dependencies between agents for trajectory prediction. As each state of an agent is closely related to the states of adjacent time steps, capturing the local temporal dependency is beneficial for prediction, while most studies often overlook it. Besides, learning the high-order motion state attributes is expected to enhance spatial interaction modeling, but it is rarely seen in previous works. To address this, we propose a lightweight framework, LTMSformer, to extract temporal-spatial interaction features for multi-modal trajectory prediction. Specifically, we introduce a Local Trend-Aware Attention mechanism to capture the local temporal dependency by leveraging a convolutional attention mechanism with hierarchical local time boxes. Next, to model the spatial interaction dependency, we build a Motion State Encoder to incorporate high-order motion state attributes, such as acceleration, jerk, heading, etc. To further refine the trajectory prediction, we propose a Lightweight Proposal Refinement Module that leverages Multi-Layer Perceptrons for trajectory embedding and generates the refined trajectories with fewer model parameters. Experiment results on the Argoverse 1 dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline HiVT-64, reducing the minADE by approximately 4.35%, the minFDE by 8.74%, and the MR by 20%. We also achieve higher accuracy than HiVT-128 with a 68% reduction in model size.

<title>What's Making That Sound Right Now? Video-centric Audio-Visual Localization</title>

Abstract: Audio-Visual Localization (AVL) aims to identify sound-emitting sources within a visual scene. However, existing studies focus on image-level audio-visual associations, failing to capture temporal dynamics. Moreover, they assume simplified scenarios where sound sources are always visible and involve only a single object. To address these limitations, we propose AVATAR, a video-centric AVL benchmark that incorporates high-resolution temporal information. AVATAR introduces four distinct scenarios -- Single-sound, Mixed-sound, Multi-entity, and Off-screen -- enabling a more comprehensive evaluation of AVL models. Additionally, we present TAVLO, a novel video-centric AVL model that explicitly integrates temporal information. Experimental results show that conventional methods struggle to track temporal variations due to their reliance on global audio features and frame-level mappings. In contrast, TAVLO achieves robust and precise audio-visual alignment by leveraging high-resolution temporal modeling. Our work empirically demonstrates the importance of temporal dynamics in AVL and establishes a new standard for video-centric audio-visual localization.

<title>Identify, Isolate, and Purge: Mitigating Hallucinations in LVLMs via Self-Evolving Distillation</title>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advancements in numerous areas such as multimedia. However, hallucination issues significantly limit their credibility and application potential. Existing mitigation methods typically rely on external tools or the comparison of multi-round inference, which significantly increase inference time. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SE}lf-\textbf{E}volving \textbf{D}istillation (\textbf{SEED}), which identifies hallucinations within the inner knowledge of LVLMs, isolates and purges them, and then distills the purified knowledge back into the model, enabling self-evolution. Furthermore, we identified that traditional distillation methods are prone to inducing void spaces in the output space of LVLMs. To address this issue, we propose a Mode-Seeking Evolving approach, which performs distillation to capture the dominant modes of the purified knowledge distribution, thereby avoiding the chaotic results that could emerge from void spaces. Moreover, we introduce a Hallucination Elimination Adapter, which corrects the dark knowledge of the original model by learning purified knowledge. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate the superiority of our SEED, demonstrating substantial improvements in mitigating hallucinations for representative LVLM models such as LLaVA-1.5 and InternVL2. Remarkably, the F1 score of LLaVA-1.5 on the hallucination evaluation metric POPE-Random improved from 81.3 to 88.3.

<title>Bridging KAN and MLP: MJKAN, a Hybrid Architecture with Both Efficiency and Expressiveness</title>

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have garnered attention for replacing fixed activation functions with learnable univariate functions, but they exhibit practical limitations, including high computational costs and performance deficits in general classification tasks. In this paper, we propose the Modulation Joint KAN (MJKAN), a novel neural network layer designed to overcome these challenges. MJKAN integrates a FiLM (Feature-wise Linear Modulation)-like mechanism with Radial Basis Function (RBF) activations, creating a hybrid architecture that combines the non-linear expressive power of KANs with the efficiency of Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). We empirically validated MJKAN's performance across a diverse set of benchmarks, including function regression, image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10/100), and natural language processing (AG News, SMS Spam). The results demonstrate that MJKAN achieves superior approximation capabilities in function regression tasks, significantly outperforming MLPs, with performance improving as the number of basis functions increases. Conversely, in image and text classification, its performance was competitive with MLPs but revealed a critical dependency on the number of basis functions. We found that a smaller basis size was crucial for better generalization, highlighting that the model's capacity must be carefully tuned to the complexity of the data to prevent overfitting. In conclusion, MJKAN offers a flexible architecture that inherits the theoretical advantages of KANs while improving computational efficiency and practical viability.

<title>Tempo-R0: A Video-MLLM for Temporal Video Grounding through Efficient Temporal Sensing Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Temporal Video Grounding (TVG), which requires pinpointing relevant temporal segments from video based on language query, has always been a highly challenging task in the field of video understanding. Videos often have a larger volume of information and redundancy than texts or images. Models should present comprehensive understanding of the whole video to accurately retrieve query-relevant clips. We thus propose Tempo-R0: a Video Multimodal Large Language Model (Video-MLLM) for the temporal video grounding task via multimodal temporal sensing reinforcement. Specifically, during the preprocessing stage of our pipeline, we employ Self-adaptive Attention Allocation (SAA) method based on frame content variation to efficiently use the MLLM's limited attention. The Explicit Timestamp-modal Aligned (ETA) method is also utilized to strengthen our model's capability to perceive the boundaries of events in the video. In the fine-tuning part of our pipeline, we creatively apply Partial Irrelevance Refusing-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (PIR-GRPO) in TVG area to foster model's temporal reasoning from not only accepting relevant video-query pairs but also refusing irrelevant ones. Experiments demonstrate that our method accomplishes a notable advantage over SOTA solutions by around 3.5% on both the original QVHighlights testbench and its corrected version with more reasonable ground truth annotations.

Abstract: Understanding how cellular morphology, gene expression, and spatial organization jointly shape tissue function is a central challenge in biology. Image-based spatial transcriptomics technologies now provide high-resolution measurements of cell images and gene expression profiles, but machine learning methods typically analyze these modalities in isolation or at limited resolution. We address the problem of learning unified, spatially aware representations that integrate cell morphology, gene expression, and spatial context across biological scales. This requires models that can operate at single-cell resolution, reason across spatial neighborhoods, and generalize to whole-slide tissue organization. Here, we introduce SPATIA, a multi-scale generative and predictive model for spatial transcriptomics. SPATIA learns cell-level embeddings by fusing image-derived morphological tokens and transcriptomic vector tokens using cross-attention and then aggregates them at niche and tissue levels using transformer modules to capture spatial dependencies. SPATIA incorporates token merging in its generative diffusion decoder to synthesize high-resolution cell images conditioned on gene expression. We assembled a multi-scale dataset consisting of 17 million cell-gene pairs, 1 million niche-gene pairs, and 10,000 tissue-gene pairs across 49 donors, 17 tissue types, and 12 disease states. We benchmark SPATIA against 13 existing models across 12 individual tasks, which span several categories including cell annotation, cell clustering, gene imputation, cross-modal prediction, and image generation. SPATIA achieves improved performance over all baselines and generates realistic cell morphologies that reflect transcriptomic perturbations.

Abstract: Urban general intelligence (UGI) refers to the capacity of AI systems to autonomously perceive, reason, and act within dynamic and complex urban environments. In this paper, we introduce UrbanMind, a tool-enhanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework designed to facilitate UGI. Central to UrbanMind is a novel architecture based on Continual Retrieval-Augmented MoE-based LLM (C-RAG-LLM), which dynamically incorporates domain-specific knowledge and evolving urban data to support long-term adaptability. The architecture of C-RAG-LLM aligns naturally with a multilevel optimization framework, where different layers are treated as interdependent sub-problems. Each layer has distinct objectives and can be optimized either independently or jointly through a hierarchical learning process. The framework is highly flexible, supporting both end-to-end training and partial layer-wise optimization based on resource or deployment constraints. To remain adaptive under data drift, it is further integrated with an incremental corpus updating mechanism. Evaluations on real-world urban tasks of a variety of complexity verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. This work presents a promising step toward the realization of general-purpose LLM agents in future urban environments.

<title>Geometric-Guided Few-Shot Dental Landmark Detection with Human-Centric Foundation Model</title>

Abstract: Accurate detection of anatomic landmarks is essential for assessing alveolar bone and root conditions, thereby optimizing clinical outcomes in orthodontics, periodontics, and implant dentistry. Manual annotation of landmarks on cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) by dentists is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and subject to inter-observer variability. Deep learning-based automated methods present a promising approach to streamline this process efficiently. However, the scarcity of training data and the high cost of expert annotations hinder the adoption of conventional deep learning techniques. To overcome these challenges, we introduce GeoSapiens, a novel few-shot learning framework designed for robust dental landmark detection using limited annotated CBCT of anterior teeth. Our GeoSapiens framework comprises two key components: (1) a robust baseline adapted from Sapiens, a foundational model that has achieved state-of-the-art performance in human-centric vision tasks, and (2) a novel geometric loss function that improves the model's capacity to capture critical geometric relationships among anatomical structures. Experiments conducted on our collected dataset of anterior teeth landmarks revealed that GeoSapiens surpassed existing landmark detection methods, outperforming the leading approach by an 8.18% higher success detection rate at a strict 0.5 mm threshold-a standard widely recognized in dental diagnostics. Code is available at: https://github.com/xmed-lab/GeoSapiens.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by Large Language Models (LLM-MAS) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in collaborative problem-solving. While LLM-MAS exhibit strong collaborative abilities, the security risks in their communication and coordination remain underexplored. We bridge this gap by systematically investigating intention-hiding threats in LLM-MAS, and design four representative attack paradigms that subtly disrupt task completion while maintaining high concealment. These attacks are evaluated in centralized, decentralized, and layered communication structures. Experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro, HumanEval, GSM8K, arithmetic, and biographies, demonstrate that they exhibit strong disruptive capabilities. To identify these threats, we propose a psychology-based detection framework AgentXposed, which combines the HEXACO personality model with the Reid Technique, using progressive questionnaire inquiries and behavior-based monitoring. Experiments conducted on six types of attacks show that our detection framework effectively identifies all types of malicious behaviors. The detection rate for our intention-hiding attacks is slightly lower than that of the two baselines, Incorrect Fact Injection and Dark Traits Injection, demonstrating the effectiveness of intention concealment. Our findings reveal the structural and behavioral risks posed by intention-hiding attacks and offer valuable insights into securing LLM-based multi-agent systems through psychological perspectives, which contributes to a deeper understanding of multi-agent safety. The code and data are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AgentXposed-F814.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in translating textual prompts into high-fidelity images. ControlNets further extend these models by allowing precise, image-based conditioning (e.g., edge maps, depth, pose), enabling fine-grained control over structure and style. However, their dependence on large, publicly scraped datasets -- and the increasing use of community-shared data for fine-tuning -- exposes them to stealthy data poisoning attacks. In this work, we introduce a novel data poisoning method that manipulates ControlNets to generate images containing specific content without any text triggers. By injecting poisoned samples -- each pairing a subtly triggered input with an NSFW target -- the model retains clean-prompt fidelity yet reliably produces NSFW outputs when the trigger is present. On large-scale, high-quality datasets, our backdoor achieves high attack success rate while remaining imperceptible in raw inputs. These results reveal a critical vulnerability in open-source ControlNets pipelines and underscore the need for robust data sanitization and defense mechanisms.

Abstract: In this paper we study word stress representations learned by self-supervised speech models (S3M), specifically the Wav2vec 2.0 model. We investigate the S3M representations of word stress for five different languages: Three languages with variable or lexical stress (Dutch, English and German) and two languages with fixed or demarcative stress (Hungarian and Polish). We train diagnostic stress classifiers on S3M embeddings and show that they can distinguish between stressed and unstressed syllables in read-aloud short sentences with high accuracy. We also tested language-specificity effects of S3M word stress. The results indicate that the word stress representations are language-specific, with a greater difference between the set of variable versus the set of fixed stressed languages.

Abstract: Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is fundamental to fluid dynamics, yet deep learning applications face significant hurdles. A critical gap exists: the lack of comprehensive evaluation of how diverse optical flow models perform specifically on PIV data, largely due to limitations in available datasets and the absence of a standardized benchmark. This prevents fair comparison and hinders progress. To address this, our primary contribution is a novel, large-scale synthetic PIV benchmark dataset generated from diverse CFD simulations (JHTDB and Blasius). It features unprecedented variety in particle densities, flow velocities, and continuous motion, enabling, for the first time, a standardized and rigorous evaluation of various optical flow and PIV algorithms. Complementing this, we propose Multi Cost Volume PIV (MCFormer), a new deep network architecture leveraging multi-frame temporal information and multiple cost volumes, specifically designed for PIV's sparse nature. Our comprehensive benchmark evaluation, the first of its kind, reveals significant performance variations among adapted optical flow models and demonstrates that MCFormer significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving the lowest overall normalized endpoint error (NEPE). This work provides both a foundational benchmark resource essential for future PIV research and a state-of-the-art method tailored for PIV challenges. We make our benchmark dataset and code publicly available to foster future research in this area.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various fields with their exceptional capabilities in understanding, processing, and generating human-like text. This paper investigates the potential of LLMs in advancing Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), analyzing current challenges, methodologies, and future opportunities. It begins by establishing a foundational understanding of NIDS and LLMs, exploring the enabling technologies that bridge the gap between intelligent and cognitive systems in AI-driven NIDS. While Intelligent NIDS leverage machine learning and deep learning to detect threats based on learned patterns, they often lack contextual awareness and explainability. In contrast, Cognitive NIDS integrate LLMs to process both structured and unstructured security data, enabling deeper contextual reasoning, explainable decision-making, and automated response for intrusion behaviors. Practical implementations are then detailed, highlighting LLMs as processors, detectors, and explainers within a comprehensive AI-driven NIDS pipeline. Furthermore, the concept of an LLM-centered Controller is proposed, emphasizing its potential to coordinate intrusion detection workflows, optimizing tool collaboration and system performance. Finally, this paper identifies critical challenges and opportunities, aiming to foster innovation in developing reliable, adaptive, and explainable NIDS. By presenting the transformative potential of LLMs, this paper seeks to inspire advancement in next-generation network security systems.

Abstract: Personalized text generation has become crucial for adapting language models to diverse and evolving users' personal context across cultural, temporal, and contextual dimensions. While existing methods often rely on centralized fine-tuning or static preference alignment, they struggle to achieve real-time adaptation under resource constraints inherent to personal devices. This limitation creates a dilemma: large cloud-based models lack access to localized user-specific information, while small on-device models cannot match the generation quality of their cloud counterparts. To address this dichotomy, we present CoSteer, a novel collaborative framework that enables decoding-time personalization through localized delta steering. Our key insight lies in leveraging the logits difference between personal context-aware and -agnostic outputs from local small models as steering signals for cloud-based LLMs. Specifically, we formulate token-level optimization as an online learning problem, where local delta vectors dynamically adjust the remote LLM's logits within the on-device environment. This approach preserves privacy by transmitting only the final steered tokens rather than raw data or intermediate vectors, while maintaining cloud-based LLMs' general capabilities without fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments on various personalized generation tasks, we demonstrate that CoSteer effectively assists LLMs in generating personalized content by leveraging locally stored user profiles and histories, ensuring privacy preservation through on-device data processing while maintaining acceptable computational overhead.

Abstract: Current legal frameworks consider AI-generated works eligible for copyright protection when they meet originality requirements and involve substantial human intellectual input. However, systematic legal standards and reliable evaluation methods for AI art copyrights are lacking. Through comprehensive analysis of legal precedents, we establish three essential criteria for determining distinctive artistic style: stylistic consistency, creative uniqueness, and expressive accuracy. To address these challenges, we introduce ArtBulb, an interpretable and quantifiable framework for AI art copyright judgment that combines a novel style description-based multimodal clustering method with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). We also present AICD, the first benchmark dataset for AI art copyright annotated by artists and legal experts. Experimental results demonstrate that ArtBulb outperforms existing models in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Our work aims to bridge the gap between the legal and technological communities and bring greater attention to the societal issue of AI art copyrights.

Abstract: Motion planning is a crucial component of autonomous robot driving. While various trajectory datasets exist, effectively utilizing them for a target domain remains challenging due to differences in agent interactions and environmental characteristics. Conventional approaches, such as domain adaptation or ensemble learning, leverage multiple source datasets but suffer from domain imbalance, catastrophic forgetting, and high computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose Interaction-Merged Motion Planning (IMMP), a novel approach that leverages parameter checkpoints trained on different domains during adaptation to the target domain. IMMP follows a two-step process: pre-merging to capture agent behaviors and interactions, sufficiently extracting diverse information from the source domain, followed by merging to construct an adaptable model that efficiently transfers diverse interactions to the target domain. Our method is evaluated on various planning benchmarks and models, demonstrating superior performance compared to conventional approaches.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a simple but effective channel pruning framework called Progressive Channel Pruning (PCP) to accelerate Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In contrast to the existing channel pruning methods that prune channels only once per layer in a layer-by-layer fashion, our new progressive framework iteratively prunes a small number of channels from several selected layers, which consists of a three-step attempting-selecting-pruning pipeline in each iteration. In the attempting step, we attempt to prune a pre-defined number of channels from one layer by using any existing channel pruning methods and estimate the accuracy drop for this layer based on the labelled samples in the validation set. In the selecting step, based on the estimated accuracy drops for all layers, we propose a greedy strategy to automatically select a set of layers that will lead to less overall accuracy drop after pruning these layers. In the pruning step, we prune a small number of channels from these selected layers. We further extend our PCP framework to prune channels for the deep transfer learning methods like Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN), in which we effectively reduce the data distribution mismatch in the channel pruning process by using both labelled samples from the source domain and pseudo-labelled samples from the target domain. Our comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our PCP framework outperforms the existing channel pruning approaches under both supervised learning and transfer learning settings.

Abstract: Pun generation seeks to creatively modify linguistic elements in text to produce humour or evoke double meanings. It also aims to preserve coherence and contextual appropriateness, making it useful in creative writing and entertainment across various media and contexts. Although pun generation has received considerable attention in computational linguistics, there is currently no dedicated survey that systematically reviews this specific area. To bridge this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of pun generation datasets and methods across different stages, including conventional approaches, deep learning techniques, and pre-trained language models. Additionally, we summarise both automated and human evaluation metrics used to assess the quality of pun generation. Finally, we discuss the research challenges and propose promising directions for future work.

Abstract: The task of describing video content in natural language is commonly referred to as video captioning. Unlike conventional video captions, which are typically brief and widely available, long-form paragraph descriptions in natural language are scarce. This limitation of current datasets is due to the expensive human manual annotation required and to the highly challenging task of explaining the language formation process from the perspective of the underlying story, as a complex system of interconnected events in space and time. Through a thorough analysis of recently published methods and available datasets, we identify a general lack of published resources dedicated to the problem of describing videos in complex language, beyond the level of descriptions in the form of enumerations of simple captions. Furthermore, while state-of-the-art methods produce impressive results on the task of generating shorter captions from videos by direct end-to-end learning between the videos and text, the problem of explaining the relationship between vision and language is still beyond our reach. In this work, we propose a shared representation between vision and language, based on graphs of events in space and time, which can be obtained in an explainable and analytical way, to integrate and connect multiple vision tasks to produce the final natural language description. Moreover, we also demonstrate how our automated and explainable video description generation process can function as a fully automatic teacher to effectively train direct, end-to-end neural student pathways, within a self-supervised neuro-analytical system. We validate that our explainable neuro-analytical approach generates coherent, rich and relevant textual descriptions on videos collected from multiple varied datasets, using both standard evaluation metrics, human annotations and consensus from ensembles of state-of-the-art VLMs.

<title>Fast-VGAN: Lightweight Voice Conversion with Explicit Control of F0 and Duration Parameters</title>

Abstract: Precise control over speech characteristics, such as pitch, duration, and speech rate, remains a significant challenge in the field of voice conversion. The ability to manipulate parameters like pitch and syllable rate is an important element for effective identity conversion, but can also be used independently for voice transformation, achieving goals that were historically addressed by vocoder-based methods.
  In this work, we explore a convolutional neural network-based approach that aims to provide means for modifying fundamental frequency (F0), phoneme sequences, intensity, and speaker identity. Rather than relying on disentanglement techniques, our model is explicitly conditioned on these factors to generate mel spectrograms, which are then converted into waveforms using a universal neural vocoder. Accordingly, during inference, F0 contours, phoneme sequences, and speaker embeddings can be freely adjusted, allowing for intuitively controlled voice transformations.
  We evaluate our approach on speaker conversion and expressive speech tasks using both perceptual and objective metrics. The results suggest that the proposed method offers substantial flexibility, while maintaining high intelligibility and speaker similarity.

<title>Towards Human-in-the-Loop Onset Detection: A Transfer Learning Approach for Maracatu</title>

Abstract: We explore transfer learning strategies for musical onset detection in the Afro-Brazilian Maracatu tradition, which features complex rhythmic patterns that challenge conventional models. We adapt two Temporal Convolutional Network architectures: one pre-trained for onset detection (intra-task) and another for beat tracking (inter-task). Using only 5-second annotated snippets per instrument, we fine-tune these models through layer-wise retraining strategies for five traditional percussion instruments. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over baseline performance, with F1 scores reaching up to 0.998 in the intra-task setting and improvements of over 50 percentage points in best-case scenarios. The cross-task adaptation proves particularly effective for time-keeping instruments, where onsets naturally align with beat positions. The optimal fine-tuning configuration varies by instrument, highlighting the importance of instrument-specific adaptation strategies. This approach addresses the challenges of underrepresented musical traditions, offering an efficient human-in-the-loop methodology that minimizes annotation effort while maximizing performance. Our findings contribute to more inclusive music information retrieval tools applicable beyond Western musical contexts.

<title>A Novel Approach for Estimating Positive Lyapunov Exponents in One-Dimensional Chaotic Time Series Using Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: Understanding and quantifying chaos in nonlinear dynamical systems remains a fundamental challenge in science and engineering. The Lyapunov exponent is a key measure of chaotic behavior, but its accurate estimation from experimental data is often hindered by methodological and computational limitations. In this work, we present a novel machine-learning-based approach for estimating the positive Lyapunov exponent (MLE) from one-dimensional time series, using the growth of out-of-sample prediction errors as a proxy for trajectory divergence. Our method demonstrates high scientific relevance, offering a robust, data-driven alternative to traditional analytic techniques. Through comprehensive testing on several canonical chaotic maps - including the logistic, sine, cubic, and Chebyshev maps - we achieved a coefficient of determination R2pos > 0.9 between predicted and theoretical MLE values for time series as short as M = 200 points. The best accuracy was observed for the Chebyshev map (R2pos = 0.999). Notably, the proposed method maintains high computational efficiency and generalizes well across various machine learning algorithms. These results highlight the significance of our approach for practical chaos analysis in both synthetic and experimental settings, opening new possibilities for robust nonlinear dynamics assessment when only time series data are available.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is closely linked to the malignant transformation of colorectal polyps, making early detection essential. However, current models struggle with detecting small lesions, accurately localizing boundaries, and providing interpretable decisions. To address these issues, we propose HGNet, which integrates High-Order Spatial Awareness Hypergraph and Multi-Scale Context Attention. Key innovations include: (1) an Efficient Multi-Scale Context Attention (EMCA) module to enhance lesion feature representation and boundary modeling; (2) the deployment of a spatial hypergraph convolution module before the detection head to capture higher-order spatial relationships between nodes; (3) the application of transfer learning to address the scarcity of medical image data; and (4) Eigen Class Activation Map (Eigen-CAM) for decision visualization. Experimental results show that HGNet achieves 94% accuracy, 90.6% recall, and 90% mAP@0.5, significantly improving small lesion differentiation and clinical interpretability. The source code will be made publicly available upon publication of this paper.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) systems are increasingly used in safety-critical applications, yet their security remains severely underexplored. This work investigates backdoor attacks, which implant hidden triggers that cause malicious actions only when specific inputs appear in the observation space. Existing DRL backdoor research focuses solely on training-time attacks requiring unrealistic access to the training pipeline. In contrast, we reveal critical vulnerabilities across the DRL supply chain where backdoors can be embedded with significantly reduced adversarial privileges. We introduce two novel attacks: (1) TrojanentRL, which exploits component-level flaws to implant a persistent backdoor that survives full model retraining; and (2) InfrectroRL, a post-training backdoor attack which requires no access to training, validation, nor test data. Empirical and analytical evaluations across six Atari environments show our attacks rival state-of-the-art training-time backdoor attacks while operating under much stricter adversarial constraints. We also demonstrate that InfrectroRL further evades two leading DRL backdoor defenses. These findings challenge the current research focus and highlight the urgent need for robust defenses.

<title>Emergent Semantics Beyond Token Embeddings: Transformer LMs with Frozen Visual Unicode Representations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Understanding the locus of semantic representation in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for interpretability and architectural innovation. The dominant paradigm posits that trainable input embeddings serve as foundational "meaning vectors." This paper challenges that view. We construct Transformer models where the embedding layer is entirely frozen, with vectors derived not from data, but from the visual structure of Unicode glyphs. These non-semantic, precomputed visual embeddings are fixed throughout training. Our method is compatible with any tokenizer, including a novel Unicode-centric tokenizer we introduce to ensure universal text coverage. Despite the absence of trainable, semantically initialized embeddings, our models converge, generate coherent text, and, critically, outperform architecturally identical models with trainable embeddings on the MMLU reasoning benchmark. We attribute this to "representational interference" in conventional models, where the embedding layer is burdened with learning both structural and semantic features. Our results indicate that high-level semantics are not inherent to input embeddings but are an emergent property of the Transformer's compositional architecture and data scale. This reframes the role of embeddings from meaning containers to structural primitives. We release all code and models to foster further research.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) systems are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries train their local models on poisoned data and submit poisoned model updates to compromise the global model. Despite numerous proposed attacks and defenses, divergent experimental settings, implementation errors, and unrealistic assumptions hinder fair comparisons and valid conclusions about their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. To address this, we introduce BackFed - a comprehensive benchmark suite designed to standardize, streamline, and reliably evaluate backdoor attacks and defenses in FL, with a focus on practical constraints. Our benchmark offers key advantages through its multi-processing implementation that significantly accelerates experimentation and the modular design that enables seamless integration of new methods via well-defined APIs. With a standardized evaluation pipeline, we envision BackFed as a plug-and-play environment for researchers to comprehensively and reliably evaluate new attacks and defenses. Using BackFed, we conduct large-scale studies of representative backdoor attacks and defenses across both Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing tasks with diverse model architectures and experimental settings. Our experiments critically assess the performance of proposed attacks and defenses, revealing unknown limitations and modes of failures under practical conditions. These empirical insights provide valuable guidance for the development of new methods and for enhancing the security of FL systems. Our framework is openly available at https://github.com/thinh-dao/BackFed.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant advances in visual understanding tasks involving both images and videos. However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric video data remains underexplored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive and high-quality evaluation benchmarks. Existing human-centric benchmarks predominantly emphasize video generation quality and action recognition, while overlooking essential perceptual and cognitive abilities required in human-centered scenarios. Furthermore, they are often limited by single-question paradigms and overly simplistic evaluation metrics. To address above limitations, we propose a modern HV-MMBench, a rigorously curated benchmark designed to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric video understanding. Compared to existing human-centric video benchmarks, our work offers the following key features: (1) Diverse evaluation dimensions: HV-MMBench encompasses 15 tasks, ranging from basic attribute perception (e.g., age estimation, emotion recognition) to advanced cognitive reasoning (e.g., social relationship prediction, intention prediction), enabling comprehensive assessment of model capabilities; (2) Varied data types: The benchmark includes multiple-choice, fill-in-blank, true/false, and open-ended question formats, combined with diverse evaluation metrics, to more accurately and robustly reflect model performance; (3) Multi-domain video coverage: The benchmark spans 50 distinct visual scenarios, enabling comprehensive evaluation across fine-grained scene variations; (4) Temporal coverage: The benchmark covers videos from short-term (10 seconds) to long-term (up to 30min) durations, supporting systematic analysis of models temporal reasoning abilities across diverse contextual lengths.

Abstract: Understanding leadership dynamics in collective behavior is a key challenge in animal ecology, swarm robotics, and intelligent transportation. Traditional information-theoretic approaches, including Transfer Entropy (TE) and Time-Lagged Mutual Information (TLMI), have been widely used to infer leader-follower relationships but face critical limitations in noisy or short-duration datasets due to their reliance on robust probability estimations. This study proposes a method based on dynamic network inference using time-lagged correlations across multiple kinematic variables: velocity, acceleration, and direction. Our approach constructs directed influence graphs over time, enabling the identification of leadership patterns without the need for large volumes of data or parameter-sensitive discretization. We validate our method through two multi-agent simulations in NetLogo: a modified Vicsek model with informed leaders and a predator-prey model featuring coordinated and independent wolf groups. Experimental results demonstrate that the network-based method outperforms TE and TLMI in scenarios with limited spatiotemporal observations, ranking true leaders at the top of influence metrics more consistently than TE and TLMI.

Abstract: Reasoning about the trajectories of multiple, interacting objects is integral to physical reasoning tasks in machine learning. This involves conditions imposed on the objects at different time steps, for instance initial states or desired goal states. Existing approaches in physical reasoning generally rely on autoregressive modeling, which can only be conditioned on initial states, but not on later states. In fields such as planning for reinforcement learning, similar challenges are being addressed with denoising diffusion models. In this work, we propose an object-centric denoising diffusion model architecture for physical reasoning that is translation equivariant over time, permutation equivariant over objects, and can be conditioned on arbitrary time steps for arbitrary objects. We demonstrate how this model can solve tasks with multiple conditions and examine its performance when changing object numbers and trajectory lengths during inference.

Abstract: We introduce DC-AR, a novel masked autoregressive (AR) text-to-image generation framework that delivers superior image generation quality with exceptional computational efficiency. Due to the tokenizers' limitations, prior masked AR models have lagged behind diffusion models in terms of quality or efficiency. We overcome this limitation by introducing DC-HT - a deep compression hybrid tokenizer for AR models that achieves a 32x spatial compression ratio while maintaining high reconstruction fidelity and cross-resolution generalization ability. Building upon DC-HT, we extend MaskGIT and create a new hybrid masked autoregressive image generation framework that first produces the structural elements through discrete tokens and then applies refinements via residual tokens. DC-AR achieves state-of-the-art results with a gFID of 5.49 on MJHQ-30K and an overall score of 0.69 on GenEval, while offering 1.5-7.9x higher throughput and 2.0-3.5x lower latency compared to prior leading diffusion and autoregressive models.

Abstract: We propose Expotion (Facial Expression and Motion Control for Multimodal Music Generation), a generative model leveraging multimodal visual controls - specifically, human facial expressions and upper-body motion - as well as text prompts to produce expressive and temporally accurate music. We adopt parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) on the pretrained text-to-music generation model, enabling fine-grained adaptation to the multimodal controls using a small dataset. To ensure precise synchronization between video and music, we introduce a temporal smoothing strategy to align multiple modalities. Experiments demonstrate that integrating visual features alongside textual descriptions enhances the overall quality of generated music in terms of musicality, creativity, beat-tempo consistency, temporal alignment with the video, and text adherence, surpassing both proposed baselines and existing state-of-the-art video-to-music generation models. Additionally, we introduce a novel dataset consisting of 7 hours of synchronized video recordings capturing expressive facial and upper-body gestures aligned with corresponding music, providing significant potential for future research in multimodal and interactive music generation.

Abstract: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation shows great potential in fields such as film production. Despite significant advances, current V2A methods, which rely on global video information, struggle with complex scenes and often fail to generate audio tailored to specific objects or regions in the videos. To address these limitations, we introduce Hear-Your-Click, an interactive V2A framework that enables users to generate sounds for specific objects in the videos by simply clicking on the frame. To achieve this, we propose Object-aware Contrastive Audio-Visual Fine-tuning (OCAV) with a Mask-guided Visual Encoder (MVE) to obtain object-level visual features aligned with corresponding audio segments. Furthermore, we tailor two data augmentation strategies: Random Video Stitching (RVS) and Mask-guided Loudness Modulation (MLM), aimed at enhancing the model's sensitivity to the segmented objects. To effectively measure the audio-visual correspondence, we design a new evaluation metric, the CAV score, for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework offers more precise control and improved generation performance across various metrics. Project Page: https://github.com/SynapGrid/Hear-Your-Click

Abstract: The field of Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) has seen significant advancements in recent years due to the rapid progress of diffusion-based approaches. However, capturing vocal style, genre-specific pitch inflections, and language-dependent characteristics remains challenging, particularly in low-resource scenarios. To address this, we propose LAPS-Diff, a diffusion model integrated with language-aware embeddings and a vocal-style guided learning mechanism, specifically designed for Bollywood Hindi singing style. We curate a Hindi SVS dataset and leverage pre-trained language models to extract word and phone-level embeddings for an enriched lyrics representation. Additionally, we incorporated a style encoder and a pitch extraction model to compute style and pitch losses, capturing features essential to the naturalness and expressiveness of the synthesized singing, particularly in terms of vocal style and pitch variations. Furthermore, we utilize MERT and IndicWav2Vec models to extract musical and contextual embeddings, serving as conditional priors to refine the acoustic feature generation process further. Based on objective and subjective evaluations, we demonstrate that LAPS-Diff significantly improves the quality of the generated samples compared to the considered state-of-the-art (SOTA) model for our constrained dataset that is typical of the low resource scenario.

Abstract: T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires encode critical immunological signatures for autoimmune diseases, yet their clinical application remains limited by sequence sparsity and low witness rates. We developed EAMil, a multi-instance deep learning framework that leverages TCR sequencing data to diagnose systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with exceptional accuracy. By integrating PrimeSeq feature extraction with ESMonehot encoding and enhanced gate attention mechanisms, our model achieved state-of-the-art performance with AUCs of 98.95% for SLE and 97.76% for RA. EAMil successfully identified disease-associated genes with over 90% concordance with established differential analyses and effectively distinguished disease-specific TCR genes. The model demonstrated robustness in classifying multiple disease categories, utilizing the SLEDAI score to stratify SLE patients by disease severity as well as to diagnose the site of damage in SLE patients, and effectively controlling for confounding factors such as age and gender. This interpretable framework for immune receptor analysis provides new insights for autoimmune disease detection and classification with broad potential clinical applications across immune-mediated conditions.

Abstract: The Critical View of Safety (CVS) is crucial for safe laparoscopic cholecystectomy, yet assessing CVS criteria remains a complex and challenging task, even for experts. Traditional models for CVS recognition depend on vision-only models learning with costly, labor-intensive spatial annotations. This study investigates how text can be harnessed as a powerful tool for both training and inference in multi-modal surgical foundation models to automate CVS recognition. Unlike many existing multi-modal models, which are primarily adapted for multi-class classification, CVS recognition requires a multi-label framework. Zero-shot evaluation of existing multi-modal surgical models shows a significant performance gap for this task. To address this, we propose CVS-AdaptNet, a multi-label adaptation strategy that enhances fine-grained, binary classification across multiple labels by aligning image embeddings with textual descriptions of each CVS criterion using positive and negative prompts. By adapting PeskaVLP, a state-of-the-art surgical foundation model, on the Endoscapes-CVS201 dataset, CVS-AdaptNet achieves 57.6 mAP, improving over the ResNet50 image-only baseline (51.5 mAP) by 6 points. Our results show that CVS-AdaptNet's multi-label, multi-modal framework, enhanced by textual prompts, boosts CVS recognition over image-only methods. We also propose text-specific inference methods, that helps in analysing the image-text alignment. While further work is needed to match state-of-the-art spatial annotation-based methods, this approach highlights the potential of adapting generalist models to specialized surgical tasks.

Abstract: In-context learning enables transformer models to generalize to new tasks based solely on input prompts, without any need for weight updates. However, existing training paradigms typically rely on large, unstructured datasets that are costly to store, difficult to evaluate for quality and balance, and pose privacy and ethical concerns due to the inclusion of sensitive information. Motivated by these limitations and risks, we propose an alternative training strategy where we leverage a collection of multiple, small-scale, and domain-specific datasets. We empirically demonstrate that the increased quality and diversity of such data improve the generalization abilities of in-context learners beyond their training domain, while achieving comparable performance with models trained on a single large-scale dataset. We investigate this paradigm by leveraging meta-learning to train an in-context learner on the Meta-Album collection under several settings. Firstly, we show the performance in a controlled environment, where the test domain is completely excluded from the training knowledge. Secondly, we explore the robustness of these models to forgetting in a continual scenario where the information is accessible for a limited time. Finally, we explore the more challenging unsupervised scenario. Our findings demonstrate that transformers still generalize for in-context prediction when trained on a curated dataset collection while offering advantages in modularity and replaceability.

Abstract: Surgical AI often involves multiple tasks within a single procedure, like phase recognition or assessing the Critical View of Safety in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Traditional models, built for one task at a time, lack flexibility, requiring a separate model for each. To address this, we introduce MML-SurgAdapt, a unified multi-task framework with Vision-Language Models (VLMs), specifically CLIP, to handle diverse surgical tasks through natural language supervision. A key challenge in multi-task learning is the presence of partial annotations when integrating different tasks. To overcome this, we employ Single Positive Multi-Label (SPML) learning, which traditionally reduces annotation burden by training models with only one positive label per instance. Our framework extends this approach to integrate data from multiple surgical tasks within a single procedure, enabling effective learning despite incomplete or noisy annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a combined dataset consisting of Cholec80, Endoscapes2023, and CholecT50, utilizing custom prompts. Extensive evaluation shows that MML-SurgAdapt performs comparably to task-specific benchmarks, with the added advantage of handling noisy annotations. It also outperforms the existing SPML frameworks for the task. By reducing the required labels by 23%, our approach proposes a more scalable and efficient labeling process, significantly easing the annotation burden on clinicians. To our knowledge, this is the first application of SPML to integrate data from multiple surgical tasks, presenting a novel and generalizable solution for multi-task learning in surgical computer vision.

Abstract: Recently, research into chatbots (also known as conversational agents, AI agents, voice assistants), which are computer applications using artificial intelligence to mimic human-like conversation, has grown sharply. Despite this growth, sociology lags other disciplines (including computer science, medicine, psychology, and communication) in publishing about chatbots. We suggest sociology can advance understanding of human-chatbot interaction and offer four sociological theories to enhance extant work in this field. The first two theories (resource substitution theory, power-dependence theory) add new insights to existing models of the drivers of chatbot use, which overlook sociological concerns about how social structure (e.g., systemic discrimination, the uneven distribution of resources within networks) inclines individuals to use chatbots, including problematic levels of emotional dependency on chatbots. The second two theories (affect control theory, fundamental cause of disease theory) help inform the development of chatbot-driven interventions that minimize safety risks and enhance equity by leveraging sociological insights into how chatbot outputs could attend to cultural contexts (e.g., affective norms) to promote wellbeing and enhance communities (e.g., opportunities for civic participation). We discuss the value of applying sociological theories for advancing theorizing about human-chatbot interaction and developing chatbots for social good.

<title>INTER: Mitigating Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models by Interaction Guidance Sampling</title>

Abstract: Hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) pose significant challenges for real-world applications, as LVLMs may generate responses that appear plausible yet remain inconsistent with the associated visual content. This issue rarely occurs in human cognition. We argue that this discrepancy arises from humans' ability to effectively leverage multimodal interaction information in data samples. Specifically, humans typically first gather multimodal information, analyze the interactions across modalities for understanding, and then express their understanding through language. Motivated by this observation, we conduct extensive experiments on popular LVLMs and obtained insights that surprisingly reveal human-like, though less pronounced, cognitive behavior of LVLMs on multimodal samples. Building on these findings, we further propose \textbf{INTER}: \textbf{Inter}action Guidance Sampling, a novel training-free algorithm that mitigate hallucinations without requiring additional data. Specifically, INTER explicitly guides LVLMs to effectively reapply their understanding of multimodal interaction information when generating responses, thereby reducing potential hallucinations. On six benchmarks including VQA and image captioning tasks, INTER achieves an average improvement of up to 3.4\% on five LVLMs compared to the state-of-the-art decoding strategy. The code will be released when the paper is accepted.

Abstract: Recent advances have established a new machine learning paradigm based on scaling up compute at inference time as well as at training time. In that line of work, a combination of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on synthetic demonstrations and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is used for training Large Language Models to expend extra compute during inference in the form of "thoughts" expressed in natural language. In this paper, we propose to instead format these tokens as a multi-turn interaction trace with a stateful tool. At each turn, the new state of the tool is appended to the context of the model, whose job is to generate the tokens necessary to control the tool via a custom DSL. We benchmark this approach on the problem of repairing malfunctioning Python code, and show that this constrained setup allows for faster sampling of experience and a denser reward signal, allowing even models of size up to 3B parameters to learn how to proficiently expend additional compute on the task.

<title>ICAS: Detecting Training Data from Autoregressive Image Generative Models</title>

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation has witnessed rapid advancements, with prominent models such as scale-wise visual auto-regression pushing the boundaries of visual synthesis. However, these developments also raise significant concerns regarding data privacy and copyright. In response, training data detection has emerged as a critical task for identifying unauthorized data usage in model training. To better understand the vulnerability of autoregressive image generative models to such detection, we conduct the first study applying membership inference to this domain. Our approach comprises two key components: implicit classification and an adaptive score aggregation strategy. First, we compute the implicit token-wise classification score within the query image. Then we propose an adaptive score aggregation strategy to acquire a final score, which places greater emphasis on the tokens with lower scores. A higher final score indicates that the sample is more likely to be involved in the training set. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we adapt existing detection algorithms originally designed for LLMs to visual autoregressive models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in both class-conditional and text-to-image scenarios. Moreover, our approach exhibits strong robustness and generalization under various data transformations. Furthermore, sufficient experiments suggest two novel key findings: (1) A linear scaling law on membership inference, exposing the vulnerability of large foundation models. (2) Training data from scale-wise visual autoregressive models is easier to detect than other autoregressive paradigms.Our code is available at https://github.com/Chrisqcwx/ImageAR-MIA.

<title>Sequential Attention-based Sampling for Histopathological Analysis</title>

Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly applied for automated histopathology. Yet, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often acquired at gigapixel sizes, rendering it computationally infeasible to analyze them entirely at high resolution. Diagnostic labels are largely available only at the slide-level, because expert annotation of images at a finer (patch) level is both laborious and expensive. Moreover, regions with diagnostic information typically occupy only a small fraction of the WSI, making it inefficient to examine the entire slide at full resolution. Here, we propose SASHA -- {\it S}equential {\it A}ttention-based {\it S}ampling for {\it H}istopathological {\it A}nalysis -- a deep reinforcement learning approach for efficient analysis of histopathological images. First, SASHA learns informative features with a lightweight hierarchical, attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) model. Second, SASHA samples intelligently and zooms selectively into a small fraction (10-20\%) of high-resolution patches, to achieve reliable diagnosis. We show that SASHA matches state-of-the-art methods that analyze the WSI fully at high-resolution, albeit at a fraction of their computational and memory costs. In addition, it significantly outperforms competing, sparse sampling methods. We propose SASHA as an intelligent sampling model for medical imaging challenges that involve automated diagnosis with exceptionally large images containing sparsely informative features.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed human-machine interaction since ChatGPT's 2022 debut, with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) emerging as a key framework that enhances LLM outputs by integrating external knowledge. However, RAG's reliance on ingesting external documents introduces new vulnerabilities. This paper exposes a critical security gap at the data loading stage, where malicious actors can stealthily corrupt RAG pipelines by exploiting document ingestion.
  We propose a taxonomy of 9 knowledge-based poisoning attacks and introduce two novel threat vectors -- Content Obfuscation and Content Injection -- targeting common formats (DOCX, HTML, PDF). Using an automated toolkit implementing 19 stealthy injection techniques, we test five popular data loaders, finding a 74.4% attack success rate across 357 scenarios. We further validate these threats on six end-to-end RAG systems -- including white-box pipelines and black-box services like NotebookLM and OpenAI Assistants -- demonstrating high success rates and critical vulnerabilities that bypass filters and silently compromise output integrity. Our results emphasize the urgent need to secure the document ingestion process in RAG systems against covert content manipulations.

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction is critical for safe autonomous navigation, yet the impact of dataset design on model performance remains understudied. This work systematically examines how feature selection, cross-dataset transfer, and geographic diversity influence trajectory prediction accuracy in multi-agent settings. We evaluate a state-of-the-art model using our novel L4 Motion Forecasting dataset based on our own data recordings in Germany and the US. This includes enhanced map and agent features. We compare our dataset to the US-centric Argoverse 2 benchmark. First, we find that incorporating supplementary map and agent features unique to our dataset, yields no measurable improvement over baseline features, demonstrating that modern architectures do not need extensive feature sets for optimal performance. The limited features of public datasets are sufficient to capture convoluted interactions without added complexity. Second, we perform cross-dataset experiments to evaluate how effective domain knowledge can be transferred between datasets. Third, we group our dataset by country and check the knowledge transfer between different driving cultures.

Abstract: Deep learning-based computational methods have achieved promising results in predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs). However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on isolated pairwise evaluations, overlooking a model's capability to reconstruct biologically meaningful PPI networks, which is crucial for biology research. To address this gap, we introduce PRING, the first comprehensive benchmark that evaluates protein-protein interaction prediction from a graph-level perspective. PRING curates a high-quality, multi-species PPI network dataset comprising 21,484 proteins and 186,818 interactions, with well-designed strategies to address both data redundancy and leakage. Building on this golden-standard dataset, we establish two complementary evaluation paradigms: (1) topology-oriented tasks, which assess intra and cross-species PPI network construction, and (2) function-oriented tasks, including protein complex pathway prediction, GO module analysis, and essential protein justification. These evaluations not only reflect the model's capability to understand the network topology but also facilitate protein function annotation, biological module detection, and even disease mechanism analysis. Extensive experiments on four representative model categories, consisting of sequence similarity-based, naive sequence-based, protein language model-based, and structure-based approaches, demonstrate that current PPI models have potential limitations in recovering both structural and functional properties of PPI networks, highlighting the gap in supporting real-world biological applications. We believe PRING provides a reliable platform to guide the development of more effective PPI prediction models for the community. The dataset and source code of PRING are available at https://github.com/SophieSarceau/PRING.

Abstract: Historical documents represent an invaluable cultural heritage, yet have undergone significant degradation over time through tears, water erosion, and oxidation. Existing Historical Document Restoration (HDR) methods primarily focus on single modality or limited-size restoration, failing to meet practical needs. To fill this gap, we present a full-page HDR dataset (FPHDR) and a novel automated HDR solution (AutoHDR). Specifically, FPHDR comprises 1,633 real and 6,543 synthetic images with character-level and line-level locations, as well as character annotations in different damage grades. AutoHDR mimics historians' restoration workflows through a three-stage approach: OCR-assisted damage localization, vision-language context text prediction, and patch autoregressive appearance restoration. The modular architecture of AutoHDR enables seamless human-machine collaboration, allowing for flexible intervention and optimization at each restoration stage. Experiments demonstrate AutoHDR's remarkable performance in HDR. When processing severely damaged documents, our method improves OCR accuracy from 46.83\% to 84.05\%, with further enhancement to 94.25\% through human-machine collaboration. We believe this work represents a significant advancement in automated historical document restoration and contributes substantially to cultural heritage preservation. The model and dataset are available at https://github.com/SCUT-DLVCLab/AutoHDR.

Abstract: In the field of robotics, researchers face a critical challenge in ensuring reliable and efficient task planning. Verifying high-level task plans before execution significantly reduces errors and enhance the overall performance of these systems. In this paper, we propose an architecture for automatically verifying high-level task plans before their execution in simulator or real-world environments. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), our approach consists of two key steps: first, the conversion of natural language instructions into Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), followed by a comprehensive analysis of action sequences. The module uses the reasoning capabilities of the LLM to evaluate logical coherence and identify potential gaps in the plan. Rigorous testing on datasets of varying complexity demonstrates the broad applicability of the module to household tasks. We contribute to improving the reliability and efficiency of task planning and addresses the critical need for robust pre-execution verification in autonomous systems.

<title>LVM4CSI: Enabling Direct Application of Pre-Trained Large Vision Models for Wireless Channel Tasks</title>

Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) is critical to the performance of wireless communication systems, especially with the increasing scale and complexity introduced by 5G and future 6G technologies. While artificial intelligence (AI) offers a promising approach to CSI acquisition and utilization, existing methods largely depend on task-specific neural networks (NNs) that require expert-driven design and large training datasets, limiting their generalizability and practicality. To address these challenges, we propose LVM4CSI, a general and efficient framework that leverages the structural similarity between CSI and computer vision (CV) data to directly apply large vision models (LVMs) pre-trained on extensive CV datasets to wireless tasks without any fine-tuning, in contrast to large language model-based methods that generally necessitate fine-tuning. LVM4CSI maps CSI tasks to analogous CV tasks, transforms complex-valued CSI into visual formats compatible with LVMs, and integrates lightweight trainable layers to adapt extracted features to specific communication objectives. We validate LVM4CSI through three representative case studies, including channel estimation, human activity recognition, and user localization. Results demonstrate that LVM4CSI achieves comparable or superior performance to task-specific NNs, including an improvement exceeding 9.61 dB in channel estimation and approximately 40% reduction in localization error. Furthermore, it significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters and eliminates the need for task-specific NN design.

<title>An Evaluation of Large Language Models on Text Summarization Tasks Using Prompt Engineering Techniques</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance natural language processing with their ability to generate human-like text across a range of tasks. Despite the remarkable success of LLMs in Natural Language Processing (NLP), their performance in text summarization across various domains and datasets has not been comprehensively evaluated. At the same time, the ability to summarize text effectively without relying on extensive training data has become a crucial bottleneck. To address these issues, we present a systematic evaluation of six LLMs across four datasets: CNN/Daily Mail and NewsRoom (news), SAMSum (dialog), and ArXiv (scientific). By leveraging prompt engineering techniques including zero-shot and in-context learning, our study evaluates the performance using the ROUGE and BERTScore metrics. In addition, a detailed analysis of inference times is conducted to better understand the trade-off between summarization quality and computational efficiency. For Long documents, introduce a sentence-based chunking strategy that enables LLMs with shorter context windows to summarize extended inputs in multiple stages. The findings reveal that while LLMs perform competitively on news and dialog tasks, their performance on long scientific documents improves significantly when aided by chunking strategies. In addition, notable performance variations were observed based on model parameters, dataset properties, and prompt design. These results offer actionable insights into how different LLMs behave across task types, contributing to ongoing research in efficient, instruction-based NLP systems.

Abstract: Learning Japanese vocabulary is a challenge for learners from Roman alphabet backgrounds due to script differences. Japanese combines syllabaries like hiragana with kanji, which are logographic characters of Chinese origin. Kanji are also complicated due to their complexity and volume. Keyword mnemonics are a common strategy to aid memorization, often using the compositional structure of kanji to form vivid associations. Despite recent efforts to use large language models (LLMs) to assist learners, existing methods for LLM-based keyword mnemonic generation function as a black box, offering limited interpretability. We propose a generative framework that explicitly models the mnemonic construction process as driven by a set of common rules, and learn them using a novel Expectation-Maximization-type algorithm. Trained on learner-authored mnemonics from an online platform, our method learns latent structures and compositional rules, enabling interpretable and systematic mnemonics generation. Experiments show that our method performs well in the cold-start setting for new learners while providing insight into the mechanisms behind effective mnemonic creation.

<title>OGF: An Online Gradient Flow Method for Optimizing the Statistical Steady-State Time Averages of Unsteady Turbulent Flows</title>

Abstract: Turbulent flows are chaotic and unsteady, but their statistical distribution converges to a statistical steady state. Engineering quantities of interest typically take the form of time-average statistics such as $ \frac{1}{t} \int_0^t f ( u(x,\tau; \theta) ) d\tau \overset{t \rightarrow \infty}{\rightarrow} F(x; \theta)$, where $u(x,t; \theta)$ are solutions of the Navier--Stokes equations with parameters $\theta$. Optimizing over $F(x; \theta)$ has many engineering applications including geometric optimization, flow control, and closure modeling. However, this remains an open challenge, as existing computational approaches are incapable of scaling to physically representative numbers of grid points. The fundamental obstacle is the chaoticity of turbulent flows: gradients calculated with the adjoint method diverge exponentially as $t \rightarrow \infty$.
  We develop a new online gradient-flow (OGF) method that is scalable to large degree-of-freedom systems and enables optimizing for the steady-state statistics of chaotic, unsteady, turbulence-resolving simulations. The method forward-propagates an online estimate for the gradient of $F(x; \theta)$ while simultaneously performing online updates of the parameters $\theta$. A key feature is the fully online nature of the algorithm to facilitate faster optimization progress and its combination with a finite-difference estimator to avoid the divergence of gradients due to chaoticity. The proposed OGF method is demonstrated for optimizations over three chaotic ordinary and partial differential equations: the Lorenz-63 equation, the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation, and Navier--Stokes solutions of compressible, forced, homogeneous isotropic turbulence. In each case, the OGF method successfully reduces the loss based on $F(x; \theta)$ by several orders of magnitude and accurately recovers the optimal parameters.

Abstract: The severity of natural disasters is increasing every year, impacting many people's lives. During the response phase of disasters, airports are important hubs where relief aid arrives and people need to be evacuated. However, the airport often forms a bottleneck in these relief operations due to the sudden need for increased capacity. Limited research has been done on the operational side of airport disaster management. Experts identify the main problems as, first, the asymmetry of information between the airport and incoming flights, and second, the lack of resources. The goal of this research is to understand the effects of incomplete knowledge of incoming flights with different resource allocation strategies on the performance of cargo handling operations at an airport after a natural disaster. An agent-based model is created, implementing realistic offloading strategies with different degrees of information uncertainty. Model calibration and verification are performed with experts in the field. The model performance is measured by the average turnaround time, which is divided into offloading time, boarding time, and cumulative waiting times. The results show that the effects of one unplanned aircraft are negligible. However, all waiting times increase with more arriving unplanned aircraft.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess an extraordinary capability to produce text that is not only coherent and contextually relevant but also strikingly similar to human writing. They adapt to various styles and genres, producing content that is both grammatically correct and semantically meaningful. Recently, LLMs have been misused to create highly realistic phishing emails, spread fake news, generate code to automate cyber crime, and write fraudulent scientific articles. Additionally, in many real-world applications, the generated content including style and topic and the generator model are not known beforehand. The increasing prevalence and sophistication of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated texts have made their detection progressively more challenging. Various attempts have been made to distinguish machine-generated text from human-authored content using linguistic, statistical, machine learning, and ensemble-based approaches. This work focuses on two primary objectives Task-A, which involves distinguishing human-written text from machine-generated text, and Task-B, which attempts to identify the specific LLM model responsible for the generation. Both of these tasks are based on fine tuning of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT_4o-mini), Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA) 3 8B, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). The fine-tuned version of GPT_4o-mini and the BERT model has achieved accuracies of 0.9547 for Task-A and 0.4698 for Task-B.

Abstract: The recent proliferation of photorealistic AI-generated images (AIGI) has raised urgent concerns about their potential misuse, particularly on social media platforms. Current state-of-the-art AIGI detection methods typically rely on large, deep neural architectures, creating significant computational barriers to real-time, large-scale deployment on platforms like social media. To challenge this reliance on computationally intensive models, we introduce LAID, the first framework -- to our knowledge -- that benchmarks and evaluates the detection performance and efficiency of off-the-shelf lightweight neural networks. In this framework, we comprehensively train and evaluate selected models on a representative subset of the GenImage dataset across spatial, spectral, and fusion image domains. Our results demonstrate that lightweight models can achieve competitive accuracy, even under adversarial conditions, while incurring substantially lower memory and computation costs compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This study offers valuable insight into the trade-off between efficiency and performance in AIGI detection and lays a foundation for the development of practical, scalable, and trustworthy detection systems.

Abstract: World Model, the supposed algorithmic surrogate of the real-world environment which biological agents experience with and act upon, has been an emerging topic in recent years because of the rising needs to develop virtual agents with artificial (general) intelligence. There has been much debate on what a world model really is, how to build it, how to use it, and how to evaluate it. In this essay, starting from the imagination in the famed Sci-Fi classic Dune, and drawing inspiration from the concept of "hypothetical thinking" in psychology literature, we offer critiques of several schools of thoughts on world modeling, and argue the primary goal of a world model to be simulating all actionable possibilities of the real world for purposeful reasoning and acting. Building on the critiques, we propose a new architecture for a general-purpose world model, based on hierarchical, multi-level, and mixed continuous/discrete representations, and a generative and self-supervision learning framework, with an outlook of a Physical, Agentic, and Nested (PAN) AGI system enabled by such a model.

Abstract: Empathetic interaction is a cornerstone of human-machine communication, due to the need for understanding speech enriched with paralinguistic cues and generating emotional and expressive responses. However, the most powerful empathetic LSLMs are increasingly closed off, leaving the crucial details about the architecture, data and development opaque to researchers. Given the critical need for transparent research into the LSLMs and empathetic behavior, we present OpenS2S, a fully open-source, transparent and end-to-end LSLM designed to enable empathetic speech interactions. Based on our empathetic speech-to-text model BLSP-Emo, OpenS2S further employs a streaming interleaved decoding architecture to achieve low-latency speech generation. To facilitate end-to-end training, OpenS2S incorporates an automated data construction pipeline that synthesizes diverse, high-quality empathetic speech dialogues at low cost. By leveraging large language models to generate empathetic content and controllable text-to-speech systems to introduce speaker and emotional variation, we construct a scalable training corpus with rich paralinguistic diversity and minimal human supervision. We release the fully open-source OpenS2S model, including the dataset, model weights, pre-training and fine-tuning codes, to empower the broader research community and accelerate innovation in empathetic speech systems.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems, current benchmarks fall short in evaluating their scalability, robustness, and coordination capabilities in complex, dynamic, real-world tasks. Existing environments typically focus on small-scale, fully observable, or low-complexity domains, limiting their utility for developing and assessing next-generation multi-agent Agentic AI frameworks. We introduce CREW-Wildfire, an open-source benchmark designed to close this gap. Built atop the human-AI teaming CREW simulation platform, CREW-Wildfire offers procedurally generated wildfire response scenarios featuring large maps, heterogeneous agents, partial observability, stochastic dynamics, and long-horizon planning objectives. The environment supports both low-level control and high-level natural language interactions through modular Perception and Execution modules. We implement and evaluate several state-of-the-art LLM-based multi-agent Agentic AI frameworks, uncovering significant performance gaps that highlight the unsolved challenges in large-scale coordination, communication, spatial reasoning, and long-horizon planning under uncertainty. By providing more realistic complexity, scalable architecture, and behavioral evaluation metrics, CREW-Wildfire establishes a critical foundation for advancing research in scalable multi-agent Agentic intelligence. All code, environments, data, and baselines will be released to support future research in this emerging domain.

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-driven systems presents a fundamental challenge to Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), often diminishing user agency and failing to account for value pluralism. Current approaches to value alignment, which rely on centralized, top-down definitions, lack the mechanisms for meaningful contestability. This leaves users and communities unable to challenge or shape the values embedded in the systems that govern their digital lives, creating a crisis of legitimacy and trust. This paper introduces Community-Defined AI Value Pluralism (CDAVP), a socio-technical framework that addresses this gap. It reframes the design problem from achieving a single aligned state to infrastructuring a dynamic ecosystem for value deliberation and application. At its core, CDAVP enables diverse, self-organizing communities to define and maintain explicit value profiles - rich, machine-readable representations that can encompass not only preferences but also community-specific rights and duties. These profiles are then contextually activated by the end-user, who retains ultimate control (agency) over which values guide the AI's behavior. AI applications, in turn, are designed to transparently interpret these profiles and moderate conflicts, adhering to a set of non-negotiable, democratically-legitimated meta-rules. The designer's role shifts from crafting static interfaces to becoming an architect of participatory ecosystems. We argue that infrastructuring for pluralism is a necessary pathway toward achieving robust algorithmic accountability and genuinely contestable, human-centric AI.

Abstract: Existing language model benchmarks provide contradictory model rankings, even for benchmarks that aim to capture similar skills. This dilemma of conflicting rankings hampers model selection, clouds model comparisons, and adds confusion to a growing ecosystem of competing models. Recent work attributed ranking disagreement to the phenomenon of training on the test task: As released, different models exhibit a different level of preparation for any given test task. A candidate solution to the problem is train-before-test: Give each model the same benchmark-specific finetuning before evaluation. Our primary contribution is a broad empirical evaluation of train-before-test across 24 benchmarks and 61 models. We show that train-before-test significantly improves ranking agreement consistently across all benchmarks. Whereas rankings have little external validity to start with, they enjoy a significant degree of external validity when applying train-before-test: Model rankings transfer gracefully from one benchmark to the other. Even within the same model family, train-before-test reduces strong ranking disagreement to near-perfect agreement. In addition, train-before-test reduces the model-score matrix to essentially rank one, revealing new insights into the latent factors of benchmark performance. Our work supports the recommendation to make train-before-test a default component of LLM benchmarking.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Embodied AI has led to an increasing demand for large-scale, high-quality real-world data. However, collecting such embodied data remains costly and inefficient. As a result, simulation environments have become a crucial surrogate for training robot policies. Yet, the significant Real2Sim2Real gap remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in terms of physical dynamics and visual appearance. To address this challenge, we propose EmbodieDreamer, a novel framework that reduces the Real2Sim2Real gap from both the physics and appearance perspectives. Specifically, we propose PhysAligner, a differentiable physics module designed to reduce the Real2Sim physical gap. It jointly optimizes robot-specific parameters such as control gains and friction coefficients to better align simulated dynamics with real-world observations. In addition, we introduce VisAligner, which incorporates a conditional video diffusion model to bridge the Sim2Real appearance gap by translating low-fidelity simulated renderings into photorealistic videos conditioned on simulation states, enabling high-fidelity visual transfer. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EmbodieDreamer. The proposed PhysAligner reduces physical parameter estimation error by 3.74% compared to simulated annealing methods while improving optimization speed by 89.91\%. Moreover, training robot policies in the generated photorealistic environment leads to a 29.17% improvement in the average task success rate across real-world tasks after reinforcement learning. Code, model and data will be publicly available.

Abstract: Unified segmentation of 3D point clouds is crucial for scene understanding, but is hindered by its sparse structure, limited annotations, and the challenge of distinguishing fine-grained object classes in complex environments. Existing methods often struggle to capture rich semantic and contextual information due to limited supervision and a lack of diverse multimodal cues, leading to suboptimal differentiation of classes and instances. To address these challenges, we propose VDG-Uni3DSeg, a novel framework that integrates pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) and large language models (LLMs) to enhance 3D segmentation. By leveraging LLM-generated textual descriptions and reference images from the internet, our method incorporates rich multimodal cues, facilitating fine-grained class and instance separation. We further design a Semantic-Visual Contrastive Loss to align point features with multimodal queries and a Spatial Enhanced Module to model scene-wide relationships efficiently. Operating within a closed-set paradigm that utilizes multimodal knowledge generated offline, VDG-Uni3DSeg achieves state-of-the-art results in semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation, offering a scalable and practical solution for 3D understanding. Our code is available at https://github.com/Hanzy1996/VDG-Uni3DSeg.

Abstract: Deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide range of computer vision tasks. However, their performance often degrades significantly when faced with distribution shifts, such as domain or dataset changes. Test-Time Training (TTT) has emerged as an effective method to enhance model robustness by incorporating an auxiliary unsupervised task during training and leveraging it for model updates at test time. In this work, we introduce CTA (Cross-Task Alignment), a novel approach for improving TTT. Unlike existing TTT methods, CTA does not require a specialized model architecture and instead takes inspiration from the success of multi-modal contrastive learning to align a supervised encoder with a self-supervised one. This process enforces alignment between the learned representations of both models, thereby mitigating the risk of gradient interference, preserving the intrinsic robustness of self-supervised learning and enabling more semantically meaningful updates at test-time. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in robustness and generalization over the state-of-the-art on several benchmark datasets.

<title>Action Space Reduction Strategies for Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Driving</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising framework for autonomous driving by enabling agents to learn control policies through interaction with environments. However, large and high-dimensional action spaces often used to support fine-grained control can impede training efficiency and increase exploration costs. In this study, we introduce and evaluate two novel structured action space modification strategies for RL in autonomous driving: dynamic masking and relative action space reduction. These approaches are systematically compared against fixed reduction schemes and full action space baselines to assess their impact on policy learning and performance. Our framework leverages a multimodal Proximal Policy Optimization agent that processes both semantic image sequences and scalar vehicle states. The proposed dynamic and relative strategies incorporate real-time action masking based on context and state transitions, preserving action consistency while eliminating invalid or suboptimal choices. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse driving routes, we show that action space reduction significantly improves training stability and policy performance. The dynamic and relative schemes, in particular, achieve a favorable balance between learning speed, control precision, and generalization. These findings highlight the importance of context-aware action space design for scalable and reliable RL in autonomous driving tasks.

Abstract: Accurate motion prediction of surrounding traffic participants is crucial for the safe and efficient operation of automated vehicles in dynamic environments. Marginal prediction models commonly forecast each agent's future trajectories independently, often leading to sub-optimal planning decisions for an automated vehicle. In contrast, joint prediction models explicitly account for the interactions between agents, yielding socially and physically consistent predictions on a scene level. However, existing approaches differ not only in their problem formulation but also in the model architectures and implementation details used, making it difficult to compare them. In this work, we systematically investigate different approaches to joint motion prediction, including post-processing of the marginal predictions, explicitly training the model for joint predictions, and framing the problem as a generative task. We evaluate each approach in terms of prediction accuracy, multi-modality, and inference efficiency, offering a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and limitations of each approach. Several prediction examples are available at https://frommarginaltojointpred.github.io/.

Abstract: Recent benchmarks for Large Language Model (LLM) agents primarily focus on evaluating reasoning, planning, and execution capabilities, while another critical component-memory, encompassing how agents memorize, update, and retrieve long-term information-is under-evaluated due to the lack of benchmarks. We term agents with memory mechanisms as memory agents. In this paper, we identify four core competencies essential for memory agents: accurate retrieval, test-time learning, long-range understanding, and conflict resolution. Existing datasets either rely on limited context lengths or are tailored for static, long-context settings like book-based QA, which do not reflect the interactive, multi-turn nature of memory agents that incrementally accumulate information. Furthermore, no existing benchmarks cover all four competencies. Therefore, we introduce MemoryAgentBench, a new benchmark specifically designed for memory agents. Our benchmark combines reformulated existing datasets with newly constructed ones, covering the above four memory competencies, providing a systematic and challenging testbed for assessing memory quality. We evaluate a diverse set of memory agents, ranging from simple context-based and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to advanced agents with external memory modules and tool integration. Empirical results reveal that current methods fall short of mastering all four competencies, underscoring the need for further research into comprehensive memory mechanisms for LLM agents.

Abstract: Standard probabilistic models face fundamental challenges such as data scarcity, a large hypothesis space, and poor data transparency. To address these challenges, we propose a novel probabilistic model of data-driven temporal propositional reasoning. Unlike conventional probabilistic models where data is a product of domain knowledge encoded in the probabilistic model, we explore the reverse direction where domain knowledge is a product of data encoded in the probabilistic model. This more data-driven perspective suggests no distinction between maximum likelihood parameter learning and temporal propositional reasoning. We show that our probabilistic model is equivalent to a highest-order, i.e., full-memory, Markov chain, and our model requires no distinction between hidden and observable variables. We discuss that limits provide a natural and mathematically rigorous way to handle data scarcity, including the zero-frequency problem. We also discuss that a probability distribution over data generated by our probabilistic model helps data transparency by revealing influential data used in predictions. The reproducibility of this theoretical work is fully demonstrated by the included proofs.

Abstract: When working with generative artificial intelligence (AI), users may see productivity gains, but the AI-generated content may not match their preferences exactly. To study this effect, we introduce a Bayesian framework in which heterogeneous users choose how much information to share with the AI, facing a trade-off between output fidelity and communication cost. We show that the interplay between these individual-level decisions and AI training may lead to societal challenges. Outputs may become more homogenized, especially when the AI is trained on AI-generated content, potentially triggering a homogenization death spiral. And any AI bias may propagate to become societal bias. A solution to the homogenization and bias issues is to reduce human-AI interaction frictions and enable users to flexibly share information, leading to personalized outputs without sacrificing productivity.

Abstract: Are generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models, trained only to predict the next token, implicitly learning a world model from which sequences are generated one token at a time? We address this question by deriving a causal interpretation of the attention mechanism in GPT and presenting a causal world model that arises from this interpretation. Furthermore, we propose that GPT models, at inference time, can be utilized for zero-shot causal structure learning for input sequences, and introduce a corresponding confidence score. Empirical tests were conducted in controlled environments using the setups of the Othello and Chess strategy games. A GPT, pre-trained on real-world games played with the intention of winning, was tested on out-of-distribution synthetic data consisting of sequences of random legal moves. We find that the GPT model is likely to generate legal next moves for out-of-distribution sequences for which a causal structure is encoded in the attention mechanism with high confidence. In cases where it generates illegal moves, it also fails to capture a causal structure.

Abstract: This paper compares Julia reduction and hyperbolic reduction with the aim of finding equivalent binary forms with minimal coefficients. We demonstrate that hyperbolic reduction generally outperforms Julia reduction, particularly in the cases of sextics and decimics, though neither method guarantees achieving the minimal form. We further propose an additional shift and scaling to approximate the minimal form more closely. Finally, we introduce a machine learning framework to identify optimal transformations that minimize the heights of binary forms. This study provides new insights into the geometry and algebra of binary forms and highlights the potential of AI in advancing symbolic computation and reduction techniques. The findings, supported by extensive computational experiments, lay the groundwork for hybrid approaches that integrate traditional reduction methods with data-driven techniques.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful tool for planning. However, unlike Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-whose performance naturally improves with inference-time computation scaling-standard diffusion-based planners offer only limited avenues for the scalability. In this paper, we introduce Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD), a novel framework that integrates the generative strength of diffusion models with the adaptive search capabilities of MCTS. Our method reconceptualizes denoising as a tree-structured process, allowing partially denoised plans to be iteratively evaluated, pruned, and refined. By selectively expanding promising trajectories while retaining the flexibility to revisit and improve suboptimal branches, MCTD achieves the benefits of MCTS such as controlling exploration-exploitation trade-offs within the diffusion framework. Empirical results on challenging long-horizon tasks show that MCTD outperforms diffusion baselines, yielding higher-quality solutions as inference-time computation increases.

Abstract: Content analysis breaks down complex and unstructured texts into theory-informed numerical categories. Particularly, in social science, this process usually relies on multiple rounds of manual annotation, domain expert discussion, and rule-based refinement. In this paper, we introduce SCALE, a novel multi-agent framework that effectively $\underline{\textbf{S}}$imulates $\underline{\textbf{C}}$ontent $\underline{\textbf{A}}$nalysis via $\underline{\textbf{L}}$arge language model (LLM) ag$\underline{\textbf{E}}$nts. SCALE imitates key phases of content analysis, including text coding, collaborative discussion, and dynamic codebook evolution, capturing the reflective depth and adaptive discussions of human researchers. Furthermore, by integrating diverse modes of human intervention, SCALE is augmented with expert input to further enhance its performance. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that SCALE achieves human-approximated performance across various complex content analysis tasks, offering an innovative potential for future social science research.

Abstract: The current state of modern web interfaces, especially in regards to accessibility focused usage is extremely lacking. Traditional methods for web interaction, such as scripting languages and screen readers, often lack the flexibility to handle dynamic content or the intelligence to interpret high-level user goals. To address these limitations, we introduce WebNav, a novel agent for multi-modal web navigation. WebNav leverages a dual Large Language Model (LLM) architecture to translate natural language commands into precise, executable actions on a graphical user interface. The system combines vision-based context from screenshots with a dynamic DOM-labeling browser extension to robustly identify interactive elements. A high-level 'Controller' LLM strategizes the next step toward a user's goal, while a second 'Assistant' LLM generates the exact parameters for execution. This separation of concerns allows for sophisticated task decomposition and action formulation. Our work presents the complete architecture and implementation of WebNav, demonstrating a promising approach to creating more intelligent web automation agents.

Abstract: In many real-world planning tasks, agents must tackle uncertainty about the environment's state and variability in the outcomes of any chosen policy. We address both forms of uncertainty as a first step toward safer algorithms in partially observable settings. Specifically, we extend Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DistRL)-which models the entire return distribution for fully observable domains-to Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), allowing an agent to learn the distribution of returns for each conditional plan. Concretely, we introduce new distributional Bellman operators for partial observability and prove their convergence under the supremum p-Wasserstein metric. We also propose a finite representation of these return distributions via psi-vectors, generalizing the classical alpha-vectors in POMDP solvers. Building on this, we develop Distributional Point-Based Value Iteration (DPBVI), which integrates psi-vectors into a standard point-based backup procedure-bridging DistRL and POMDP planning. By tracking return distributions, DPBVI naturally enables risk-sensitive control in domains where rare, high-impact events must be carefully managed. We provide source code to foster further research in robust decision-making under partial observability.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel dynamic post-shielding framework that enforces the full class of $\omega$-regular correctness properties over pre-computed probabilistic policies. This constitutes a paradigm shift from the predominant setting of safety-shielding -- i.e., ensuring that nothing bad ever happens -- to a shielding process that additionally enforces liveness -- i.e., ensures that something good eventually happens. At the core, our method uses Strategy-Template-based Adaptive Runtime Shields (STARs), which leverage permissive strategy templates to enable post-shielding with minimal interference. As its main feature, STARs introduce a mechanism to dynamically control interference, allowing a tunable enforcement parameter to balance formal obligations and task-specific behavior at runtime. This allows to trigger more aggressive enforcement when needed, while allowing for optimized policy choices otherwise. In addition, STARs support runtime adaptation to changing specifications or actuator failures, making them especially suited for cyber-physical applications. We evaluate STARs on a mobile robot benchmark to demonstrate their controllable interference when enforcing (incrementally updated) $\omega$-regular correctness properties over learned probabilistic policies.

Abstract: Agriculture is undergoing a major transformation driven by artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and knowledge representation technologies. However, current agricultural intelligence systems often lack contextual understanding, explainability, and adaptability, especially for smallholder farmers with limited resources. General-purpose large language models (LLMs), while powerful, typically lack the domain-specific knowledge and contextual reasoning needed for practical decision support in farming. They tend to produce recommendations that are too generic or unrealistic for real-world applications. To address these challenges, we present OpenAg, a comprehensive framework designed to advance agricultural artificial general intelligence (AGI). OpenAg combines domain-specific foundation models, neural knowledge graphs, multi-agent reasoning, causal explainability, and adaptive transfer learning to deliver context-aware, explainable, and actionable insights. The system includes: (i) a unified agricultural knowledge base that integrates scientific literature, sensor data, and farmer-generated knowledge; (ii) a neural agricultural knowledge graph for structured reasoning and inference; (iii) an adaptive multi-agent reasoning system where AI agents specialize and collaborate across agricultural domains; and (iv) a causal transparency mechanism that ensures AI recommendations are interpretable, scientifically grounded, and aligned with real-world constraints. OpenAg aims to bridge the gap between scientific knowledge and the tacit expertise of experienced farmers to support scalable and locally relevant agricultural decision-making.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful approach for trajectory planning. However, their inherently non-sequential nature limits their effectiveness in long-horizon reasoning tasks at test time. The recently proposed Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) offers a promising solution by combining diffusion with tree-based search, achieving state-of-the-art performance on complex planning problems. Despite its strengths, our analysis shows that MCTD incurs substantial computational overhead due to the sequential nature of tree search and the cost of iterative denoising. To address this, we propose Fast-MCTD, a more efficient variant that preserves the strengths of MCTD while significantly improving its speed and scalability. Fast-MCTD integrates two techniques: Parallel MCTD, which enables parallel rollouts via delayed tree updates and redundancy-aware selection; and Sparse MCTD, which reduces rollout length through trajectory coarsening. Experiments show that Fast-MCTD achieves up to 100x speedup over standard MCTD while maintaining or improving planning performance. Remarkably, it even outperforms Diffuser in inference speed on some tasks, despite Diffuser requiring no search and yielding weaker solutions. These results position Fast-MCTD as a practical and scalable solution for diffusion-based inference-time reasoning.

Abstract: The integration of external knowledge through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become foundational in enhancing large language models (LLMs) for knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing RAG paradigms often overlook the cognitive step of applying knowledge, leaving a gap between retrieved facts and task-specific reasoning. In this work, we introduce RAG+, a principled and modular extension that explicitly incorporates application-aware reasoning into the RAG pipeline. RAG+ constructs a dual corpus consisting of knowledge and aligned application examples, created either manually or automatically, and retrieves both jointly during inference. This design enables LLMs not only to access relevant information but also to apply it within structured, goal-oriented reasoning processes. Experiments across mathematical, legal, and medical domains, conducted on multiple models, demonstrate that RAG+ consistently outperforms standard RAG variants, achieving average improvements of 3-5%, and peak gains up to 7.5% in complex scenarios. By bridging retrieval with actionable application, RAG+ advances a more cognitively grounded framework for knowledge integration, representing a step toward more interpretable and capable LLMs.

Abstract: Failure Analysis (FA) is a highly intricate and knowledge-intensive process. The integration of AI components within the computational infrastructure of FA labs has the potential to automate a variety of tasks, including the detection of non-conformities in images, the retrieval of analogous cases from diverse data sources, and the generation of reports from annotated images. However, as the number of deployed AI models increases, the challenge lies in orchestrating these components into cohesive and efficient workflows that seamlessly integrate with the FA process.
  This paper investigates the design and implementation of a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Planning Agent (LPA) to assist FA engineers in solving their analysis cases. The LPA integrates LLMs with advanced planning capabilities and external tool utilization, enabling autonomous processing of complex queries, retrieval of relevant data from external systems, and generation of human-readable responses. Evaluation results demonstrate the agent's operational effectiveness and reliability in supporting FA tasks.

Abstract: AI agents have experienced a paradigm shift, from early dominance by reinforcement learning (RL) to the rise of agents powered by large language models (LLMs), and now further advancing towards a synergistic fusion of RL and LLM capabilities. This progression has endowed AI agents with increasingly strong abilities. Despite these advances, to accomplish complex real-world tasks, agents are required to plan and execute effectively, maintain reliable memory, and coordinate smoothly with other agents. Achieving these capabilities involves contending with ever-present intricate information, operations, and interactions. In light of this challenge, data structurization can play a promising role by transforming intricate and disorganized data into well-structured forms that agents can more effectively understand and process. In this context, graphs, with their natural advantage in organizing, managing, and harnessing intricate data relationships, present a powerful data paradigm for structurization to support the capabilities demanded by advanced AI agents. To this end, this survey presents a first systematic review of how graphs can empower AI agents. Specifically, we explore the integration of graph techniques with core agent functionalities, highlight notable applications, and identify prospective avenues for future research. By comprehensively surveying this burgeoning intersection, we hope to inspire the development of next-generation AI agents equipped to tackle increasingly sophisticated challenges with graphs. Related resources are collected and continuously updated for the community in the Github link.

Abstract: We introduce jina-embeddings-v4, a 3.8 billion parameter multimodal embedding model that unifies text and image representations through a novel architecture supporting both single-vector and multi-vector embeddings in the late interaction style. The model incorporates task-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters to optimize performance across diverse retrieval scenarios, including query-document retrieval, semantic text similarity, and code search. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that jina-embeddings-v4 achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single-modal and cross-modal retrieval tasks, with particular strength in processing visually rich content such as tables, charts, diagrams, and mixed-media formats. To facilitate evaluation of this capability, we also introduce Jina-VDR, a novel benchmark specifically designed for visually rich image retrieval.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly slow-thinking models, often exhibit severe hallucination, outputting incorrect content due to an inability to accurately recognize knowledge boundaries during reasoning. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) can enhance complex reasoning abilities, its outcome-oriented reward mechanism often lacks factual supervision over the thinking process, further exacerbating the hallucination problem. To address the high hallucination in slow-thinking models, we propose Knowledge-enhanced RL, KnowRL. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. This targeted factual input during RL training enables the model to learn and internalize fact-based reasoning strategies. By directly rewarding adherence to facts within the reasoning steps, KnowRL fosters a more reliable thinking process. Experimental results on three hallucination evaluation datasets and two reasoning evaluation datasets demonstrate that KnowRL effectively mitigates hallucinations in slow-thinking models while maintaining their original strong reasoning capabilities. Our code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowRL.

Abstract: In the recent years, generation of data have escalated to extensive dimensions and big data has emerged as a propelling force in the development of various machine learning advances and internet-of-things (IoT) devices. In this regard, the analytical and learning tools that transport data from several sources to a central cloud for its processing, training, and storage enable realization of the potential of big data. Nevertheless, since the data may contain sensitive information like banking account information, government information, and personal information, these traditional techniques often raise serious privacy concerns. To overcome such challenges, Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a sub-field of machine learning that focuses on scenarios where several entities (commonly termed as clients) work together to train a model while maintaining the decentralisation of their data. Although enormous efforts have been channelized for such studies, there still exists a gap in the literature wherein an extensive review of FL in the realm of big data services remains unexplored. The present paper thus emphasizes on the use of FL in handling big data and related services which encompasses comprehensive review of the potential of FL in big data acquisition, storage, big data analytics and further privacy preservation. Subsequently, the potential of FL in big data applications, such as smart city, smart healthcare, smart transportation, smart grid, and social media are also explored. The paper also highlights various projects pertaining to FL-big data and discusses the associated challenges related to such implementations. This acts as a direction of further research encouraging the development of plausible solutions.

arXiv:2208.13125v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning a predictive model of the mean return, or value function, plays a critical role in many reinforcement learning algorithms. Distributional reinforcement learning (DRL) has been shown to improve performance by modeling the value distribution, not just the mean. We study the value distribution in several continuous control tasks and find that the learned value distribution is empirically quite close to normal. We design a method that exploits this property, employing variances predicted from a variance network, along with returns, to analytically compute target quantile bars representing a normal for our distributional value function. In addition, we propose a policy update strategy based on the correctness as measured by structural characteristics of the value distribution not present in the standard value function. The approach we outline is compatible with many DRL structures. We use two representative on-policy algorithms, PPO and TRPO, as testbeds. Our method yields statistically significant improvements in 10 out of 16 continuous task settings, while utilizing a reduced number of weights and achieving faster training time compared to an ensemble-based method for quantifying value distribution uncertainty.

<title>Relation-Aware Network with Attention-Based Loss for Few-Shot Knowledge Graph Completion</title>

Abstract: Few-shot knowledge graph completion (FKGC) task aims to predict unseen facts of a relation with few-shot reference entity pairs. Current approaches randomly select one negative sample for each reference entity pair to minimize a margin-based ranking loss, which easily leads to a zero-loss problem if the negative sample is far away from the positive sample and then out of the margin. Moreover, the entity should have a different representation under a different context. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel Relation-Aware Network with Attention-Based Loss (RANA) framework. Specifically, to better utilize the plentiful negative samples and alleviate the zero-loss issue, we strategically select relevant negative samples and design an attention-based loss function to further differentiate the importance of each negative sample. The intuition is that negative samples more similar to positive samples will contribute more to the model. Further, we design a dynamic relation-aware entity encoder for learning a context-dependent entity representation. Experiments demonstrate that RANA outperforms the state-of-the-art models on two benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Visual reasoning is essential for building intelligent agents that understand the world and perform problem-solving beyond perception. Differentiable forward reasoning has been developed to integrate reasoning with gradient-based machine learning paradigms. However, due to the memory intensity, most existing approaches do not bring the best of the expressivity of first-order logic, excluding a crucial ability to solve abstract visual reasoning, where agents need to perform reasoning by using analogies on abstract concepts in different scenarios. To overcome this problem, we propose NEUro-symbolic Message-pAssiNg reasoNer (NEUMANN), which is a graph-based differentiable forward reasoner, passing messages in a memory-efficient manner and handling structured programs with functors. Moreover, we propose a computationally-efficient structure learning algorithm to perform explanatory program induction on complex visual scenes. To evaluate, in addition to conventional visual reasoning tasks, we propose a new task, visual reasoning behind-the-scenes, where agents need to learn abstract programs and then answer queries by imagining scenes that are not observed. We empirically demonstrate that NEUMANN solves visual reasoning tasks efficiently, outperforming neural, symbolic, and neuro-symbolic baselines.

Abstract: The challenge of low-latency speech translation has recently draw significant interest in the research community as shown by several publications and shared tasks. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate these different approaches in realistic scenarios. However, currently only specific aspects of the systems are evaluated and often it is not possible to compare different approaches.
  In this work, we propose the first framework to perform and evaluate the various aspects of low-latency speech translation under realistic conditions. The evaluation is carried out in an end-to-end fashion. This includes the segmentation of the audio as well as the run-time of the different components.
  Secondly, we compare different approaches to low-latency speech translation using this framework. We evaluate models with the option to revise the output as well as methods with fixed output. Furthermore, we directly compare state-of-the-art cascaded as well as end-to-end systems. Finally, the framework allows to automatically evaluate the translation quality as well as latency and also provides a web interface to show the low-latency model outputs to the user.

arXiv:2310.07908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can implement complex computations by leveraging a range of dynamics, such as oscillations, attractors, and transient trajectories. A growing body of work has highlighted the emergence of phase codes, a type of oscillatory activity where information is encoded in the relative phase of network activity, in RNNs trained for working memory tasks. However, these studies rely on architectural constraints or regularization schemes that explicitly promote oscillatory solutions. Here, we investigate whether phase coding can emerge purely from task optimization by training continuous-time RNNs to perform a simple modular arithmetic task without oscillatory-promoting biases. We find that in the absence of such biases, RNNs can learn phase code solutions. Surprisingly, we also uncover a rich diversity of alternative solutions that solve our modular arithmetic task via qualitatively distinct dynamics and dynamical mechanisms. We map the solution space for our task and show that the phase code solution occupies a distinct region. These results suggest that phase coding can be a natural but not inevitable outcome of training RNNs on modular arithmetic, and highlight the diversity of solutions RNNs can learn to solve simple tasks.

<title>AVTENet: A Human-Cognition-Inspired Audio-Visual Transformer-Based Ensemble Network for Video Deepfake Detection</title>

Abstract: The recent proliferation of hyper-realistic deepfake videos has drawn attention to the threat of audio and visual forgeries. Most previous studies on detecting artificial intelligence-generated fake videos only utilize visual modality or audio modality. While some methods exploit audio and visual modalities to detect forged videos, they have not been comprehensively evaluated on multimodal datasets of deepfake videos involving acoustic and visual manipulations, and are mostly based on convolutional neural networks with low detection accuracy. Considering that human cognition instinctively integrates multisensory information including audio and visual cues to perceive and interpret content and the success of transformer in various fields, this study introduces the audio-visual transformer-based ensemble network (AVTENet). This innovative framework tackles the complexities of deepfake technology by integrating both acoustic and visual manipulations to enhance the accuracy of video forgery detection. Specifically, the proposed model integrates several purely transformer-based variants that capture video, audio, and audio-visual salient cues to reach a consensus in prediction. For evaluation, we use the recently released benchmark multimodal audio-video FakeAVCeleb dataset. For a detailed analysis, we evaluate AVTENet, its variants, and several existing methods on multiple test sets of the FakeAVCeleb dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms all existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on Testset-I and Testset-II of the FakeAVCeleb dataset. We also compare AVTENet against humans in detecting video forgery. The results show that AVTENet significantly outperforms humans.

Abstract: Revealing the transparency of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has been widely studied to describe the decision mechanisms of network inner structures. In this paper, we propose a novel post-hoc framework, Unfold and Conquer Attribution Guidance (UCAG), which enhances the explainability of the network decision by spatially scrutinizing the input features with respect to the model confidence. Addressing the phenomenon of missing detailed descriptions, UCAG sequentially complies with the confidence of slices of the image, leading to providing an abundant and clear interpretation. Therefore, it is possible to enhance the representation ability of explanation by preserving the detailed descriptions of assistant input features, which are commonly overwhelmed by the main meaningful regions. We conduct numerous evaluations to validate the performance in several metrics: i) deletion and insertion, ii) (energy-based) pointing games, and iii) positive and negative density maps. Experimental results, including qualitative comparisons, demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing methods with the nature of clear and detailed explanations and applicability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous in providing different forms of writing assistance to different writers. However, LLM-powered writing systems often fall short in capturing the nuanced personalization and control needed to effectively support users -- particularly for those who lack experience with prompt engineering. To address these challenges, we introduce GhostWriter, an AI-enhanced design probe that enables users to exercise enhanced agency and personalization during writing. GhostWriter leverages LLMs to implicitly learn the user's intended writing style for seamless personalization, while exposing explicit teaching moments for style refinement and reflection. We study 18 participants who use GhostWriter on two distinct writing tasks, observing that it helps users craft personalized text generations and empowers them by providing multiple ways to control the system's writing style. Based on this study, we present insights on how specific design choices can promote greater user agency in AI-assisted writing and discuss people's evolving relationships with such systems. We conclude by offering design recommendations for future work.

Abstract: Accurate pedestrian intention prediction (PIP) by Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) is one of the current research challenges in this field. In this article, we introduce PIP-Net, a novel framework designed to predict pedestrian crossing intentions by AVs in real-world urban scenarios. We offer two variants of PIP-Net designed for different camera mounts and setups. Leveraging both kinematic data and spatial features from the driving scene, the proposed model employs a recurrent and temporal attention-based solution, outperforming state-of-the-art performance. To enhance the visual representation of road users and their proximity to the ego vehicle, we introduce a categorical depth feature map, combined with a local motion flow feature, providing rich insights into the scene dynamics. Additionally, we explore the impact of expanding the camera's field of view, from one to three cameras surrounding the ego vehicle, leading to an enhancement in the model's contextual perception. Depending on the traffic scenario and road environment, the model excels in predicting pedestrian crossing intentions up to 4 seconds in advance, which is a breakthrough in current research studies in pedestrian intention prediction. Finally, for the first time, we present the Urban-PIP dataset, a customised pedestrian intention prediction dataset, with multi-camera annotations in real-world automated driving scenarios.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement in video generation, people can conveniently use video generation models to create videos tailored to their specific desires. As a result, there are also growing concerns about the potential misuse of video generation for spreading illegal content and misinformation.
  In this work, we introduce VGMShield: a set of straightforward but effective mitigations through the lifecycle of fake video generation. We start from fake video detection, trying to understand whether there is uniqueness in generated videos and whether we can differentiate them from real videos; then, we investigate the fake video source tracing problem, which maps a fake video back to the model that generated it. Towards these, we propose to leverage pre-trained models that focus on spatial-temporal dynamics as the backbone to identify inconsistencies in videos. In detail, we analyze fake videos from the perspective of the generation process. Based on the observation of attention shifts, motion variations, and frequency fluctuations, we identify common patterns in the generated video. These patterns serve as the foundation for our experiments on fake video detection and source tracing.
  Through experiments on seven state-of-the-art open-source models, we demonstrate that current models still cannot reliably reproduce spatial-temporal relationships, and thus, we can accomplish detection and source tracing with over 90% accuracy.
  Furthermore, anticipating future generative model improvements, we propose a prevention method that adds invisible perturbations to the query images to make the generated videos look unreal. Together with detection and tracing, our multi-faceted set of solutions can effectively mitigate misuse of video generative models.

Abstract: Training high-quality deep learning models is a challenging task due to computational and technical requirements. A growing number of individuals, institutions, and companies increasingly rely on pre-trained, third-party models made available in public repositories. These models are often used directly or integrated in product pipelines with no particular precautions, since they are effectively just data in tensor form and considered safe. In this paper, we raise awareness of a new machine learning supply chain threat targeting neural networks. We introduce MaleficNet 2.0, a novel technique to embed self-extracting, self-executing malware in neural networks. MaleficNet 2.0 uses spread-spectrum channel coding combined with error correction techniques to inject malicious payloads in the parameters of deep neural networks. MaleficNet 2.0 injection technique is stealthy, does not degrade the performance of the model, and is robust against removal techniques. We design our approach to work both in traditional and distributed learning settings such as Federated Learning, and demonstrate that it is effective even when a reduced number of bits is used for the model parameters. Finally, we implement a proof-of-concept self-extracting neural network malware using MaleficNet 2.0, demonstrating the practicality of the attack against a widely adopted machine learning framework. Our aim with this work is to raise awareness against these new, dangerous attacks both in the research community and industry, and we hope to encourage further research in mitigation techniques against such threats.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that diffusion models are capable of generating high-quality samples, but their quality heavily depends on sampling guidance techniques, such as classifier guidance (CG) and classifier-free guidance (CFG). These techniques are often not applicable in unconditional generation or in various downstream tasks such as image restoration. In this paper, we propose a novel sampling guidance, called Perturbed-Attention Guidance (PAG), which improves diffusion sample quality across both unconditional and conditional settings, achieving this without requiring additional training or the integration of external modules. PAG is designed to progressively enhance the structure of samples throughout the denoising process. It involves generating intermediate samples with degraded structure by substituting selected self-attention maps in diffusion U-Net with an identity matrix, by considering the self-attention mechanisms' ability to capture structural information, and guiding the denoising process away from these degraded samples. In both ADM and Stable Diffusion, PAG surprisingly improves sample quality in conditional and even unconditional scenarios. Moreover, PAG significantly improves the baseline performance in various downstream tasks where existing guidances such as CG or CFG cannot be fully utilized, including ControlNet with empty prompts and image restoration such as inpainting and deblurring.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) integrates into diverse areas, particularly in content generation, ensuring rightful ownership and ethical use becomes paramount, AI service providers are expected to prioritize responsibly sourcing training data and obtaining licenses from data owners. However, existing studies primarily center on safeguarding static copyrights, which simply treat metadata/datasets as non-fungible items with transferable/trading capabilities, neglecting the dynamic nature of training procedures that can shape an ongoing trajectory. In this paper, we present \textsc{IBis}, a blockchain-based framework tailored for AI model training workflows. Our design can dynamically manage copyright compliance and data provenance in decentralized AI model training processes, ensuring that intellectual property rights are respected throughout iterative model enhancements and licensing updates. Technically, \textsc{IBis} integrates on-chain registries for datasets, licenses and models, alongside off-chain signing services to facilitate collaboration among multiple participants. Further, \textsc{IBis} provides APIs designed for seamless integration with existing contract management software, minimizing disruptions to established model training processes. We implement \textsc{IBis} using Daml on the Canton blockchain. Evaluation results showcase the feasibility and scalability of \textsc{IBis} across varying numbers of users, datasets, models, and licenses.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal forecasting is essential for understanding future dynamics within real-world systems by leveraging historical data from multiple locations. Existing methods often prioritize the development of intricate neural networks to capture the complex dependencies of the data. These methods neglect node-level heterogeneity and face over-parameterization when attempting to model node-specific characteristics. In this paper, we present a novel low-rank adaptation framework for existing spatio-temporal prediction models, termed \model, which alleviates the aforementioned problems through node-level adjustments. Specifically, we introduce the node-adaptive low-rank layer and node-specific predictor, capturing the complex functional characteristics of nodes while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently achieves superior performance across various forecasting models with minimal computational overhead, improving performance by 7% with only 1% additional parameter cost.

Abstract: A graph is a fundamental data model to represent various entities and their complex relationships in society and nature, such as social networks, transportation networks, and financial networks. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have showcased a strong generalization ability to handle various natural language processing tasks to answer users' arbitrary questions and generate specific-domain content. Compared with graph learning models, LLMs enjoy superior advantages in addressing the challenges of generalizing graph tasks by eliminating the need for training graph learning models and reducing the cost of manual annotation. However, LLMs are sequential models for textual data, but graphs are non-sequential topological data. It is challenging to adapt LLMs to tackle graph analytics tasks. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive investigation of existing LLM studies on graph data, which summarizes the relevant graph analytics tasks solved by advanced LLM models and points out the existing challenges and future directions. Specifically, we study the key problems of LLM-based generative graph analytics (LLM-GGA) in terms of three categories: LLM-based graph query processing (LLM-GQP), LLM-based graph inference and learning (LLM-GIL), and graph-LLM-based applications. LLM-GQP focuses on an integration of graph analytics techniques and LLM prompts, including graph understanding and knowledge graphs and LLMs, while LLM-GIL focuses on learning and reasoning over graphs, including graph learning, graph-formed reasoning, and graph representation. We summarize the useful prompts incorporated into LLM to handle different graph downstream tasks. Moreover, we give a summary of LLM model evaluation, benchmark datasets/tasks, and a deep pro and cons analysis of the discussed LLM-GGA models. We also explore open problems and future directions in the research area of LLMs and graph analytics.

<title>Curvature-Aligned Federated Learning (CAFe): Harmonizing Loss Landscapes for Fairness Without Demographics</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative training, making it well-suited for decentralized human-sensing applications. Ensuring fairness in FL is challenging, as current methods rely on sensitive attribute knowledge, which conflicts with FL's privacy principles. Additionally, sensitive attributes in human-sensing data may be unknown or latent. To address this, we introduce Curvature-Aligned Federated Learning (CAFe), a theoretically grounded approach that achieves fairness in FL without requiring sensitive attribute knowledge, a concept termed "Fairness without Demographics" (FWD). CAFe introduces loss-landscape curvature regularization during local training and clients' loss-landscape sharpness-aware aggregation to align curvature both within and across clients, enabling a strong balance between higher fairness and performance. CAFe is especially suitable for real-world human-sensing FL scenarios involving single or multi-user edge devices with unknown or multiple bias factors. We validated CAFe through theoretical and empirical justifications, and comprehensive evaluations using three real-world datasets and a live real-world FL deployment with a heterogeneous testbed of resource-constrained devices. Additionally, we conduct sensitivity analyses on local training data volume, client sampling, communication overhead, resource costs, and runtime performance to demonstrate its feasibility for practical FL edge device deployment.

Abstract: The ability to build and reason about models of the world is essential for situated language understanding. But evaluating world modeling capabilities in modern AI systems -- especially those based on language models -- has proven challenging, in large part because of the difficulty of disentangling conceptual knowledge about the world from knowledge of surface co-occurrence statistics. This paper presents Elements of World Knowledge (EWoK), a framework for evaluating language models' understanding of the conceptual knowledge underlying world modeling. EWoK targets specific concepts from multiple knowledge domains known to be important for world modeling in humans, from social interactions (help, deceive) to spatial relations (left, right). Objects, agents, and locations in the items can be flexibly filled in, enabling easy generation of multiple controlled datasets. We then introduce EWoK-core-1.0, a dataset of 4,374 items covering 11 world knowledge domains. We evaluate 20 open-weights large language models (1.3B--70B parameters) and compare them with human performance. All tested models perform worse than humans, with results varying drastically across domains. Performance on social interactions and social properties was highest and performance on physical relations and spatial relations was lowest. Overall, this dataset highlights simple cases where even large models struggle and presents rich avenues for targeted research on LLM world modeling capabilities.

Abstract: Deep Learning has advanced significantly in medical applications, aiding disease diagnosis in Chest X-ray images. However, expanding model capabilities with new data remains a challenge, which Continual Learning (CL) aims to address. Previous studies have evaluated CL strategies based on classification performance; however, in sensitive domains such as healthcare, it is crucial to assess performance across socially salient groups to detect potential biases. This study examines how bias evolves across tasks using domain-specific fairness metrics and how different CL strategies impact this evolution. Our results show that Learning without Forgetting and Pseudo-Label achieve optimal classification performance, but Pseudo-Label is less biased.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for a myriad of applications, from natural language processing to decision-making support systems. However, as these models become increasingly integrated into societal frameworks, the imperative to ensure they operate within ethical and moral boundaries has never been more critical. This paper introduces a novel benchmark designed to measure and compare the moral reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We present the first comprehensive dataset specifically curated to probe the moral dimensions of LLM outputs, addressing a wide range of ethical dilemmas and scenarios reflective of real-world complexities.
  The main contribution of this work lies in the development of benchmark datasets and metrics for assessing the moral identity of LLMs, which accounts for nuance, contextual sensitivity, and alignment with human ethical standards. Our methodology involves a multi-faceted approach, combining quantitative analysis with qualitative insights from ethics scholars to ensure a thorough evaluation of model performance. By applying our benchmark across several leading LLMs, we uncover significant variations in moral reasoning capabilities of different models. These findings highlight the importance of considering moral reasoning in the development and evaluation of LLMs, as well as the need for ongoing research to address the biases and limitations uncovered in our study. We publicly release the benchmark at https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1k93YZJserYc2CkqP8d4B3M3sgd3kA8W7 and also open-source the code of the project at https://github.com/agiresearch/MoralBench.

<title>Scaling Value Iteration Networks to 5000 Layers for Extreme Long-Term Planning</title>

Abstract: The Value Iteration Network (VIN) is an end-to-end differentiable neural network architecture for planning. It exhibits strong generalization to unseen domains by incorporating a differentiable planning module that operates on a latent Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, VINs struggle to scale to long-term and large-scale planning tasks, such as navigating a 100x100 maze -- a task that typically requires thousands of planning steps to solve. We observe that this deficiency is due to two issues: the representation capacity of the latent MDP and the planning module's depth. We address these by augmenting the latent MDP with a dynamic transition kernel, dramatically improving its representational capacity, and, to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, introduce an "adaptive highway loss" that constructs skip connections to improve gradient flow. We evaluate our method on 2D/3D maze navigation environments, continuous control, and the real-world Lunar rover navigation task. We find that our new method, named Dynamic Transition VIN (DT-VIN), scales to 5000 layers and solves challenging versions of the above tasks. Altogether, we believe that DT-VIN represents a concrete step forward in performing long-term large-scale planning in complex environments.

Abstract: This paper introduces a deep transformer network for estimating the relative 6D pose of a Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with respect to a ship using monocular images. A synthetic dataset of ship images is created and annotated with 2D keypoints of multiple ship parts. A Transformer Neural Network model is trained to detect these keypoints and estimate the 6D pose of each part. The estimates are integrated using Bayesian fusion. The model is tested on synthetic data and in-situ flight experiments, demonstrating robustness and accuracy in various lighting conditions. The position estimation error is approximately 0.8\% and 1.0\% of the distance to the ship for the synthetic data and the flight experiments, respectively. The method has potential applications for ship-based autonomous UAV landing and navigation.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of Large Language Models (LLMs), safeguarding textual content against unauthorized use is crucial. Watermarking offers a vital solution, protecting both - LLM-generated and plain text sources. This paper presents a unified overview of different perspectives behind designing watermarking techniques through a comprehensive survey of the research literature. Our work has two key advantages: (1) We analyze research based on the specific intentions behind different watermarking techniques, evaluation datasets used, and watermarking addition and removal methods to construct a cohesive taxonomy. (2) We highlight the gaps and open challenges in text watermarking to promote research protecting text authorship. This extensive coverage and detailed analysis sets our work apart, outlining the evolving landscape of text watermarking in Language Models.

<title>Is It Really Long Context if All You Need Is Retrieval? Towards Genuinely Difficult Long Context NLP</title>

Abstract: Improvements in language models' capabilities have pushed their applications towards longer contexts, making long-context evaluation and development an active research area. However, many disparate use-cases are grouped together under the umbrella term of "long-context", defined simply by the total length of the model's input, including - for example - Needle-in-a-Haystack tasks, book summarization, and information aggregation. Given their varied difficulty, in this position paper we argue that conflating different tasks by their context length is unproductive. As a community, we require a more precise vocabulary to understand what makes long-context tasks similar or different. We propose to unpack the taxonomy of long-context based on the properties that make them more difficult with longer contexts. We propose two orthogonal axes of difficulty: (I) Diffusion: How hard is it to find the necessary information in the context? (II) Scope: How much necessary information is there to find? We survey the literature on long-context, provide justification for this taxonomy as an informative descriptor, and situate the literature with respect to it. We conclude that the most difficult and interesting settings, whose necessary information is very long and highly diffused within the input, is severely under-explored. By using a descriptive vocabulary and discussing the relevant properties of difficulty in long-context, we can implement more informed research in this area. We call for a careful design of tasks and benchmarks with distinctly long context, taking into account the characteristics that make it qualitatively different from shorter context.

Abstract: Work is fundamental to societal prosperity and mental health, providing financial security, identity, purpose, and social integration. The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has catalysed debate on job displacement. Some argue that many new jobs and industries will emerge to offset the displacement, while others foresee a widespread decoupling of economic productivity from human input threatening jobs on an unprecedented scale. This study explores the conditions under which both may be true and examines the potential for a self-reinforcing cycle of recessionary pressures that would necessitate sustained government intervention to maintain job security and economic stability. A system dynamics model was developed to undertake ex ante analysis of the effect of AI-capital deepening on labour underutilisation and demand in the economy. Results indicate that even a moderate increase in the AI-capital-to-labour ratio could increase labour underutilisation to double its current level, decrease per capita disposable income by 26% (95% interval, 20.6% - 31.8%), and decrease the consumption index by 21% (95% interval, 13.6% - 28.3%) by mid-2050. To prevent a reduction in per capita disposable income due to the estimated increase in underutilization, at least a 10.8-fold increase in the new job creation rate would be necessary. Results demonstrate the feasibility of an AI-capital- to-labour ratio threshold beyond which even high rates of new job creation cannot prevent declines in consumption. The precise threshold will vary across economies, emphasizing the urgent need for empirical research tailored to specific contexts. This study underscores the need for governments, civic organisations, and business to work together to ensure a smooth transition to an AI- dominated economy to safeguard the Mental Wealth of nations.

Abstract: High-speed railway (HSR) communications are pivotal for ensuring rail safety, operations, maintenance, and delivering passenger information services. The high speed of trains creates rapidly time-varying wireless channels, increases the signaling overhead, and reduces the system throughput, making it difficult to meet the growing and stringent needs of HSR applications. In this article, we explore artificial intelligence (AI)-based beam-level and cell-level mobility management suitable for HSR communications. Particularly, we propose a compressed spatial multi-beam measurements scheme via compressive sensing for beam-level mobility management in HSR communications. In comparison to traditional down-sampling spatial beam measurements, this method leads to improved spatial-temporal beam prediction accuracy with the same measurement overhead. Moreover, we propose a novel AI-based proactive handover scheme to predict handover events and reduce radio link failure (RLF) rates in HSR communications. Compared with the traditional event A3-based handover mechanism, the proposed approach significantly reduces the RLF rates which saves 50% beam measurement overhead.

Abstract: In surgical skill assessment, the Objective Structured Assessments of Technical Skills (OSATS) and Global Rating Scale (GRS) are well-established tools for evaluating surgeons during training. These metrics, along with performance feedback, help surgeons improve and reach practice standards. Recent research on the open-source JIGSAWS dataset, which includes both GRS and OSATS labels, has focused on regressing GRS scores from kinematic data, video, or their combination. However, we argue that regressing GRS alone is limiting, as it aggregates OSATS scores and overlooks clinically meaningful variations during a surgical trial. To address this, we developed a weakly-supervised recurrent transformer model that tracks a surgeon's performance throughout a session by mapping hidden states to six OSATS, derived from kinematic data. These OSATS scores are averaged to predict GRS, allowing us to compare our model's performance against state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. We report Spearman's Correlation Coefficients (SCC) demonstrating that our model outperforms SOTA using kinematic data (SCC 0.83-0.88), and matches performance with video-based models. Our model also surpasses SOTA in most tasks for average OSATS predictions (SCC 0.46-0.70) and specific OSATS (SCC 0.56-0.95). The generation of pseudo-labels at the segment level translates quantitative predictions into qualitative feedback, vital for automated surgical skill assessment pipelines. A senior surgeon validated our model's outputs, agreeing with 77\% of the weakly-supervised predictions \(p=0.006\).

<title>Towards Clean-Label Backdoor Attacks in the Physical World</title>

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are shown to be vulnerable to backdoor poisoning attacks, with most research focusing on \textbf{digital triggers} -- special patterns added to test-time inputs to induce targeted misclassification. \textbf{Physical triggers}, natural objects within a physical scene, have emerged as a desirable alternative since they enable real-time backdoor activations without digital manipulation. However, current physical backdoor attacks require poisoned inputs to have incorrect labels, making them easily detectable by human inspection. In this paper, we explore a new paradigm of attacks, \textbf{clean-label physical backdoor attacks (CLPBA)}, via experiments on facial recognition and animal classification tasks. Our study reveals that CLPBA could be a serious threat with the right poisoning algorithm and physical trigger. A key finding is that different from digital backdoor attacks which exploit memorization to plant backdoors in deep nets, CLPBA works by embedding the feature of the trigger distribution (i.e., the distribution of trigger samples) to the poisoned images through the perturbations. We also find that representative defenses cannot defend against CLPBA easily since CLPBA fundamentally breaks the core assumptions behind these defenses. Our study highlights accidental backdoor activations as a limitation of CLPBA, happening when unintended objects or classes cause the model to misclassify as the target class. The code and dataset can be found at https://github.com/21thinh/Clean-Label-Physical-Backdoor-Attacks.

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly used to design reward functions based on human preferences in Reinforcement Learning (RL). We focus on LLM-designed rewards for Restless Multi-Armed Bandits, a framework for allocating limited resources among agents. In applications such as public health, this approach empowers grassroots health workers to tailor automated allocation decisions to community needs. In the presence of multiple agents, altering the reward function based on human preferences can impact subpopulations very differently, leading to complex tradeoffs and a multi-objective resource allocation problem. We are the first to present a principled method termed Social Choice Language Model for dealing with these tradeoffs for LLM-designed rewards for multiagent planners in general and restless bandits in particular. The novel part of our model is a transparent and configurable selection component, called an adjudicator, external to the LLM that controls complex tradeoffs via a user-selected social welfare function. Our experiments demonstrate that our model reliably selects more effective, aligned, and balanced reward functions compared to purely LLM-based approaches.

<title>Evaluating the Impact of Multiple DER Aggregators on Wholesale Energy Markets: A Hybrid Mean Field Approach</title>

arXiv:2409.00107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into wholesale energy markets can greatly enhance grid flexibility, improve market efficiency, and contribute to a more sustainable energy future. As DERs -- such as solar PV panels and energy storage -- proliferate, effective mechanisms are needed to ensure that small prosumers can participate meaningfully in these markets. We study a wholesale market model featuring multiple DER aggregators, each controlling a portfolio of DER resources and bidding into the market on behalf of the DER asset owners. The key of our approach lies in recognizing the repeated nature of market interactions the ability of participants to learn and adapt over time. Specifically, Aggregators repeatedly interact with each other and with other suppliers in the wholesale market, collectively shaping wholesale electricity prices (aka the locational marginal prices (LMPs)). We model this multi-agent interaction using a mean-field game (MFG), which uses market information -- reflecting the average behavior of market participants -- to enable each aggregator to predict long-term LMP trends and make informed decisions. For each aggregator, because they control the DERs within their portfolio under certain contract structures, we employ a mean-field control (MFC) approach (as opposed to a MFG) to learn an optimal policy that maximizes the total rewards of the DERs under their management. We also propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method to help each agent learn optimal strategies within the MFG framework, enhancing their ability to adapt to market conditions and uncertainties. Numerical simulations show that LMPs quickly reach a steady state in the hybrid mean-field approach. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the combination of energy storage and mean-field learning significantly reduces price volatility compared to scenarios without storage.

Our experiments demonstrate that ConversaSynth effectively generates highquality synthetic audio datasets, which can significantly enhance the training and evaluation of models for audio tagging, audio classification, and multi-speaker speech recognition. The results indicate that the synthetic datasets generated by ConversaSynth exhibit substantial diversity and realism, making them suitable for developing robust, adaptable audio-based AI systems.

Abstract: Despite the central role of retrieval in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, much of the existing research on RAG overlooks the well-established field of fair ranking and fails to account for the interests of all stakeholders involved. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic evaluation of RAG systems that integrate fairness-aware rankings, addressing both ranking fairness and attribution fairness, which ensures equitable exposure of the sources cited in the generated content. Our evaluation focuses on measuring item-side fairness, specifically the fair exposure of relevant items retrieved by RAG systems, and investigates how this fairness impacts both the effectiveness of the systems and the attribution of sources in the generated output that users ultimately see. By experimenting with twelve RAG models across seven distinct tasks, we show that incorporating fairness-aware retrieval often maintains or even enhances both ranking quality and generation quality, countering the common belief that fairness compromises system performance. Additionally, we demonstrate that fair retrieval practices lead to more balanced attribution in the final responses, ensuring that the generator fairly cites the sources it relies on. Our findings underscore the importance of item-side fairness in retrieval and generation, laying the foundation for responsible and equitable RAG systems and guiding future research in fair ranking and attribution.

Abstract: Groundwater resources are one of the most relevant elements in the water cycle, therefore developing models to accurately predict them is a pivotal task in the sustainable resource management framework. Deep Learning (DL) models have been revealed to be very effective in hydrology, especially by feeding spatially distributed data (e.g. raster data). In many regions, hydrological measurements are difficult to obtain regularly or periodically in time, and in some cases, the last available data are not up to date. Reversely, weather data, which significantly impacts water resources, are usually more available and with higher quality. More specifically, we have proposed two different DL models to predict the water table depth in the Grana-Maira catchment (Piemonte, IT) using only exogenous weather image time series. To deal with the image time series, both models are made of a first Time Distributed Convolutional Neural Network (TDC) which encodes the image available at each time step into a vectorial representation. The first model, TDC-LSTM uses then a Sequential Module based on an LSTM layer to learn temporal relations and output the predictions. The second model, TDC-UnPWaveNet uses instead a new version of the WaveNet architecture, adapted here to output a sequence shorter and completely shifted in the future with respect to the input one. To this aim, and to deal with the different sequence lengths in the UnPWaveNet, we have designed a new Channel Distributed layer, that acts like a Time Distributed one but on the channel dimension, i.e. applying the same set of operations to each channel of the input. TDC-LSTM and TDC-UnPWaveNet have shown both remarkable results. However, the two models have focused on different learnable information: TDC-LSTM has focused more on lowering the bias, while TDC-UnPWaveNet has focused more on the temporal dynamics, maximizing correlation, and KGE.

Abstract: Transformer neural networks (TNNs) are being applied across a widening range of application domains, including natural language processing (NLP), machine translation, and computer vision (CV). Their popularity is largely attributed to the exceptional performance of their multi-head self-attention blocks when analyzing sequential data and extracting features. To date, there are limited hardware accelerators tailored for this mechanism, which is the first step before designing an accelerator for a complete model. This paper proposes \textit{FAMOUS}, a flexible hardware accelerator for dense multi-head attention (MHA) computation of TNNs on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). It is optimized for high utilization of processing elements and on-chip memories to improve parallelism and reduce latency. An efficient tiling of large matrices has been employed to distribute memory and computing resources across different modules on various FPGA platforms. The design is evaluated on Xilinx Alveo U55C and U200 data center cards containing Ultrascale+ FPGAs. Experimental results are presented that show that it can attain a maximum throughput, number of parallel attention heads, embedding dimension and tile size of 328 (giga operations/second (GOPS)), 8, 768 and 64 respectively on the U55C. Furthermore, it is 3.28$\times$ and 2.6$\times$ faster than the Intel Xeon Gold 5220R CPU and NVIDIA V100 GPU respectively. It is also 1.3$\times$ faster than the fastest state-of-the-art FPGA-based accelerator.

Abstract: In participatory budgeting (PB), voters decide through voting which subset of projects to fund within a given budget. Proportionality in the context of PB is crucial to ensure equal treatment of all groups of voters. However, pure proportional rules can sometimes lead to suboptimal outcomes. We introduce the Method of Equal Shares with Bounded Overspending (BOS Equal Shares), a robust variant of Equal Shares that balances proportionality and efficiency. BOS Equal Shares addresses inefficiencies implied by strict proportionality axioms, yet the rule still provides fairness guarantees, similar to the original Method of Equal Shares. Our extensive empirical analysis on real-world PB instances shows excellent performance of BOS Equal Shares across several metrics. In the course of the analysis, we also present and examine a fractional variant of the Method of Equal Shares which allows for partial funding of projects.

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is an emerging field of research with potential applications to distributed collaborative learning, such as Split Learning (SL). SL allows resource-constrained clients to collaboratively train ML models with a server, reduce their computational overhead, and enable data privacy by avoiding raw data sharing. Although QML with SL has been studied, the problem remains open in resource-constrained environments where clients lack quantum computing capabilities. Additionally, data privacy leakage between client and server in SL poses risks of reconstruction attacks on the server side. To address these issues, we propose Hybrid Quantum Split Learning (HQSL), an application of Hybrid QML in SL. HQSL enables classical clients to train models with a hybrid quantum server and curtails reconstruction attacks. Additionally, we introduce a novel qubit-efficient data-loading technique for designing a quantum layer in HQSL, minimizing both the number of qubits and circuit depth. Evaluations on real hardware demonstrate HQSL's practicality under realistic quantum noise. Experiments on five datasets demonstrate HQSL's feasibility and ability to enhance classification performance compared to its classical models. Notably, HQSL achieves mean improvements of over 3% in both accuracy and F1-score for the Fashion-MNIST dataset, and over 1.5% in both metrics for the Speech Commands dataset. We expand these studies to include up to 100 clients, confirming HQSL's scalability. Moreover, we introduce a noise-based defense mechanism to tackle reconstruction attacks on the server side. Overall, HQSL enables classical clients to train collaboratively with a hybrid quantum server, improving model performance and resistance against reconstruction attacks.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs), augmented reality (AR), and user interface/user experience (UI/UX) design in therapies for children, especially with disorders like autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is studied in detail in this review study. 150 publications were collected by a thorough literature search throughout PubMed, ACM, IEEE Xplore, Elsevier, and Google Scholar; 60 of them were chosen based on their methodological rigor and relevance to the focus area. Three of the primary areas are studied and covered in this review: how AR can improve social and learning results, how LLMs can support communication, and how UI/UX design affects how effective these technologies can be. Results show that while LLMs can provide individualized learning and communication support, AR has shown promise in enhancing social skills, motivation, and attention. For children with ASD, accessible and engaging interventions rely heavily on effective UI/UX design, but there is still a significant lack of robotics-based education and therapeutic programs specifically tailored for autistic children. To optimize the benefits of these technologies in ASD therapies and immersive education, the study emphasizes the need for additional research to address difficulties related to customization, accessibility, and integration.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), recent years have witnessed many promising studies on leveraging LLM-based agents to simulate human social behavior. While prior work has demonstrated significant potential across various domains, much of it has focused on specific scenarios involving a limited number of agents and has lacked the ability to adapt when errors occur during simulation. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel LLM-agent-based simulation platform called \textit{GenSim}, which: (1) \textbf{Abstracts a set of general functions} to simplify the simulation of customized social scenarios; (2) \textbf{Supports one hundred thousand agents} to better simulate large-scale populations in real-world contexts; (3) \textbf{Incorporates error-correction mechanisms} to ensure more reliable and long-term simulations. To evaluate our platform, we assess both the efficiency of large-scale agent simulations and the effectiveness of the error-correction mechanisms. To our knowledge, GenSim represents an initial step toward a general, large-scale, and correctable social simulation platform based on LLM agents, promising to further advance the field of social science.

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) has shown promise in robot locomotion but is often limited to learning a single expert policy, constraining behavior diversity and robustness in unpredictable real-world scenarios. To address this, we introduce Quality Diversity Inverse Reinforcement Learning (QD-IRL), a novel framework that integrates quality-diversity optimization with IRL methods, enabling agents to learn diverse behaviors from limited demonstrations. This work introduces Extrinsic Behavioral Curiosity (EBC), which allows agents to receive additional curiosity rewards from an external critic based on how novel the behaviors are with respect to a large behavioral archive. To validate the effectiveness of EBC in exploring diverse locomotion behaviors, we evaluate our method on multiple robot locomotion tasks. EBC improves the performance of QD-IRL instances with GAIL, VAIL, and DiffAIL across all included environments by up to 185%, 42%, and 150%, even surpassing expert performance by 20% in Humanoid. Furthermore, we demonstrate that EBC is applicable to Gradient-Arborescence-based Quality Diversity Reinforcement Learning (QD-RL) algorithms, where it substantially improves performance and provides a generic technique for diverse robot locomotion.

<title>Reducing the Cost of Dropout in Flash-Attention by Hiding RNG with GEMM</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07531</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2410.07531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dropout, a network operator, when enabled is likely to dramatically impact the performance of Flash-Attention, which in turn increases the end-to-end training time of Large-Language-Models (LLMs). The main contributor to such performance degradation is the Random Number Generation (RNG) phase. The state-of-the-art optimization is to fuse RNG into the Flash-Attention kernel. However, while RNG and Attention do not compete on compute or memory resources, they are bounded on the same lower-level architecture bottlenecks. Fusion can hardly hide RNG latency within the Attention kernel.
  We propose overlapping RNG with previous GEMM layers in the network to hide RNG latency and improve end-to-end performance. RNG and GEMM have distinct resource requirements and hardware bottlenecks, so they can run together without compromising each other's performance. We propose a fine-grained analytical performance model that analyzes low-level architecture resource utilization to evaluate RNG-GEMM overlapping performance benefits. This model, cross-validated by silicon results, shows 1.26x speedup for overlapping RNG and GEMM layers over a sequential implementation on one Transformer Block (one LLM layer including multi-head attention and feed-forward layers), and 1.22x over state-of-the-art fusion implementation, for Llama3 on GH100 GPUs with FP8 precision. Because the kernel patterns are regular, the findings of the shared bottlenecks, as well as the achievable performance benefits, can be generalized to different model architectures, software implementations and hardware configurations.

Abstract: We propose Counterfactual Analysis Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (CAQUBO) to solve QUBO problems for feature selection in recommender systems. CAQUBO leverages counterfactual analysis to measure the impact of individual features and feature combinations on model performance and employs the measurements to construct the coefficient matrix for a quantum annealer to select the optimal feature combinations for recommender systems, thereby improving their final recommendation performance. By establishing explicit connections between features and the recommendation performance, the proposed approach demonstrates superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art quantum annealing methods. Extensive experiments indicate that integrating quantum computing with counterfactual analysis holds great promise for addressing these challenges.

<title>Free-Mask: A Novel Paradigm of Integration Between the Segmentation Diffusion Model and Image Editing</title>

Abstract: Current semantic segmentation models typically require a substantial amount of manually annotated data, a process that is both time-consuming and resource-intensive. Alternatively, leveraging advanced text-to-image models such as Midjourney and Stable Diffusion has emerged as an efficient strategy, enabling the automatic generation of synthetic data in place of manual annotations. However, previous methods have been limited to generating single-instance images, as the generation of multiple instances with Stable Diffusion has proven unstable. To address this limitation and expand the scope and diversity of synthetic datasets, we propose a framework \textbf{Free-Mask} that combines a Diffusion Model for segmentation with advanced image editing capabilities, allowing for the integration of multiple objects into images via text-to-image models. Our method facilitates the creation of highly realistic datasets that closely emulate open-world environments while generating accurate segmentation masks. It reduces the labor associated with manual annotation and also ensures precise mask generation. Experimental results demonstrate that synthetic data generated by \textbf{Free-Mask} enables segmentation models to outperform those trained on real data, especially in zero-shot settings. Notably, \textbf{Free-Mask} achieves new state-of-the-art results on previously unseen classes in the VOC 2012 benchmark.

Abstract: Self-alignment, whereby models learn to improve themselves without human annotation, is a rapidly growing research area. However, existing techniques often fail to improve complex reasoning tasks due to the difficulty of assigning correct rewards. An orthogonal approach that is known to improve correctness is self-consistency, a method applied at inference time based on multiple sampling in order to find the most consistent answer. In this work, we extend the self-consistency concept to help train models. We thus introduce self-consistency preference optimization (ScPO), which iteratively trains consistent answers to be preferred over inconsistent ones on unsupervised new problems. We show ScPO leads to large improvements over conventional reward model training on reasoning tasks such as GSM8K and MATH, closing the gap with supervised training with gold answers or preferences, and that combining ScPO with standard supervised learning improves results even further. On ZebraLogic, ScPO finetunes Llama-3 8B to be superior to Llama-3 70B, Gemma-2 27B, and Claude-3 Haiku.

<title>The Super Weight in Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2411.07191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent works have shown a surprising result: a small fraction of Large Language Model (LLM) parameter outliers are disproportionately important to the quality of the model. LLMs contain billions of parameters, so these small fractions, such as 0.01%, translate to hundreds of thousands of parameters. In this work, we present an even more surprising finding: Pruning as few as a single parameter can destroy an LLM's ability to generate text -- increasing perplexity by 3 orders of magnitude and reducing zero-shot accuracy to guessing. We propose a data-free method for identifying such parameters, termed super weights, using a single forward pass through the model. We additionally find that these super weights induce correspondingly rare and large activation outliers, termed super activations. When preserved with high precision, super activations can improve simple round-to-nearest quantization to become competitive with state-of-the-art methods. For weight quantization, we similarly find that by preserving the super weight and clipping other weight outliers, round-to-nearest quantization can scale to much larger block sizes than previously considered. To facilitate further research into super weights, we provide an index of super weight coordinates for common, openly available LLMs.

<title>CODE-CL: Conceptor-Based Gradient Projection for Deep Continual Learning</title>

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) - the ability to progressively acquire and integrate new concepts - is essential to intelligent systems to adapt to dynamic environments. However, deep neural networks struggle with catastrophic forgetting (CF) when learning tasks sequentially, as training for new tasks often overwrites previously learned knowledge. To address this, recent approaches constrain updates to orthogonal subspaces using gradient projection, effectively preserving important gradient directions for previous tasks. While effective in reducing forgetting, these approaches inadvertently hinder forward knowledge transfer (FWT), particularly when tasks are highly correlated. In this work, we propose Conceptor-based gradient projection for Deep Continual Learning (CODE-CL), a novel method that leverages conceptor matrix representations, a form of regularized reconstruction, to adaptively handle highly correlated tasks. CODE-CL mitigates CF by projecting gradients onto pseudo-orthogonal subspaces of previous task feature spaces while simultaneously promoting FWT. It achieves this by learning a linear combination of shared basis directions, allowing efficient balance between stability and plasticity and transfer of knowledge between overlapping input feature representations. Extensive experiments on continual learning benchmarks validate CODE-CL's efficacy, demonstrating superior performance, reduced forgetting, and improved FWT as compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Using Machine Learning to Discover Parsimonious and Physically-Interpretable Representations of Catchment-Scale Rainfall-Runoff Dynamics</title>

Abstract: Despite excellent real-world predictive performance of modern machine learning (ML) methods, many scientists hesitate to discard traditional physical-conceptual (PC) approaches due to their relative interpretability, which contributes to credibility during decision-making. In this context, a currently underexplored aspect of ML is how to develop minimally-optimal representations that can facilitate better insight regarding system functioning. Regardless of how this is achieved, parsimonious representations seem to better support the advancement of scientific understanding. Our own view is that ML-based modeling should be based in use of computational units that are fundamentally easy to interpret in a physical-conceptual sense.
  This paper continues our exploration of how ML can be exploited in the service of scientific investigation. We use the Mass-Conserving-Perceptron (MCP) as the fundamental computational unit in a generic network architecture to explore important issues related to the use of observational data for constructing models of dynamical systems. We show, in the context of lumped catchment modeling, that physical interpretability and predictive performance can both be achieved using a relatively parsimonious distributed-state multiple-flow-path network with context-dependent gating and information sharing across the nodes, suggesting that MCP-based modeling can play a significant role in application of ML to geoscientific investigation.

Abstract: The advanced processing and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have driven substantial progress in vision-language (VL) understanding tasks. However, while effective for tasks governed by straightforward logic, MLLMs often struggle with reasoning complex, detail-intensive logical structures. To address this limitation, we introduce AgentPS, a novel framework that integrates Agentic Process Supervision into MLLMs by sequentially reasoning over ancillary questions during fine-tuning. AgentPS achieves substantial improvements over baseline MLLMs on both public benchmarks and proprietary datasets. Notably, we show that using MLLM-generated ancillary labels in place of human annotations yields only minimal performance degradation, highlighting the method's scalability. These results establish AgentPS as a scalable and effective solution for complex multimodal classification in large-scale industrial applications.

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition has traditionally been a key task in natural language processing, aiming to identify and extract important terms from unstructured text data. However, a notable challenge for contemporary deep-learning NER models has been identifying discontinuous entities, which are often fragmented within the text. To date, methods to address Discontinuous Named Entity Recognition have not been explored using ensemble learning to the best of our knowledge. Furthermore, the rise of large language models, such as ChatGPT in recent years, has shown significant effectiveness across many NLP tasks. Most existing approaches, however, have primarily utilized ChatGPT as a problem-solving tool rather than exploring its potential as an integrative element within ensemble learning algorithms. In this study, we investigated the integration of ChatGPT as an arbitrator within an ensemble method, aiming to enhance performance on DNER tasks. Our method combines five state-of-the-art NER models with ChatGPT using custom prompt engineering to assess the robustness and generalization capabilities of the ensemble algorithm. We conducted experiments on three benchmark medical datasets, comparing our method against the five SOTA models, individual applications of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and a voting ensemble method. The results indicate that our proposed fusion of ChatGPT with the ensemble learning algorithm outperforms the SOTA results in the CADEC, ShARe13, and ShARe14 datasets, showcasing its potential to enhance NLP applications in the healthcare domain.

Abstract: Despite the considerable progress achieved in the long video generation problem, there is still significant room to improve the consistency of the generated videos, particularly in terms of their smoothness and transitions between scenes. We address these issues to enhance the consistency and coherence of videos generated with either single or multiple prompts. We propose the Time-frequency based temporal Attention Reweighting Algorithm (TiARA), which judiciously edits the attention score matrix based on the Discrete Short-Time Fourier Transform. This method is supported by a frequency-based analysis, ensuring that the edited attention score matrix achieves improved consistency across frames. It represents the first-of-its-kind for frequency-based methods in video diffusion models. For videos generated by multiple prompts, we further uncover key factors such as the alignment of the prompts affecting prompt interpolation quality. Inspired by our analyses, we propose PromptBlend, an advanced prompt interpolation pipeline that systematically aligns the prompts. Extensive experimental results validate the efficacy of our proposed method, demonstrating consistent and substantial improvements over multiple baselines.

Abstract: Remote sensing image change description represents an innovative multimodal task within the realm of remote sensing processing.This task not only facilitates the detection of alterations in surface conditions, but also provides comprehensive descriptions of these changes, thereby improving human interpretability and interactivity.Current deep learning methods typically adopt a three stage framework consisting of feature extraction, feature fusion, and change localization, followed by text generation. Most approaches focus heavily on designing complex network modules but lack solid theoretical guidance, relying instead on extensive empirical experimentation and iterative tuning of network components. This experience-driven design paradigm may lead to overfitting and design bottlenecks, thereby limiting the model's generalizability and adaptability.To address these limitations, this paper proposes a paradigm that shift towards data distribution learning using diffusion models, reinforced by frequency-domain noise filtering, to provide a theoretically motivated and practically effective solution to multimodal remote sensing change description.The proposed method primarily includes a simple multi-scale change detection module, whose output features are subsequently refined by a well-designed diffusion model.Furthermore, we introduce a frequency-guided complex filter module to boost the model performance by managing high-frequency noise throughout the diffusion process. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed method across several datasets for remote sensing change detection and description, showcasing its superior performance compared to existing techniques. The code will be available at \href{https://github.com/sundongwei}{MaskApproxNet}.

Abstract: Selective state-space models (SSMs) are an emerging alternative to the Transformer, offering the unique advantage of parallel training and sequential inference. Although these models have shown promising performance on a variety of tasks, their formal expressiveness and length generalization properties remain underexplored. In this work, we provide insight into the workings of selective SSMs by analyzing their expressiveness and length generalization performance on regular language tasks, i.e., finite-state automaton (FSA) emulation. We address certain limitations of modern SSM-based architectures by introducing the Selective Dense State-Space Model (SD-SSM), the first selective SSM that exhibits perfect length generalization on a set of various regular language tasks using a single layer. It utilizes a dictionary of dense transition matrices, a softmax selection mechanism that creates a convex combination of dictionary matrices at each time step, and a readout consisting of layer normalization followed by a linear map. We then proceed to evaluate variants of diagonal selective SSMs by considering their empirical performance on commutative and non-commutative automata. We explain the experimental results with theoretical considerations. Our code is available at https://github.com/IBM/selective-dense-state-space-model.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with a special class of deep neural networks (DNNs) where the input and the output vectors have the same dimension. Such DNNs are widely used in applications, e.g., autoencoders. The training of such networks can be characterized by their fixed points (FPs). We are concerned with the dependence of the FPs number and their stability on the distribution of randomly initialized DNNs' weight matrices. Specifically, we consider the i.i.d. random weights with heavy and light-tail distributions. Our objectives are twofold. First, the dependence of FPs number and stability of FPs on the type of the distribution tail. Second, the dependence of the number of FPs on the DNNs' architecture. We perform extensive simulations and show that for light tails (e.g., Gaussian), which are typically used for initialization, a single stable FP exists for broad types of architectures. In contrast, for heavy tail distributions (e.g., Cauchy), which typically appear in trained DNNs, a number of FPs emerge. We further observe that these FPs are stable attractors and their basins of attraction partition the domain of input vectors. Finally, we observe an intriguing non-monotone dependence of the number of fixed points $Q(L)$ on the DNNs' depth $L$. The above results were first obtained for untrained DNNs with two types of distributions at initialization and then verified by considering DNNs in which the heavy tail distributions arise in training.

<title>Static Segmentation by Tracking: A Label-Efficient Approach for Fine-Grained Specimen Image Segmentation</title>

arXiv:2501.06749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study image segmentation in the biological domain, particularly trait segmentation from specimen images (e.g., butterfly wing stripes, beetle elytra). This fine-grained task is crucial for understanding the biology of organisms, but it traditionally requires manually annotating segmentation masks for hundreds of images per species, making it highly labor-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a label-efficient approach, Static Segmentation by Tracking (SST), based on a key insight: while specimens of the same species exhibit natural variation, the traits of interest show up consistently. This motivates us to concatenate specimen images into a ``pseudo-video'' and reframe trait segmentation as a tracking problem. Specifically, SST generates masks for unlabeled images by propagating annotated or predicted masks from the ``pseudo-preceding'' images. Built upon recent video segmentation models, such as Segment Anything Model 2, SST achieves high-quality trait segmentation with only one labeled image per species, marking a breakthrough in specimen image analysis. To further enhance segmentation quality, we introduce a cycle-consistent loss for fine-tuning, again requiring only one labeled image. Additionally, we demonstrate the broader potential of SST, including one-shot instance segmentation in natural images and trait-based image retrieval.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing self driving laboratories (SDLs) for materials research, promising unprecedented acceleration of scientific discovery. However, current SDL implementations rely on rigid protocols that fail to capture the adaptability and intuition of expert scientists in dynamic experimental settings. We introduce Artificially Intelligent Lab Assistant (AILA), a framework automating atomic force microscopy through LLM driven agents. Further, we develop AFMBench a comprehensive evaluation suite challenging AI agents across the complete scientific workflow from experimental design to results analysis. We find that state of the art models struggle with basic tasks and coordination scenarios. Notably, Claude 3.5 sonnet performs unexpectedly poorly despite excelling in materials domain question answering (QA) benchmarks, revealing that domain specific QA proficiency does not necessarily translate to effective agentic capabilities. Additionally, we observe that LLMs can deviate from instructions, raising safety alignment concerns for SDL applications. Our ablations reveal that multi agent frameworks outperform single-agent architectures. We also observe significant prompt fragility, where slight modifications in prompt structure cause substantial performance variations in capable models like GPT 4o. Finally, we evaluate AILA's effectiveness in increasingly advanced experiments AFM calibration, feature detection, mechanical property measurement, graphene layer counting, and indenter detection. Our findings underscore the necessity for rigorous benchmarking protocols and prompt engineering strategies before deploying AI laboratory assistants in scientific research environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in table understanding have focused on instruction-tuning large language models (LLMs) for table-related tasks. However, existing research has overlooked the impact of hyperparameter choices, and also lacks a comprehensive evaluation of the out-of-domain table understanding ability and the general capabilities of these table LLMs. In this paper, we evaluate these abilities in existing table LLMs, and find significant declines in both out-of-domain table understanding and general capabilities as compared to their base models. Through systematic analysis, we show that hyperparameters, such as learning rate, can significantly influence both table-specific and general capabilities. Contrary to the previous table instruction-tuning work, we demonstrate that smaller learning rates and fewer training instances can enhance table understanding while preserving general capabilities. Based on our findings, we introduce TAMA, a TAble LLM instruction-tuned from LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct, which achieves performance on par with, or surpassing GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on table tasks, while maintaining strong out-of-domain generalization and general capabilities. Our findings highlight the potential for reduced data annotation costs and more efficient model development through careful hyperparameter selection. We open-source the project and our models.

Abstract: Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) has demonstrated remarkable capabilities for task specific fine-tuning. However, in scenarios that involve multiple tasks, training a separate LoRA model for each one results in considerable inefficiency in terms of storage and inference. Moreover, existing parameter generation methods fail to capture the correlations among these tasks, making multi-task LoRA parameter generation challenging. To address these limitations, we propose In-Context Meta LoRA (ICM-LoRA), a novel approach that efficiently achieves task-specific customization of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we use training data from all tasks to train a tailored generator, Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE). CVAE takes task descriptions as inputs and produces task-aware LoRA weights as outputs. These LoRA weights are then merged with LLMs to create task-specialized models without the need for additional fine-tuning. Furthermore, we utilize in-context meta-learning for knowledge enhancement and task mapping, to capture the relationship between tasks and parameter distributions. As a result, our method achieves more accurate LoRA parameter generation for diverse tasks using CVAE. ICM-LoRA enables more accurate LoRA parameter reconstruction than current parameter reconstruction methods and is useful for implementing task-specific enhancements of LoRA parameters. At the same time, our method occupies 283MB, only 1\% storage compared with the original LoRA.

Abstract: Importance: Emergency department (ED) returns for mental health conditions pose a major healthcare burden, with 24-27% of patients returning within 30 days. Traditional machine learning models for predicting these returns often lack interpretability for clinical use.
  Objective: To assess whether integrating large language models (LLMs) with machine learning improves predictive accuracy and clinical interpretability of ED mental health return risk models.
  Methods: This retrospective cohort study analyzed 42,464 ED visits for 27,904 unique mental health patients at an academic medical center in the Deep South from January 2018 to December 2022.
  Main Outcomes and Measures: Two primary outcomes were evaluated: (1) 30-day ED return prediction accuracy and (2) model interpretability using a novel LLM-enhanced framework integrating SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values with clinical knowledge.
  Results: For chief complaint classification, LLaMA 3 (8B) with 10-shot learning outperformed traditional models (accuracy: 0.882, F1-score: 0.86). In SDoH classification, LLM-based models achieved 0.95 accuracy and 0.96 F1-score, with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Substance Abuse performing best (F1: 0.96-0.89), while Exercise and Home Environment showed lower performance (F1: 0.70-0.67). The LLM-based interpretability framework achieved 99% accuracy in translating model predictions into clinically relevant explanations. LLM-extracted features improved XGBoost AUC from 0.74 to 0.76 and AUC-PR from 0.58 to 0.61.
  Conclusions and Relevance: Integrating LLMs with machine learning models yielded modest but consistent accuracy gains while significantly enhancing interpretability through automated, clinically relevant explanations. This approach provides a framework for translating predictive analytics into actionable clinical insights.

<title>An Efficient Local Search Approach for Polarized Community Discovery in Signed Networks</title>

arXiv:2502.02197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Signed networks, where edges are labeled as positive or negative to represent friendly or antagonistic interactions, offer a natural framework for analyzing polarization, trust, and conflict in social systems. Detecting meaningful group structures in such networks is crucial for understanding online discourse, political divisions, and trust dynamics. A key challenge is to identify communities that are internally cohesive and externally antagonistic, while allowing for neutral or unaligned vertices. In this paper, we propose a method for identifying $k$ polarized communities that addresses a major limitation of prior methods: their tendency to produce highly size-imbalanced solutions. We introduce a novel optimization objective that avoids such imbalance. In addition, it is well known that approximation algorithms based on local search are highly effective for clustering signed networks when neutral vertices are not allowed. We build on this idea and design the first local search algorithm that extends to the setting with neutral vertices while scaling to large networks. By connecting our approach to block-coordinate Frank-Wolfe optimization, we prove a linear convergence rate, enabled by the structure of our objective. Experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in solution quality, while remaining competitive in computational efficiency.

Abstract: Many reasoning, planning, and problem-solving tasks share an intrinsic algorithmic nature: correctly simulating each step is a sufficient condition to solve them correctly. We collect pairs of naturalistic and synthetic reasoning tasks to assess the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM). While naturalistic tasks often require careful human handcrafting, we show that synthetic data is, in many cases, a good proxy that is much easier to collect at scale. We leverage common constructs in programming as the counterpart of the building blocks of naturalistic reasoning tasks, such as straight-line programs, code that contains critical paths, and approximate and redundant instructions. We further assess the capabilities of LLMs on sorting problems and repeated operations via sorting algorithms and nested loops. Our synthetic datasets further reveal that while the most powerful LLMs exhibit relatively strong execution capabilities, the process is fragile: it is negatively affected by memorisation and seems to rely heavily on pattern recognition. Our contribution builds upon synthetically testing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs as a scalable complement to handcrafted human-annotated problems.

<title>UniForm: A Unified Multi-Task Diffusion Transformer for Audio-Video Generation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2502.03897v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rise of diffusion models, audio-video generation has been revolutionized. However, most existing methods rely on separate modules for each modality, with limited exploration of unified generative architectures. In addition, many are confined to a single task and small-scale datasets. To overcome these limitations, we introduce UniForm, a unified multi-task diffusion transformer that generates both audio and visual modalities in a shared latent space. By using a unified denoising network, UniForm captures the inherent correlations between sound and vision. Additionally, we propose task-specific noise schemes and task tokens, enabling the model to support multiple tasks with a single set of parameters, including video-to-audio, audio-to-video and text-to-audio-video generation. Furthermore, by leveraging large language models and a large-scale text-audio-video combined dataset, UniForm achieves greater generative diversity than prior approaches. Experiments show that UniForm achieves performance close to the state-of-the-art single-task models across three generation tasks, with generated content that is not only highly aligned with real-world data distributions but also enables more diverse and fine-grained generation.

Abstract: Federated Continual Learning (FCL) has emerged as a robust solution for collaborative model training in dynamic environments, where data samples are continuously generated and distributed across multiple devices. This survey provides a comprehensive review of FCL, focusing on key challenges such as heterogeneity, model stability, communication overhead, and privacy preservation. We explore various forms of heterogeneity and their impact on model performance. Solutions to non-IID data, resource-constrained platforms, and personalized learning are reviewed in an effort to show the complexities of handling heterogeneous data distributions. Next, we review techniques for ensuring model stability and avoiding catastrophic forgetting, which are critical in non-stationary environments. Privacy-preserving techniques are another aspect of FCL that have been reviewed in this work. This survey has integrated insights from federated learning and continual learning to present strategies for improving the efficacy and scalability of FCL systems, making it applicable to a wide range of real-world scenarios.

arXiv:2502.11273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rideshare workers experience unpredictable working conditions due to gig work platforms' reliance on opaque AI and algorithmic systems. In response to these challenges, we found that labor organizers want data to help them advocate for legislation to increase the transparency and accountability of these platforms. To address this need, we collaborated with a Colorado-based rideshare union to develop FairFare, a tool that crowdsources and analyzes workers' data to estimate the take rate -- the percentage of the rider price retained by the rideshare platform. We deployed FairFare with our partner organization that collaborated with us in collecting data on 76,000+ trips from 45 drivers over 18 months. During evaluation interviews, organizers reported that FairFare helped influence the bill language and passage of Colorado Senate Bill 24-75, calling for greater transparency and data disclosure of platform operations, and create a national narrative. Finally, we reflect on complexities of translating quantitative data into policy outcomes, nature of community based audits, and design implications for future transparency tools.

<title>Do LLMs Understand the Safety of Their Inputs? Training-Free Moderation via Latent Prototypes</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16174</link>

arXiv:2502.16174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rise of LLMs, ensuring model safety and alignment has become a critical concern. While modern instruction-finetuned LLMs incorporate alignment during training, they still frequently require moderation tools to prevent unsafe behavior. The most common approach to moderation are guard models that flag unsafe inputs. However, guards require costly training and are typically limited to fixed-size, pre-trained options, making them difficult to adapt to evolving risks and resource constraints. We hypothesize that instruction-finetuned LLMs already encode safety-relevant information internally and explore training-free safety assessment methods that work with off-the-shelf models. We show that simple prompting allows models to recognize harmful inputs they would otherwise mishandle. We also demonstrate that safe and unsafe prompts are distinctly separable in the models' latent space. Building on this, we introduce the Latent Prototype Moderator (LPM), a training-free moderation method that uses Mahalanobis distance in latent space to assess input safety. LPM is a lightweight, customizable add-on that generalizes across model families and sizes. Our method matches or exceeds state-of-the-art guard models across multiple safety benchmarks, offering a practical and flexible solution for scalable LLM moderation.

arXiv:2502.17751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for graded neural networks (GNNs) built over graded vector spaces $\V_\w^n$, extending classical neural architectures by incorporating algebraic grading. Leveraging a coordinate-wise grading structure with scalar action $\lambda \star \x = (\lambda^{q_i} x_i)$, defined by a tuple $\w = (q_0, \ldots, q_{n-1})$, we introduce graded neurons, layers, activation functions, and loss functions that adapt to feature significance. Theoretical properties of graded spaces are established, followed by a comprehensive GNN design, addressing computational challenges like numerical stability and gradient scaling. Potential applications span machine learning and photonic systems, exemplified by high-speed laser-based implementations. This work offers a foundational step toward graded computation, unifying mathematical rigor with practical potential, with avenues for future empirical and hardware exploration.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of deep learning, attention mechanisms have become indispensable in electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis, significantly enhancing Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications. This paper presents a comprehensive review of traditional and Transformer-based attention mechanisms, their embedding strategies, and their applications in EEG-based BCI, with a particular emphasis on multimodal data fusion. By capturing EEG variations across time, frequency, and spatial channels, attention mechanisms improve feature extraction, representation learning, and model robustness. These methods can be broadly categorized into traditional attention mechanisms, which typically integrate with convolutional and recurrent networks, and Transformer-based multi-head self-attention, which excels in capturing long-range dependencies. Beyond single-modality analysis, attention mechanisms also enhance multimodal EEG applications, facilitating effective fusion between EEG and other physiological or sensory data. Finally, we discuss existing challenges and emerging trends in attention-based EEG modeling, highlighting future directions for advancing BCI technology. This review aims to provide valuable insights for researchers seeking to leverage attention mechanisms for improved EEG interpretation and application.

Abstract: Collecting ground-truth rewards or human demonstrations for multi-step reasoning tasks is often prohibitively expensive and time consuming, especially in interactive domains like web tasks. To address this bottleneck, we present self-taught lookahead (STL), a self-supervised method that leverages state-transition dynamics to improve a value model capable of effectively guiding language model-controlled search without any labeled data. We find that moderately sized (8 billion parameters) open-weight value models improved with STL can match the performance of using a gpt-4o value model. Furthermore, we find that specialized value models learned with STL can be deployed with computationally lightweight search algorithms, achieving performance that matches that of more expensive tree search methods, while reducing costs by an order of magnitude.

arXiv:2503.09066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial manipulations such as jailbreaking via prompt injection attacks. These attacks bypass safety mechanisms to generate restricted or harmful content. In this study, we investigated the underlying latent subspaces of safe and jailbroken states by extracting hidden activations from a LLM. Inspired by attractor dynamics in neuroscience, we hypothesized that LLM activations settle into semi stable states that can be identified and perturbed to induce state transitions. Using dimensionality reduction techniques, we projected activations from safe and jailbroken responses to reveal latent subspaces in lower dimensional spaces. We then derived a perturbation vector that when applied to safe representations, shifted the model towards a jailbreak state. Our results demonstrate that this causal intervention results in statistically significant jailbreak responses in a subset of prompts. Next, we probed how these perturbations propagate through the model's layers, testing whether the induced state change remains localized or cascades throughout the network. Our findings indicate that targeted perturbations induced distinct shifts in activations and model responses. Our approach paves the way for potential proactive defenses, shifting from traditional guardrail based methods to preemptive, model agnostic techniques that neutralize adversarial states at the representation level.

Abstract: High-quality data plays a critical role in the pretraining and fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs), even determining their performance ceiling to some degree. Consequently, numerous data selection methods have been proposed to identify subsets of data that can effectively and efficiently enhance model performance. However, most of these methods focus on general data selection and tend to overlook the specific nuances of domain-related data. In this paper, we introduce MASS, a \textbf{MA}thematical data \textbf{S}election framework using the \textbf{S}kill graph for pretraining LLMs in the mathematical reasoning domain. By taking into account the unique characteristics of mathematics and reasoning, we construct a skill graph that captures the mathematical skills and their interrelations from a reference dataset. This skill graph guides us in assigning quality scores to the target dataset, enabling us to select the top-ranked subset which is further used to pretrain LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of MASS across different model sizes (1B and 7B) and pretraining datasets (web data and synthetic data). Specifically, in terms of efficiency, models trained on subsets selected by MASS can achieve similar performance to models trained on the original datasets, with a significant reduction in the number of trained tokens - ranging from 50\% to 70\% fewer tokens. In terms of effectiveness, when trained on the same amount of tokens, models trained on the data selected by MASS outperform those trained on the original datasets by 3.3\% to 5.9\%. These results underscore the potential of MASS to improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of pretraining LLMs.

Abstract: Token-based video representation has emerged as a promising approach for enabling large language models (LLMs) to interpret video content. However, existing token reduction techniques, such as pruning and merging, often disrupt essential positional embeddings and rely on continuous visual tokens sampled from nearby pixels with similar spatial-temporal locations. By removing only a small fraction of tokens, these methods still produce relatively lengthy continuous sequences, which falls short of the extreme compression required to balance computational efficiency and token count in video LLMs. In this paper, we introduce the novel task of Extreme Short Token Reduction, which aims to represent entire videos using a minimal set of discrete tokens. We propose VQToken, a neural discrete token representation framework that (i) applies adaptive vector quantization to continuous ViT embeddings to learn a compact codebook and (ii) preserves spatial-temporal positions via a token hash function by assigning each grid-level token to its nearest codebook entry. On the Extreme Short Token Reduction task, our VQToken compresses sequences to just 0.07 percent of their original length while incurring only a 0.66 percent drop in accuracy on the NextQA-MC benchmark. It also achieves comparable performance on ActNet-QA, Long Video Bench, and VideoMME. We further introduce the Token Information Density (TokDense) metric and formalize fixed-length and adaptive-length subtasks, achieving state-of-the-art results in both settings. Our approach dramatically lowers theoretical complexity, increases information density, drastically reduces token counts, and enables efficient video LLMs in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Video large language models (ViLLMs) excel in general video understanding, e.g., recognizing activities like talking and eating, but struggle with identity-aware comprehension, such as "Wilson is receiving chemotherapy" or "Tom is discussing with Sarah", limiting their applicability in smart healthcare and smart home environments. To address this limitation, we propose a one-shot learning framework PVChat, the first personalized ViLLM that enables subject-aware question answering (QA) from a single video for each subject. Our approach optimizes a Mixture-of-Heads (MoH) enhanced ViLLM on a synthetically augmented video-QA dataset, leveraging a progressive image-to-video learning strategy. Specifically, we introduce an automated augmentation pipeline that synthesizes identity-preserving positive samples and retrieves hard negatives from existing video corpora, generating a diverse training dataset with four QA types: existence, appearance, action, and location inquiries. To enhance subject-specific learning, we propose a ReLU Routing MoH attention mechanism, alongside two novel objectives: (1) Smooth Proximity Regularization for progressive learning through exponential distance scaling and (2) Head Activation Enhancement for balanced attention routing. Finally, we adopt a two-stage training strategy, transitioning from image pre-training to video fine-tuning, enabling a gradual learning process from static attributes to dynamic representations. We evaluate PVChat on diverse datasets covering medical scenarios, TV series, anime, and real-world footage, demonstrating its superiority in personalized feature understanding after learning from a single video, compared to state-of-the-art ViLLMs.

Abstract: Construction Grammar hypothesizes that knowledge of a language consists chiefly of knowledge of form-meaning pairs (''constructions'') that include vocabulary, general grammar rules, and even idiosyncratic patterns. Recent work has shown that transformer language models represent at least some constructional patterns, including ones where the construction is rare overall. In this work, we probe BERT's representation of the form and meaning of a minor construction of English, the NPN (noun-preposition-noun) construction -- exhibited in such expressions as face to face and day to day -- which is known to be polysemous. We construct a benchmark dataset of semantically annotated corpus instances (including distractors that superficially resemble the construction). With this dataset, we train and evaluate probing classifiers. They achieve decent discrimination of the construction from distractors, as well as sense disambiguation among true instances of the construction, revealing that BERT embeddings carry indications of the construction's semantics. Moreover, artificially permuting the word order of true construction instances causes them to be rejected, indicating sensitivity to matters of form. We conclude that BERT does latently encode at least some knowledge of the NPN construction going beyond a surface syntactic pattern and lexical cues.

Abstract: Microfluidic Live-Cell Imaging (MLCI) yields data on microbial cell factories. However, continuous acquisition is challenging as high-throughput experiments often lack real-time insights, delaying responses to stochastic events. We introduce three components in the Experiment Automation Pipeline for Event-Driven Microscopy to Smart Microfluidic Single-Cell Analysis (EAP4EMSIG): a fast, accurate Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)-based autofocusing method predicting the focus offset, an evaluation of real-time segmentation methods and a real-time data analysis dashboard. Our MLP-based autofocusing achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.105 $\mu$m with inference times from 87 ms. Among eleven evaluated Deep Learning (DL) segmentation methods, Cellpose reached a Panoptic Quality (PQ) of 93.36 %, while a distance-based method was fastest (121 ms, Panoptic Quality 93.02 %).

Abstract: Effective conversational agents like large language models (LLMs) must personalize their interactions to adapt to user preferences, personalities, and attributes across diverse domains like education and healthcare. Current methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), often prioritize helpfulness and safety but fall short in fostering truly empathetic, adaptive, and personalized dialogues. Existing personalization approaches typically rely on extensive user history, limiting their effectiveness for new or context-limited users. To address these limitations, we propose leveraging a user model to incorporate a curiosity-based intrinsic reward into multi-turn RLHF. This novel reward mechanism encourages the LLM agent to actively infer user traits by optimizing conversations to improve its user model's accuracy. Consequently, the agent delivers more personalized interactions by learning more about the user. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness in two distinct domains: significantly improving personalization performance in a conversational recommendation task, and personalizing conversations for different learning styles in an educational setting. We show improved generalization capabilities compared to traditional multi-turn RLHF, all while maintaining conversation quality. Our method offers a promising solution for creating more personalized, adaptive, and engaging conversational agents.

<title>Quantifying Robustness: A Benchmarking Framework for Deep Learning Forecasting in Cyber-Physical Systems</title>

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) in domains such as manufacturing and energy distribution generate complex time series data crucial for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). While Deep Learning (DL) methods have demonstrated strong forecasting capabilities, their adoption in industrial CPS remains limited due insufficient robustness. Existing robustness evaluations primarily focus on formal verification or adversarial perturbations, inadequately representing the complexities encountered in real-world CPS scenarios. To address this, we introduce a practical robustness definition grounded in distributional robustness, explicitly tailored to industrial CPS, and propose a systematic framework for robustness evaluation. Our framework simulates realistic disturbances, such as sensor drift, noise and irregular sampling, enabling thorough robustness analyses of forecasting models on real-world CPS datasets. The robustness definition provides a standardized score to quantify and compare model performance across diverse datasets, assisting in informed model selection and architecture design. Through extensive empirical studies evaluating prominent DL architectures (including recurrent, convolutional, attention-based, modular, and structured state-space models) we demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of our approach. We publicly release our robustness benchmark to encourage further research and reproducibility.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to carefully crafted perturbations. In this study, we seek to pinpoint the sources of this fragility by identifying parameters and input dimensions (pixels or token embeddings) that are susceptible to such perturbations. To this end, we propose a stability measure called \textbf{FI}, \textbf{F}irst order local \textbf{I}nfluence, which is rooted in information geometry and quantifies the sensitivity of individual parameter and input dimensions. Our extensive analysis across LLMs and VLMs (from 1.5B to 13B parameters) reveals that: (I) A small subset of parameters or input dimensions with high FI values disproportionately contribute to model brittleness. (II) Mitigating the influence of these vulnerable parameters during model merging leads to improved performance.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about cultural bias, fairness, and their applicability in diverse linguistic and underrepresented regional contexts. To enhance and benchmark the capabilities of LLMs, there is a need to develop large-scale resources focused on multilingual, local, and cultural contexts. In this study, we propose the NativQA framework, which can seamlessly construct large-scale, culturally and regionally aligned QA datasets in native languages. The framework utilizes user-defined seed queries and leverages search engines to collect location-specific, everyday information. It has been evaluated across 39 locations in 24 countries and in 7 languages -- ranging from extremely low-resource to high-resource languages -- resulting in over 300K Question-Answer (QA) pairs. The developed resources can be used for LLM benchmarking and further fine-tuning. The framework has been made publicly available for the community (https://gitlab.com/nativqa/nativqa-framework).

Abstract: We present TerraMind, the first any-to-any generative, multimodal foundation model for Earth observation (EO). Unlike other multimodal models, TerraMind is pretrained on dual-scale representations combining both token-level and pixel-level data across modalities. On a token level, TerraMind encodes high-level contextual information to learn cross-modal relationships, while on a pixel level, TerraMind leverages fine-grained representations to capture critical spatial nuances. We pretrained TerraMind on nine geospatial modalities of a global, large-scale dataset. In this paper, we demonstrate that (i) TerraMind's dual-scale early fusion approach unlocks a range of zero-shot and few-shot applications for Earth observation, (ii) TerraMind introduces "Thinking-in-Modalities" (TiM) -- the capability of generating additional artificial data during finetuning and inference to improve the model output -- and (iii) TerraMind achieves beyond state-of-the-art performance in community-standard benchmarks for EO like PANGAEA. The pretraining dataset, the model weights, and our code are open-sourced under a permissive license.

<title>Towards Explainable Fusion and Balanced Learning in Multimodal Sentiment Analysis</title>

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) faces two critical challenges: the lack of interpretability in the decision logic of multimodal fusion and modality imbalance caused by disparities in inter-modal information density. To address these issues, we propose KAN-MCP, a novel framework that integrates the interpretability of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with the robustness of the Multimodal Clean Pareto (MCPareto) framework. First, KAN leverages its univariate function decomposition to achieve transparent analysis of cross-modal interactions. This structural design allows direct inspection of feature transformations without relying on external interpretation tools, thereby ensuring both high expressiveness and interpretability. Second, the proposed MCPareto enhances robustness by addressing modality imbalance and noise interference. Specifically, we introduce the Dimensionality Reduction and Denoising Modal Information Bottleneck (DRD-MIB) method, which jointly denoises and reduces feature dimensionality. This approach provides KAN with discriminative low-dimensional inputs to reduce the modeling complexity of KAN while preserving critical sentiment-related information. Furthermore, MCPareto dynamically balances gradient contributions across modalities using the purified features output by DRD-MIB, ensuring lossless transmission of auxiliary signals and effectively alleviating modality imbalance. This synergy of interpretability and robustness not only achieves superior performance on benchmark datasets such as CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS v2 but also offers an intuitive visualization interface through KAN's interpretable architecture. Our code is released on https://github.com/LuoMSen/KAN-MCP.

<title>AI for the Open-World: the Learning Principles</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14751</link>

arXiv:2504.14751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During the past decades, numerous successes of AI has been made on "specific capabilities", named closed-world, such as artificial environments or specific real-world tasks. This well-defined narrow capability brings two nice benefits, a clear criterion of success and the opportunity to collect a lot of examples. The criteria not only reveal whether a machine has achieved a goal, but reveal how the machine falls short of the goal. As a result, human designers can fix the problems one after the other until the machine is deemed good enough for the task. Furthermore, the large set of collected examples reduces the difficulty of this problem-fixing process (by the central limit theorem).
  Do the success in closed-world translate into broad open-world, where a machine is required to perform any task that a human could possibly undertake with fewer examples and less priori knowledge from human designers? No. Because competence in a specific task provides little insight in handling other tasks, the valuable criteria for specific tasks become helpless when handling broader unseen tasks. Furthermore, due to the shortage of examples in unseen tasks, central limit theorem does not stand on our side. At the end, human designers lose the oscilloscope to "hack" an AI system for the open-world.
  Achieving AI for the open-world requires unique learning principles and innovated techniques, which are different from the ones in building AI for the closed-world. This thesis explores necessary learning principles required to construct AI for the open-world, including rich features (analogy a large tool box), disentangled representation (an organized tool box), and inference-time learning (a tool-savvy hand). Driven by the learning principles, this thesis further proposes techniques to use the learning principles, conducts enormous large-scale experiments to verify the learning principles.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce EasyEdit2, a framework designed to enable plug-and-play adjustability for controlling Large Language Model (LLM) behaviors. EasyEdit2 supports a wide range of test-time interventions, including safety, sentiment, personality, reasoning patterns, factuality, and language features. Unlike its predecessor, EasyEdit2 features a new architecture specifically designed for seamless model steering. It comprises key modules such as the steering vector generator and the steering vector applier, which enable automatic generation and application of steering vectors to influence the model's behavior without modifying its parameters. One of the main advantages of EasyEdit2 is its ease of use-users do not need extensive technical knowledge. With just a single example, they can effectively guide and adjust the model's responses, making precise control both accessible and efficient. Empirically, we report model steering performance across different LLMs, demonstrating the effectiveness of these techniques. We have released the source code on GitHub at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit along with a demonstration notebook. In addition, we provide a demo video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkfoiPfp5rQ for a quick introduction.

<title>The Role of Open-Source LLMs in Shaping the Future of GeoAI</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI), offering new capabilities in data processing, spatial analysis, and decision support. This paper examines the open-source paradigm's critical role in this transformation. While proprietary LLMs offer accessibility, they often limit the customization, interoperability, and transparency vital for specialized geospatial tasks. Conversely, open-source alternatives significantly advance Geographic Information Science (GIScience) by fostering greater adaptability, reproducibility, and community-driven innovation. Open frameworks empower researchers to tailor solutions, integrate cutting-edge methodologies (e.g., reinforcement learning, advanced spatial indexing), and align with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles. However, the growing reliance on any LLM necessitates careful consideration of security vulnerabilities, ethical risks, and robust governance for AI-generated geospatial outputs. This paper argues that GIScience advances best not through a single model type, but by cultivating a diverse, interoperable ecosystem combining open-source foundations for innovation, custom geospatial models, and interdisciplinary collaboration. By critically evaluating the opportunities and challenges of open-source LLMs within the broader GeoAI landscape, this work contributes to a thorough discourse on leveraging LLMs to effectively advance spatial research, policy, and decision-making in an equitable, sustainable, and scientifically rigorous manner.

<title>Rewriting Pre-Training Data Boosts LLM Performance in Math and Code</title>

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) in program synthesis and mathematical reasoning is fundamentally limited by the quality of their pre-training corpora. We introduce two openly licensed datasets, released under the Llama 3.3 Community License, that significantly enhance LLM performance by systematically rewriting public data. SwallowCode (approximately 16.1 billion tokens) refines Python snippets from The-Stack-v2 through a novel four-stage pipeline: syntax validation, pylint-based style filtering, and a two-stage LLM rewriting process that enforces style conformity and transforms snippets into self-contained, algorithmically efficient examples. Unlike prior methods that rely on exclusionary filtering or limited transformations, our transform-and-retain approach upgrades low-quality code, maximizing data utility. SwallowMath (approximately 2.3 billion tokens) enhances Finemath-4+ by removing boilerplate, restoring context, and reformatting solutions into concise, step-by-step explanations. Within a fixed 50 billion token training budget, continual pre-training of Llama-3.1-8B with SwallowCode boosts pass@1 by +17.0 on HumanEval and +17.7 on HumanEval+ compared to Stack-Edu, surpassing the baseline model's code generation capabilities. Similarly, substituting SwallowMath yields +12.4 accuracy on GSM8K and +7.6 on MATH. Ablation studies confirm that each pipeline stage contributes incrementally, with rewriting delivering the largest gains. All datasets, prompts, and checkpoints are publicly available, enabling reproducible research and advancing LLM pre-training for specialized domains.

Abstract: Ancient manuscripts are the primary source of ancient linguistic corpora. However, many ancient manuscripts exhibit duplications due to unintentional repeated publication or deliberate forgery. The Dead Sea Scrolls, for example, include counterfeit fragments, whereas Oracle Bones (OB) contain both republished materials and fabricated specimens. Identifying ancient manuscript duplicates is of great significance for both archaeological curation and ancient history study. In this work, we design a progressive OB duplicate discovery framework that combines unsupervised low-level keypoints matching with high-level text-centric content-based matching to refine and rank the candidate OB duplicates with semantic awareness and interpretability. We compare our model with state-of-the-art content-based image retrieval and image matching methods, showing that our model yields comparable recall performance and the highest simplified mean reciprocal rank scores for both Top-5 and Top-15 retrieval results, and with significantly accelerated computation efficiency. We have discovered over 60 pairs of new OB duplicates in real-world deployment, which were missed by domain experts for decades. Code, model and real-world results are available at: https://github.com/cszhangLMU/OBD-Finder/.

<title>Enhancing Satellite Object Localization with Dilated Convolutions and Attention-aided Spatial Pooling</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05599</link>

arXiv:2505.05599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Object localization in satellite imagery is particularly challenging due to the high variability of objects, low spatial resolution, and interference from noise and dominant features such as clouds and city lights. In this research, we focus on three satellite datasets: upper atmospheric Gravity Waves (GW), mesospheric Bores (Bore), and Ocean Eddies (OE), each presenting its own unique challenges. These challenges include the variability in the scale and appearance of the main object patterns, where the size, shape, and feature extent of objects of interest can differ significantly. To address these challenges, we introduce YOLO-DCAP, a novel enhanced version of YOLOv5 designed to improve object localization in these complex scenarios. YOLO-DCAP incorporates a Multi-scale Dilated Residual Convolution (MDRC) block to capture multi-scale features at scale with varying dilation rates, and an Attention-aided Spatial Pooling (AaSP) module to focus on the global relevant spatial regions, enhancing feature selection. These structural improvements help to better localize objects in satellite imagery. Experimental results demonstrate that YOLO-DCAP significantly outperforms both the YOLO base model and state-of-the-art approaches, achieving an average improvement of 20.95% in mAP50 and 32.23% in IoU over the base model, and 7.35% and 9.84% respectively over state-of-the-art alternatives, consistently across all three satellite datasets. These consistent gains across all three satellite datasets highlight the robustness and generalizability of the proposed approach. Our code is open sourced at https://github.com/AI-4-atmosphere-remote-sensing/satellite-object-localization.

arXiv:2505.06520v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is often desirable to remove (a.k.a. unlearn) a specific part of the training data from a trained neural network model. A typical application scenario is to protect the data holder's right to be forgotten, which has been promoted by many recent regulation rules. Existing unlearning methods involve training alternative models with remaining data, which may be costly and challenging to verify from the data holder or a thirdparty auditor's perspective. In this work, we provide a new angle and propose a novel unlearning approach by imposing carefully crafted "patch" on the original neural network to achieve targeted "forgetting" of the requested data to delete. Specifically, inspired by the research line of neural network repair, we propose to strategically seek a lightweight minimum "patch" for unlearning a given data point with certifiable guarantee. Furthermore, to unlearn a considerable amount of data points (or an entire class), we propose to iteratively select a small subset of representative data points to unlearn, which achieves the effect of unlearning the whole set. Extensive experiments on multiple categorical datasets demonstrates our approach's effectiveness, achieving measurable unlearning while preserving the model's performance and being competitive in efficiency and memory consumption compared to various baseline methods.

arXiv:2505.08829v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An algorithm that outputs predictions about the state of the world will almost always be designed with the implicit or explicit goal of outputting accurate predictions (i.e., predictions that are likely to be true). In addition, the rise of increasingly powerful predictive algorithms brought about by the recent revolution in artificial intelligence has led to an emphasis on building predictive algorithms that are fair, in the sense that their predictions do not systematically evince bias or bring about harm to certain individuals or groups. This state of affairs presents two conceptual challenges. First, the goals of accuracy and fairness can sometimes be in tension, and there are no obvious normative guidelines for managing the trade-offs between these two desiderata when they arise. Second, there are many distinct ways of measuring both the accuracy and fairness of a predictive algorithm; here too, there are no obvious guidelines on how to aggregate our preferences for predictive algorithms that satisfy disparate measures of fairness and accuracy to various extents. The goal of this paper is to address these challenges by arguing that there are good reasons for using a linear combination of accuracy and fairness metrics to measure the all-things-considered value of a predictive algorithm for agents who care about both accuracy and fairness. My argument depends crucially on a classic result in the preference aggregation literature due to Harsanyi. After making this formal argument, I apply my result to an analysis of accuracy-fairness trade-offs using the COMPAS dataset compiled by Angwin et al.

arXiv:2505.09166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the creative practice of text-to-image generation (TTI), images are generated from text prompts. However, TTI models are trained to always yield an output, even if the prompt contains unknown terms. In this case, the model may generate what we call "default images": images that closely resemble each other across many unrelated prompts. We argue studying default images is valuable for designing better solutions for TTI and prompt engineering. In this paper, we provide the first investigation into default images on Midjourney, a popular image generator. We describe our systematic approach to create input prompts triggering default images, and present the results of our initial experiments and several small-scale ablation studies. We also report on a survey study investigating how default images affect user satisfaction. Our work lays the foundation for understanding default images in TTI and highlights challenges and future research directions.

Abstract: The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in conversational AI is hindered by their reliance on single-turn supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data, which limits contextual coherence in multi-turn dialogues. Existing methods for generating multi-turn dialogue data struggle to ensure both diversity and quality in instructions. To address this, we propose Review-Instruct, a novel framework that synthesizes multi-turn conversations through an iterative "Ask-Respond-Review" process involving three agent roles: a Candidate, multiple Reviewers, and a Chairman. The framework iteratively refines instructions by incorporating Reviewer feedback, enhancing dialogue diversity and difficulty. We construct a multi-turn dataset using the Alpaca dataset and fine-tune the LLaMA2-13B model. Evaluations on MT-Bench, MMLU-Pro, and Auto-Arena demonstrate significant improvements, achieving absolute gains of 2.9\% on MMLU-Pro and 2\% on MT-Bench compared to prior state-of-the-art models based on LLaMA2-13B. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of the Review stage and the use of multiple Reviewers in boosting instruction diversity and difficulty. Our work highlights the potential of review-driven, multi-agent frameworks for generating high-quality conversational data at scale.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in multi-modal tasks by effectively aligning visual and textual representations. However, most video understanding VLM research has been domain-agnostic, leaving the understanding of their transfer learning capability to specialized domains under-explored. In this work, we address this by exploring the adaptability of open-source VLMs to specific domains, and focusing on soccer as an initial case study. Our approach uses large-scale soccer datasets and LLM to create instruction-following data, and use them to iteratively fine-tune the general-domain VLM in a curriculum learning fashion (first teaching the model key soccer concepts to then question answering tasks). The final adapted model, trained using a curated dataset of 20k video clips, exhibits significant improvement in soccer-specific tasks compared to the base model, with a 37.5% relative improvement for the visual question-answering task and an accuracy improvement from 11.8% to 63.5% for the downstream soccer action classification task.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong generative capabilities across domains ranging from image synthesis to complex reasoning tasks. However, most inference-time scaling methods rely on fixed denoising schedules, limiting their ability to allocate computation based on instance difficulty or task-specific demands adaptively. We introduce the challenge of adaptive inference-time scaling-dynamically adjusting computational effort during inference-and propose Adaptive Bi-directional Cyclic Diffusion (ABCD), a flexible, search-based inference framework. ABCD refines outputs through bi-directional diffusion cycles while adaptively controlling exploration depth and termination. It comprises three components: Cyclic Diffusion Search, Automatic Exploration-Exploitation Balancing, and Adaptive Thinking Time. Experiments show that ABCD improves performance across diverse tasks while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown capabilities in interpreting visual content, but their reliability in safety-critical everyday life scenarios remains insufficiently explored. We introduce VERI (Visual Emergency Recognition Dataset), a diagnostic benchmark comprising 200 images organized into 100 contrastive pairs. Each emergency scene is paired with a visually similar but safe counterpart through human verification and refinement. Using a two-stage evaluation protocol - risk identification and emergency response - we assess 14 VLMs (2B to 124B parameters) across medical emergencies, accidents, and natural disasters. Our analysis reveals an "overreaction problem", where models accurately identify genuine emergencies (70-100 percent success rate) but produce high false-positive rates, misclassifying 31-96 percent of safe situations as dangerous. Ten safe scenarios were universally misclassified by all models regardless of scale. This "better-safe-than-sorry" bias primarily results from contextual overinterpretation (88-93 percent of errors), challenging VLM reliability in safety-critical applications. These findings highlight fundamental limitations in current VLM architectures, which persist despite increased model scale. Our results demonstrate an urgent need for strategies specifically improving contextual reasoning in ambiguous visual situations. The consistently low performance of the model indicates that these data serve effectively as a diagnostic dataset.

<title>Extended Inductive Reasoning for Personalized Preference Inference from Behavioral Signals</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success in complex reasoning tasks such as math and coding. In contrast to these tasks where deductive reasoning predominates, inductive reasoning-the ability to derive general rules from incomplete evidence, remains underexplored. This paper investigates extended inductive reasoning in LLMs through the lens of personalized preference inference, a critical challenge in LLM alignment where current approaches struggle to capture diverse user preferences. The task demands strong inductive reasoning capabilities as user preferences are typically embedded implicitly across various interaction forms, requiring models to synthesize consistent preference patterns from scattered signals. We propose AlignXplore, a model that leverages extended reasoning chains to enable systematic preference inference from behavioral signals in users' interaction histories. Such explicit preference articulation enables efficient streaming inference: when new behavioral signals emerge, the model can directly build upon previously inferred preference descriptions rather than reprocessing historical signals from scratch, while also supporting iterative refinement to the inferred preferences. We develop AlignXplore by combining cold-start training based on synthetic data with subsequent online reinforcement learning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that AlignXplore achieves substantial improvements over the backbone model by an average of 15.49\% on in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks, while maintaining strong generalization ability across different input formats and downstream models. Further analyses establish best practices for preference inference learning through systematic comparison of reward modeling strategies, while revealing the emergence of human-like inductive reasoning patterns during training.

<title>Deep Retrieval at CheckThat! 2025: Identifying Scientific Papers from Implicit Social Media Mentions via Hybrid Retrieval and Re-Ranking</title>

Abstract: We present the methodology and results of the Deep Retrieval team for subtask 4b of the CLEF CheckThat! 2025 competition, which focuses on retrieving relevant scientific literature for given social media posts. To address this task, we propose a hybrid retrieval pipeline that combines lexical precision, semantic generalization, and deep contextual re-ranking, enabling robust retrieval that bridges the informal-to-formal language gap. Specifically, we combine BM25-based keyword matching with a FAISS vector store using a fine-tuned INF-Retriever-v1 model for dense semantic retrieval. BM25 returns the top 30 candidates, and semantic search yields 100 candidates, which are then merged and re-ranked via a large language model (LLM)-based cross-encoder.
  Our approach achieves a mean reciprocal rank at 5 (MRR@5) of 76.46% on the development set and 66.43% on the hidden test set, securing the 1st position on the development leaderboard and ranking 3rd on the test leaderboard (out of 31 teams), with a relative performance gap of only 2 percentage points compared to the top-ranked system. We achieve this strong performance by running open-source models locally and without external training data, highlighting the effectiveness of a carefully designed and fine-tuned retrieval pipeline.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, particularly Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), are indispensable for efficiently customizing Large Language Models (LLMs). However, vanilla LoRA suffers from slow convergence speed and knowledge forgetting problems. Recent studies have leveraged the power of designed LoRA initialization, to enhance the fine-tuning efficiency, or to preserve knowledge in the pre-trained LLM. However, none of these works can address the two cases at the same time. To this end, we introduce Subspace-Constrained LoRA (SC-LoRA), a novel LoRA initialization framework engineered to navigate the trade-off between efficient fine-tuning and knowledge preservation. We achieve this by constraining the output of trainable LoRA adapters in a low-rank subspace, where the context information of fine-tuning data is most preserved while the context information of preserved knowledge is least retained, in a balanced way. Such constraint enables the trainable weights to primarily focus on the main features of fine-tuning data while avoiding damaging the preserved knowledge features. We provide theoretical analysis on our method, and conduct extensive experiments including safety preservation and world knowledge preservation, on various downstream tasks. In our experiments, SC-LoRA succeeds in delivering superior fine-tuning performance while markedly diminishing knowledge forgetting, surpassing contemporary LoRA initialization methods.

Abstract: Autoregressive video models offer distinct advantages over bidirectional diffusion models in creating interactive video content and supporting streaming applications with arbitrary duration. In this work, we present Next-Frame Diffusion (NFD), an autoregressive diffusion transformer that incorporates block-wise causal attention, enabling iterative sampling and efficient inference via parallel token generation within each frame. Nonetheless, achieving real-time video generation remains a significant challenge for such models, primarily due to the high computational cost associated with diffusion sampling and the hardware inefficiencies inherent to autoregressive generation. To address this, we introduce two innovations: (1) We extend consistency distillation to the video domain and adapt it specifically for video models, enabling efficient inference with few sampling steps; (2) To fully leverage parallel computation, motivated by the observation that adjacent frames often share the identical action input, we propose speculative sampling. In this approach, the model generates next few frames using current action input, and discard speculatively generated frames if the input action differs. Experiments on a large-scale action-conditioned video generation benchmark demonstrate that NFD beats autoregressive baselines in terms of both visual quality and sampling efficiency. We, for the first time, achieves autoregressive video generation at over 30 Frames Per Second (FPS) on an A100 GPU using a 310M model.

Abstract: By recursively nesting sums and products, probabilistic circuits have emerged in recent years as an attractive class of generative models as they enjoy, for instance, polytime marginalization of random variables. In this work we study these machine learning models using the framework of quantum information theory, leading to the introduction of positive unital circuits (PUnCs), which generalize circuit evaluations over positive real-valued probabilities to circuit evaluations over positive semi-definite matrices. As a consequence, PUnCs strictly generalize probabilistic circuits as well as recently introduced circuit classes such as PSD circuits.

arXiv:2506.03589v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-video retrieval (TVR) systems often suffer from visual-linguistic biases present in datasets, which cause pre-trained vision-language models to overlook key details. To address this, we propose BiMa, a novel framework designed to mitigate biases in both visual and textual representations. Our approach begins by generating scene elements that characterize each video by identifying relevant entities/objects and activities. For visual debiasing, we integrate these scene elements into the video embeddings, enhancing them to emphasize fine-grained and salient details. For textual debiasing, we introduce a mechanism to disentangle text features into content and bias components, enabling the model to focus on meaningful content while separately handling biased information. Extensive experiments and ablation studies across five major TVR benchmarks (i.e., MSR-VTT, MSVD, LSMDC, ActivityNet, and DiDeMo) demonstrate the competitive performance of BiMa. Additionally, the model's bias mitigation capability is consistently validated by its strong results on out-of-distribution retrieval tasks.

Abstract: Reward Models, essential for guiding Large Language Model optimization, are typically trained on fixed preference datasets, resulting in rigid alignment to single, implicit preference distributions. This prevents adaptation to diverse real-world needs-from conciseness in one task to detailed explanations in another. The standard practice of collecting task-specific preference data and retraining reward models is resource-intensive, often producing biased rewards, and limits practical application. We introduce generalizable, principle-following reward models. We propose that RMs should understand and adhere to dynamically provided natural language specifications of reward principles, similar to instruction-following in LLMs. To measure this capability, we develop RABench, a comprehensive benchmark for RMs focusing on generalization across diverse principles. Evaluations on RABench reveal poor generalization of current RMs. As a solution, we present RewardAnything, a novel RM designed and trained to explicitly follow natural language principles. We achieve SotA performance with RewardAnything in traditional RM benchmark simply by specifying a well-defined principle, and results on RABench show we excel in adapting to novel principles without retraining. Furthermore, RewardAnything integrates seamlessly with existing RLHF methods and we show by a case study on how to automatically and efficiently align LLMs with only natural language principles.

Abstract: Building capable household and industrial robots requires mastering the control of versatile, high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) systems such as mobile manipulators. While reinforcement learning (RL) holds promise for autonomously acquiring robot control policies, scaling it to high-DoF embodiments remains challenging. Direct RL in the real world demands both safe exploration and high sample efficiency, which are difficult to achieve in practice. Sim-to-real RL, on the other hand, is often brittle due to the reality gap. This paper introduces SLAC, a method that renders real-world RL feasible for complex embodiments by leveraging a low-fidelity simulator to pretrain a task-agnostic latent action space. SLAC trains this latent action space via a customized unsupervised skill discovery method designed to promote temporal abstraction, disentanglement, and safety, thereby facilitating efficient downstream learning. Once a latent action space is learned, SLAC uses it as the action interface for a novel off-policy RL algorithm to autonomously learn downstream tasks through real-world interactions. We evaluate SLAC against existing methods on a suite of bimanual mobile manipulation tasks, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, SLAC learns contact-rich whole-body tasks in under an hour of real-world interactions, without relying on any demonstrations or hand-crafted behavior priors.

Abstract: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity bridges the gap between neuroscience and computer vision. Even though progress has been made in decoding images from fMRI using generative models, a challenge remains in accurately recovering highly complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from their elemental density and diversity, sophisticated spatial structures, and multifaceted semantic information.
  To address these challenges, we propose HAVIR that contains two adapters: (1) The AutoKL Adapter transforms fMRI voxels into a latent diffusion prior, capturing topological structures; (2) The CLIP Adapter converts the voxels to CLIP text and image embeddings, containing semantic information. These complementary representations are fused by Versatile Diffusion to generate the final reconstructed image. To extract the most essential semantic information from complex scenarios, the CLIP Adapter is trained with text captions describing the visual stimuli and their corresponding semantic images synthesized from these captions. The experimental results demonstrate that HAVIR effectively reconstructs both structural features and semantic information of visual stimuli even in complex scenarios, outperforming existing models.

Abstract: Scientific recommender systems, such as Google Scholar and Web of Science, are essential tools for discovery. Search algorithms that power work through stigmergy, a collective intelligence mechanism that surfaces useful paths through repeated engagement. While generally effective, this "rich-get-richer" dynamic results in a small number of high-profile papers that dominate visibility. This essay argues argue that these algorithm over-reliance on popularity fosters intellectual homogeneity and exacerbates structural inequities, stifling innovative and diverse perspectives critical for scientific progress. We propose an overhaul of search platforms to incorporate user-specific calibration, allowing researchers to manually adjust the weights of factors like popularity, recency, and relevance. We also advise platform developers on how text embeddings and LLMs could be implemented in ways that increase user autonomy. While our suggestions are particularly pertinent to aligning recommender systems with scientific values, these ideas are broadly applicable to information access systems in general. Designing platforms that increase user autonomy is an important step toward more robust and dynamic information

<title>FinBERT2: A Specialized Bidirectional Encoder for Bridging the Gap in Finance-Specific Deployment of Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2506.06335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In natural language processing (NLP), the focus has shifted from encoder-only tiny language models like BERT to decoder-only large language models(LLMs) such as GPT-3. However, LLMs' practical application in the financial sector has revealed three limitations: (1) LLMs often perform worse than fine-tuned BERT on discriminative tasks despite costing much higher computational resources, such as market sentiment analysis in financial reports; (2) Application on generative tasks heavily relies on retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods to provide current and specialized information, with general retrievers showing suboptimal performance on domain-specific retrieval tasks; (3) There are additional inadequacies in other feature-based scenarios, such as topic modeling. We introduce FinBERT2, a specialized bidirectional encoder pretrained on a high-quality, financial-specific corpus of 32b tokens. This represents the largest known Chinese financial pretraining corpus for models of this parameter size. As a better backbone, FinBERT2 can bridge the gap in the financial-specific deployment of LLMs through the following achievements: (1) Discriminative fine-tuned models (Fin-Labelers) outperform other (Fin)BERT variants by 0.4%-3.3% and leading LLMs by 9.7%-12.3% on average across five financial classification tasks. (2) Contrastive fine-tuned models (Fin-Retrievers) outperform both open-source (e.g., +6.8\% avg improvement over BGE-base-zh) and proprietary (e.g., +4.2\% avg improvement over OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large) embedders across five financial retrieval tasks; (3) Building on FinBERT2 variants, we construct the Fin-TopicModel, which enables superior clustering and topic representation for financial titles. Our work revisits financial BERT models through comparative analysis with contemporary LLMs and offers practical insights for effectively utilizing FinBERT in the LLMs era.

Abstract: Existing offline hierarchical reinforcement learning methods rely on high-level policy learning to generate subgoal sequences. However, their efficiency degrades as task horizons increase, and they lack effective strategies for stitching useful state transitions across different trajectories. We propose Graph-Assisted Stitching (GAS), a novel framework that formulates subgoal selection as a graph search problem rather than learning an explicit high-level policy. By embedding states into a Temporal Distance Representation (TDR) space, GAS clusters semantically similar states from different trajectories into unified graph nodes, enabling efficient transition stitching. A shortest-path algorithm is then applied to select subgoal sequences within the graph, while a low-level policy learns to reach the subgoals. To improve graph quality, we introduce the Temporal Efficiency (TE) metric, which filters out noisy or inefficient transition states, significantly enhancing task performance. GAS outperforms prior offline HRL methods across locomotion, navigation, and manipulation tasks. Notably, in the most stitching-critical task, it achieves a score of 88.3, dramatically surpassing the previous state-of-the-art score of 1.0. Our source code is available at: https://github.com/qortmdgh4141/GAS.

Abstract: Efficient and accurate motion prediction is crucial for ensuring safety and informed decision-making in autonomous driving, particularly under dynamic real-world conditions that necessitate multi-modal forecasts. We introduce TrajFlow, a novel flow matching-based motion prediction framework that addresses the scalability and efficiency challenges of existing generative trajectory prediction methods. Unlike conventional generative approaches that employ i.i.d. sampling and require multiple inference passes to capture diverse outcomes, TrajFlow predicts multiple plausible future trajectories in a single pass, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining coherence across predictions. Moreover, we propose a ranking loss based on the Plackett-Luce distribution to improve uncertainty estimation of predicted trajectories. Additionally, we design a self-conditioning training technique that reuses the model's own predictions to construct noisy inputs during a second forward pass, thereby improving generalization and accelerating inference. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) demonstrate that TrajFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across various key metrics, underscoring its effectiveness for safety-critical autonomous driving applications. The code and other details are available on the project website https://traj-flow.github.io/.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization capabilities across various tasks, but their claim to practical relevance is still mired by concerns on their reliability. Recent works have proposed examining the activations produced by an LLM at inference time to assess whether its answer to a question is correct. Some works claim that a "geometry of truth" can be learned from examples, in the sense that the activations that generate correct answers can be distinguished from those leading to mistakes with a linear classifier. In this work, we underline a limitation of these approaches: we observe that these "geometries of truth" are intrinsically task-dependent and fail to transfer across tasks. More precisely, we show that linear classifiers trained across distinct tasks share little similarity and, when trained with sparsity-enforcing regularizers, have almost disjoint supports. We show that more sophisticated approaches (e.g., using mixtures of probes and tasks) fail to overcome this limitation, likely because activation vectors commonly used to classify answers form clearly separated clusters when examined across tasks.

Abstract: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), especially at the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage, is vital yet hindered by subjective assessments and the high cost of multimodal imaging modalities. Although deep learning methods offer automated alternatives, their energy inefficiency and computational demands limit real-world deployment, particularly in resource-constrained settings. As a brain-inspired paradigm, spiking neural networks (SNNs) are inherently well-suited for modeling the sparse, event-driven patterns of neural degeneration in AD, offering a promising foundation for interpretable and low-power medical diagnostics. However, existing SNNs often suffer from weak expressiveness and unstable training, which restrict their effectiveness in complex medical tasks. To address these limitations, we propose FasterSNN, a hybrid neural architecture that integrates biologically inspired LIF neurons with region-adaptive convolution and multi-scale spiking attention. This design enables sparse, efficient processing of 3D MRI while preserving diagnostic accuracy. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FasterSNN achieves competitive performance with substantially improved efficiency and stability, supporting its potential for practical AD screening. Our source code is available at https://github.com/wuchangw/FasterSNN.

Abstract: The rapid growth of deep learning has driven exponential increases in model parameters and computational demands. NVIDIA GPUs and their CUDA-based software ecosystem provide robust support for parallel computing, significantly alleviating computational bottlenecks. Meanwhile, due to the cultivation of user programming habits and the high performance of GPUs, the CUDA ecosystem has established a dominant position in the field of parallel software. This dominance requires other hardware platforms to support CUDA-based software with performance portability. However, translating CUDA code to other platforms poses significant challenges due to differences in parallel programming paradigms and hardware architectures. Existing approaches rely on language extensions, domain-specific languages (DSLs), or compilers but face limitations in workload coverage and generalizability. Moreover, these methods often incur substantial development costs. Recently, LLMs have demonstrated extraordinary potential in various vertical domains, especially in code-related tasks. However, the performance of existing LLMs in CUDA transpilation, particularly for high-performance code, remains suboptimal. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework for generating high-performance CUDA and corresponding platform code pairs, leveraging AI compiler and automatic optimization technology. We further enhance the framework with a graph-based data augmentation method and introduce HPCTransEval, a benchmark for evaluating LLM performance on CUDA transpilation. We conduct experiments using CUDA-to-CPU transpilation as a case study on leading LLMs. The speedup ratio of the CPU operators has an average improvemnet of 43.8\%, highlighting the potential of LLMs to address compatibility challenges within the CUDA ecosystem.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing real-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key technique for enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities, yet its data inefficiency remains a major bottleneck. To address this critical yet challenging issue, we present a novel gradient-alignment-based method, named LearnAlign, which intelligently selects the learnable and representative training reasoning data for RL post-training. To overcome the issue of response-length bias in gradient norms, we introduce the data learnability based on the success rate, which can indicate the learning potential of each data point. Experiments across three mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces training data requirements while achieving minor performance degradation or even improving performance compared to full-data training. For example, it reduces data requirements by up to 1,000 data points with better performance (77.53%) than that on the full dataset on GSM8K benchmark (77.04%). Furthermore, we show its effectiveness in the staged RL setting. This work provides valuable insights into data-efficient RL post-training and establishes a foundation for future research in optimizing reasoning data selection. To facilitate future work, we will release code.

Abstract: A widely recognized limitation of molecular prediction models is their reliance on structures observed in the training data, resulting in poor generalization to out-of-distribution compounds. Yet in drug discovery, the compounds most critical for advancing research often lie beyond the training set, making the bias toward the training data particularly problematic. This mismatch introduces substantial covariate shift, under which standard deep learning models produce unstable and inaccurate predictions. Furthermore, the scarcity of labeled data, stemming from the onerous and costly nature of experimental validation, further exacerbates the difficulty of achieving reliable generalization. To address these limitations, we propose a novel meta-learning-based approach that leverages unlabeled data to interpolate between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data, enabling the model to meta-learn how to generalize beyond the training distribution. We demonstrate significant performance gains on challenging real-world datasets with substantial covariate shift, supported by t-SNE visualizations highlighting our interpolation method.

<title>Casper: Inferring Diverse Intents for Assistive Teleoperation with Vision Language Models</title>

Abstract: Assistive teleoperation, where control is shared between a human and a robot, enables efficient and intuitive human-robot collaboration in diverse and unstructured environments. A central challenge in real-world assistive teleoperation is for the robot to infer a wide range of human intentions from user control inputs and to assist users with correct actions. Existing methods are either confined to simple, predefined scenarios or restricted to task-specific data distributions at training, limiting their support for real-world assistance. We introduce Casper, an assistive teleoperation system that leverages commonsense knowledge embedded in pre-trained visual language models (VLMs) for real-time intent inference and flexible skill execution. Casper incorporates an open-world perception module for a generalized understanding of novel objects and scenes, a VLM-powered intent inference mechanism that leverages commonsense reasoning to interpret snippets of teleoperated user input, and a skill library that expands the scope of prior assistive teleoperation systems to support diverse, long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks. Extensive empirical evaluation, including human studies and system ablations, demonstrates that Casper improves task performance, reduces human cognitive load, and achieves higher user satisfaction than direct teleoperation and assistive teleoperation baselines.

Abstract: Quadrupedal robots have demonstrated impressive locomotion capabilities in complex environments, but equipping them with autonomous versatile manipulation skills in a scalable way remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce a cross-embodiment imitation learning system for quadrupedal manipulation, leveraging data collected from both humans and LocoMan, a quadruped equipped with multiple manipulation modes. Specifically, we develop a teleoperation and data collection pipeline, which unifies and modularizes the observation and action spaces of the human and the robot. To effectively leverage the collected data, we propose an efficient modularized architecture that supports co-training and pretraining on structured modality-aligned data across different embodiments. Additionally, we construct the first manipulation dataset for the LocoMan robot, covering various household tasks in both unimanual and bimanual modes, supplemented by a corresponding human dataset. We validate our system on six real-world manipulation tasks, where it achieves an average success rate improvement of 41.9% overall and 79.7% under out-of-distribution (OOD) settings compared to the baseline. Pretraining with human data contributes a 38.6% success rate improvement overall and 82.7% under OOD settings, enabling consistently better performance with only half the amount of robot data.

<title>RoboMonkey: Scaling Test-Time Sampling and Verification for Vision-Language-Action Models</title>

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visuomotor control, yet ensuring their robustness in unstructured real-world environments remains a persistent challenge. In this paper, we investigate test-time scaling through the lens of sampling and verification as means to enhance the robustness and generalization of VLAs. We first demonstrate that the relationship between action error and the number of generated samples follows an exponentiated power law across a range of VLAs, indicating the existence of inference-time scaling laws. Building on these insights, we introduce RoboMonkey, a test-time scaling framework for VLAs. At deployment, RoboMonkey samples a small set of actions from a VLA, applies Gaussian perturbation and majority voting to construct an action proposal distribution, and then uses a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based verifier to select the optimal action. We propose a synthetic data generation pipeline for training such VLM-based action verifiers, and demonstrate that scaling the synthetic dataset consistently improves verification and downstream accuracy. Through extensive simulated and hardware experiments, we show that pairing existing VLAs with RoboMonkey yields significant performance gains, achieving a 25% absolute improvement on out-of-distribution tasks and 9% on in-distribution tasks. Additionally, when adapting to new robot setups, we show that fine-tuning both VLAs and action verifiers yields a 7% performance increase compared to fine-tuning VLAs alone.

arXiv:2506.18501v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing (NLP) tasks has sparked significant interest in evaluating their effectiveness across diverse applications. While models like ChatGPT and DeepSeek have shown strong results in many NLP domains, a comprehensive evaluation is needed to understand their strengths, weaknesses, and domain-specific abilities. This is critical as these models are applied to various tasks, from sentiment analysis to more nuanced tasks like textual entailment and translation. This study aims to evaluate ChatGPT and DeepSeek across five key NLP tasks: sentiment analysis, topic classification, text summarization, machine translation, and textual entailment. A structured experimental protocol is used to ensure fairness and minimize variability. Both models are tested with identical, neutral prompts and evaluated on two benchmark datasets per task, covering domains like news, reviews, and formal/informal texts. The results show that DeepSeek excels in classification stability and logical reasoning, while ChatGPT performs better in tasks requiring nuanced understanding and flexibility. These findings provide valuable insights for selecting the appropriate LLM based on task requirements.

<title>NOVA: Navigation via Object-Centric Visual Autonomy for High-Speed Target Tracking in Unstructured GPS-Denied Environments</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.18689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous aerial target tracking in unstructured and GPS-denied environments remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. Many existing methods rely on motion capture systems, pre-mapped scenes, or feature-based localization to ensure safety and control, limiting their deployment in real-world conditions. We introduce NOVA, a fully onboard, object-centric framework that enables robust target tracking and collision-aware navigation using only a stereo camera and an IMU. Rather than constructing a global map or relying on absolute localization, NOVA formulates perception, estimation, and control entirely in the target's reference frame. A tightly integrated stack combines a lightweight object detector with stereo depth completion, followed by histogram-based filtering to infer robust target distances under occlusion and noise. These measurements feed a visual-inertial state estimator that recovers the full 6-DoF pose of the robot relative to the target. A nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) plans dynamically feasible trajectories in the target frame. To ensure safety, high-order control barrier functions are constructed online from a compact set of high-risk collision points extracted from depth, enabling real-time obstacle avoidance without maps or dense representations. We validate NOVA across challenging real-world scenarios, including urban mazes, forest trails, and repeated transitions through buildings with intermittent GPS loss and severe lighting changes that disrupt feature-based localization. Each experiment is repeated multiple times under similar conditions to assess resilience, showing consistent and reliable performance. NOVA achieves agile target following at speeds exceeding 50 km/h. These results show that high-speed vision-based tracking is possible in the wild using only onboard sensing, with no reliance on external localization or environment assumptions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise in automating data analysis tasks, yet open-source models face significant limitations in these kinds of reasoning-intensive scenarios. In this work, we investigate strategies to enhance the data analysis capabilities of open-source LLMs. By curating a seed dataset of diverse, realistic scenarios, we evaluate models across three dimensions: data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning. Our analysis reveals three key findings: (1) Strategic planning quality serves as the primary determinant of model performance; (2) Interaction design and task complexity significantly influence reasoning capabilities; (3) Data quality demonstrates a greater impact than diversity in achieving optimal performance. We leverage these insights to develop a data synthesis methodology, demonstrating significant improvements in open-source LLMs' analytical reasoning capabilities.

<title>Position: Machine Learning Conferences Should Establish a "Refutations and Critiques" Track</title>

arXiv:2506.19882v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Science progresses by iteratively advancing and correcting humanity's understanding of the world. In machine learning (ML) research, rapid advancements have led to an explosion of publications, but have also led to misleading, incorrect, flawed or perhaps even fraudulent studies being accepted and sometimes highlighted at ML conferences due to the fallibility of peer review. While such mistakes are understandable, ML conferences do not offer robust processes to help the field systematically correct when such errors are made. This position paper argues that ML conferences should establish a dedicated "Refutations and Critiques" (R&amp;C) Track. This R&amp;C Track would provide a high-profile, reputable platform to support vital research that critically challenges prior research, thereby fostering a dynamic self-correcting research ecosystem. We discuss key considerations including track design, review principles, potential pitfalls, and provide an illustrative example submission concerning a recent ICLR 2025 Oral. We conclude that ML conferences should create official, reputable mechanisms to help ML research self-correct.

<title>Inside you are many wolves: Using cognitive models to interpret value trade-offs in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Navigating everyday social situations often requires juggling conflicting goals, such as conveying a harsh truth, maintaining trust, all while still being mindful of another person's feelings. These value trade-offs are an integral part of human decision-making and language use, however, current tools for interpreting such dynamic and multi-faceted notions of values in LLMs are limited. In cognitive science, so-called "cognitive models" provide formal accounts of these trade-offs in humans, by modeling the weighting of a speaker's competing utility functions in choosing an action or utterance. In this work, we use a leading cognitive model of polite speech to interpret the extent to which LLMs represent human-like trade-offs. We apply this lens to systematically evaluate value trade-offs in two encompassing model settings: degrees of reasoning "effort" in frontier black-box models, and RL post-training dynamics of open-source models. Our results highlight patterns of higher informational utility than social utility in reasoning models, and in open-source models shown to be stronger in mathematical reasoning. Our findings from LLMs' training dynamics suggest large shifts in utility values early on in training with persistent effects of the choice of base model and pretraining data, compared to feedback dataset or alignment method. We show that our method is responsive to diverse aspects of the rapidly evolving LLM landscape, with insights for forming hypotheses about other high-level behaviors, shaping training regimes for reasoning models, and better controlling trade-offs between values during model training.

Abstract: Autonomous driving technologies face significant safety challenges while operating under rare, diverse, and visually degraded weather scenarios. These challenges become more critical in cooperative settings, where vehicles and infrastructure jointly perceive and reason across complex environments. To address these issues, we propose SEAL, a vision-language model-based framework with adaptive multimodal learning for robust cooperative autonomous driving under long-tail scenarios. SEAL introduces three core innovations: (i) a prompt-driven long-tail scenario generation and evaluation pipeline that leverages foundation models to synthesize realistic long-tail conditions such as snow and fog across vehicle- and infrastructure-side views, enriching training diversity efficiently; (ii) a gated multi-scenario adaptive attention module that modulates the visual stream using scenario priors to recalibrate ambiguous or corrupted features; and (iii) a multi-task scenario-aware contrastive learning objective that improves multimodal alignment and promotes cross-scenario feature separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEAL significantly outperforms existing baselines in reasoning, safety, and planning accuracy under complex, challenging driving conditions, advancing the safety, robustness, and scalability of autonomous driving.

<title>Towards Understanding the Cognitive Habits of Large Reasoning Models</title>

arXiv:2506.21571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), which autonomously produce a reasoning Chain of Thought (CoT) before producing final responses, offer a promising approach to interpreting and monitoring model behaviors. Inspired by the observation that certain CoT patterns -- e.g., ``Wait, did I miss anything?'' -- consistently emerge across tasks, we explore whether LRMs exhibit human-like cognitive habits. Building on Habits of Mind, a well-established framework of cognitive habits associated with successful human problem-solving, we introduce CogTest, a principled benchmark designed to evaluate LRMs' cognitive habits. CogTest includes 16 cognitive habits, each instantiated with 25 diverse tasks, and employs an evidence-first extraction method to ensure reliable habit identification. With CogTest, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 16 widely used LLMs (13 LRMs and 3 non-reasoning ones). Our findings reveal that LRMs, unlike conventional LLMs, not only exhibit human-like habits but also adaptively deploy them according to different tasks. Finer-grained analyses further uncover patterns of similarity and difference in LRMs' cognitive habit profiles, particularly certain inter-family similarity (e.g., Qwen-3 models and DeepSeek-R1). Extending the study to safety-related tasks, we observe that certain habits, such as Taking Responsible Risks, are strongly associated with the generation of harmful responses. These findings suggest that studying persistent behavioral patterns in LRMs' CoTs is a valuable step toward deeper understanding of LLM misbehavior.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), an efficient variant of PPO that lowers RL's computational cost, still faces limited exploration, low sample efficiency and instability, constraining its performance on complex reasoning tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce EFRame, an Exploration-Filter-Replay framework that systematically augments GRPO along three critical dimensions. EFRame performs additional rollouts to explore high-quality trajectories, applies online filtering to eliminate low-quality samples that introduce noise and variance, and leverages experience replay to repeatedly exploit rare but informative samples. EFRame establishes a complete and stable learning cycle, guiding the model through a structured transition from exploration to convergence. Our experiments across a variety of reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that EFRame not only improves the robustness and efficiency of training, but also enables access to deeper reasoning capabilities that remain unattainable under vanilla GRPO. Furthermore, EFRame not only enables fine-grained categorization of training samples for deeper insight into their contributions, but also introduces an efficient and precise mechanism for entropy control, which is critical for balancing exploration and convergence in RL training. Our code is available at https://github.com/597358816/EFRame.

Summary: 
Embodied AI agents, such as virtual avatars, wearable devices, and robots, interact with users and their environments, resembling human learning and interaction processes. The development of world models is essential for these agents, enabling them to understand and predict their surroundings, user intentions, and social contexts, enhancing their autonomy in performing complex tasks. World modeling involves integrating multimodal perception, reasoning for action, and memory to create a comprehensive understanding of the physical world. Additionally, learning the mental world model of users facilitates better collaboration between humans and agents. By embodying AI agents and focusing on world modeling, researchers aim to improve agents' ability to interact effectively and autonomously in diverse environments, ultimately enhancing human-agent collaboration in various settings.

Abstract: This paper describes our research on AI agents embodied in visual, virtual or physical forms, enabling them to interact with both users and their environments. These agents, which include virtual avatars, wearable devices, and robots, are designed to perceive, learn and act within their surroundings, which makes them more similar to how humans learn and interact with the environments as compared to disembodied agents. We propose that the development of world models is central to reasoning and planning of embodied AI agents, allowing these agents to understand and predict their environment, to understand user intentions and social contexts, thereby enhancing their ability to perform complex tasks autonomously. World modeling encompasses the integration of multimodal perception, planning through reasoning for action and control, and memory to create a comprehensive understanding of the physical world. Beyond the physical world, we also propose to learn the mental world model of users to enable better human-agent collaboration.

Abstract: The rapid growth of biomedical data, tools, and literature has created a fragmented research landscape that outpaces human expertise. While AI agents offer a solution, they typically rely on static, manually curated toolsets, limiting their ability to adapt and scale. Here, we introduce STELLA, a self-evolving AI agent designed to overcome these limitations. STELLA employs a multi-agent architecture that autonomously improves its own capabilities through two core mechanisms: an evolving Template Library for reasoning strategies and a dynamic Tool Ocean that expands as a Tool Creation Agent automatically discovers and integrates new bioinformatics tools. This allows STELLA to learn from experience. We demonstrate that STELLA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on a suite of biomedical benchmarks, scoring approximately 26\% on Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine, 54\% on LAB-Bench: DBQA, and 63\% on LAB-Bench: LitQA, outperforming leading models by up to 6 percentage points. More importantly, we show that its performance systematically improves with experience; for instance, its accuracy on the Humanity's Last Exam benchmark almost doubles with increased trials. STELLA represents a significant advance towards AI Agent systems that can learn and grow, dynamically scaling their expertise to accelerate the pace of biomedical discovery.

Summary:
In this paper, a novel lightweight rule-based feature selection method called HCVR (Hybrid approach with Correlation-aware Voting Rules) is introduced. HCVR combines Parameter-to-Parameter (P2P) and Parameter-to-Target (P2T) correlations to eliminate redundant features and retain relevant ones. The method uses a hybrid of non-iterative and iterative filtering approaches for dimensionality reduction, working on a greedy backward elimination basis. Decision-making on feature retention is based on majority voting following specific correlation thresholds. The study applied HCVR to the SPAMBASE dataset and demonstrated improved performance compared to traditional non-iterative and iterative techniques like CFS, mRMR, MI, RFE, SFS, and Genetic Algorithm. The performance enhancement was evaluated based on different classifiers after feature filtering. <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose HCVR (Hybrid approach with Correlation-aware Voting Rules), a lightweight rule-based feature selection method that combines Parameter-to-Parameter (P2P) and Parameter-to-Target (P2T) correlations to eliminate redundant features and retain relevant ones. This method is a hybrid of non-iterative and iterative filtering approaches for dimensionality reduction. It is a greedy method, which works by backward elimination, eliminating possibly multiple features at every step. The rules contribute to voting for features, and a decision to keep or discard is made by majority voting. The rules make use of correlation thresholds between every pair of features, and between features and the target. We provide the results from the application of HCVR to the SPAMBASE dataset. The results showed improvement performance as compared to traditional non-iterative (CFS, mRMR and MI) and iterative (RFE, SFS and Genetic Algorithm) techniques. The effectiveness was assessed based on the performance of different classifiers after applying filtering.

Benchmarking various proprietary LLMs reveals trade-offs between reasoning performance and token usage.

arXiv:2507.02076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly progressed into general-purpose agents capable of solving a broad spectrum of tasks. However, current models remain inefficient at reasoning: they apply fixed inference-time compute regardless of task complexity, often overthinking simple problems while underthinking hard ones. This survey presents a comprehensive review of efficient test-time compute (TTC) strategies, which aim to improve the computational efficiency of LLM reasoning. We introduce a two-tiered taxonomy that distinguishes between L1-controllability, methods that operate under fixed compute budgets, and L2-adaptiveness, methods that dynamically scale inference based on input difficulty or model confidence. We benchmark leading proprietary LLMs across diverse datasets, highlighting critical trade-offs between reasoning performance and token usage. Compared to prior surveys on efficient reasoning, our review emphasizes the practical control, adaptability, and scalability of TTC methods. Finally, we discuss emerging trends such as hybrid thinking models and identify key challenges for future work towards making LLMs more computationally efficient, robust, and responsive to user constraints.

Summary: 
The article introduces SciGym, a benchmark designed to assess the experiment design and analysis capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in scientific discovery tasks. Due to the high costs of wet-lab experimentation, SciGym utilizes a dry lab of biological systems encoded in Systems Biology Markup Language to generate simulated data for testing. The evaluation of six frontier LLMs on 137 small systems revealed that while more capable models performed better, all models showed a decline in performance with increasing system complexity. This indicates a need for improvement in the scientific capabilities of LLM agents. The study released a total of 350 systems for further testing and experimentation. SciGym offers a novel approach to testing LLMs in scientific research tasks without the constraints of traditional wet-lab experimentation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.02083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing experiments and result interpretations are core scientific competencies, particularly in biology, where researchers perturb complex systems to uncover the underlying systems. Recent efforts to evaluate the scientific capabilities of large language models (LLMs) fail to test these competencies because wet-lab experimentation is prohibitively expensive: in expertise, time and equipment. We introduce SciGym, a first-in-class benchmark that assesses LLMs' iterative experiment design and analysis abilities in open-ended scientific discovery tasks. SciGym overcomes the challenge of wet-lab costs by running a dry lab of biological systems. These models, encoded in Systems Biology Markup Language, are efficient for generating simulated data, making them ideal testbeds for experimentation on realistically complex systems. We evaluated six frontier LLMs on 137 small systems, and released a total of 350 systems. Our evaluation shows that while more capable models demonstrated superior performance, all models' performance declined significantly as system complexity increased, suggesting substantial room for improvement in the scientific capabilities of LLM agents.

<title>What Neuroscience Can Teach AI About Learning in Continuously Changing Environments</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02103</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02103</guid>

<div> Keywords: AI, neuroscience, continual learning, in-context learning, NeuroAI

Summary:
Continual learning in AI models involves adapting to changing environments, a process analogous to how animals continuously adjust to evolving circumstances in their surroundings. This capability is crucial for social species and can benefit AI systems operating in dynamic real-world scenarios. By integrating neuroscience findings on behavioral adaptation with AI research on continual and in-context learning, insights can be gained on how AI models can be improved to better handle shifting tasks and rewards. The process of learning from neuroscience can also be reciprocal, with AI offering novel perspectives that can inform neuroscience research. This interdisciplinary approach, known as NeuroAI, holds promise for advancing both fields and enhancing the adaptability and performance of AI systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.02103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern AI models, such as large language models, are usually trained once on a huge corpus of data, potentially fine-tuned for a specific task, and then deployed with fixed parameters. Their training is costly, slow, and gradual, requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.

Summary: <br />
- Artificial intelligence systems are being used in various domains to automate decisions, raising concerns about fairness and bias.<br />
- Resampling training data to address bias may not be as effective as it seems, as evaluation is often based on biased datasets.<br />
- Audit studies provide high-quality data for studying discrimination in hiring algorithms, revealing disparities even when base rates are equalized.<br />
- Individual treatment effect estimation methods can help reduce algorithmic discrimination in hiring.<br />
- Using data from audit studies can improve the training and evaluation of automated hiring algorithms. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.02152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems, especially those using machine learning, are being deployed in domains from hiring to loan issuance in order to automate these complex decisions. Judging both the effectiveness and fairness of these AI systems, and their human decision making counterpart, is a complex and important topic studied across both computational and social sciences. Within machine learning, a common way to address bias in downstream classifiers is to resample the training data to offset disparities. For example, if hiring rates vary by some protected class, then one may equalize the rate within the training set to alleviate bias in the resulting classifier. While simple and seemingly effective, these methods have typically only been evaluated using data obtained through convenience samples, introducing selection bias and label bias into metrics. Within the social sciences, psychology, public health, and medicine, audit studies, in which fictitious ``testers'' (e.g., resumes, emails, patient actors) are sent to subjects (e.g., job openings, businesses, doctors) in randomized control trials, provide high quality data that support rigorous estimates of discrimination. In this paper, we investigate how data from audit studies can be used to improve our ability to both train and evaluate automated hiring algorithms. We find that such data reveals cases where the common fairness intervention method of equalizing base rates across classes appears to achieve parity using traditional measures, but in fact has roughly 10% disparity when measured appropriately. We additionally introduce interventions based on individual treatment effect estimation methods that further reduce algorithmic discrimination using this data.

Summary: <div>

Abstract: While recent advances in preference learning have enhanced alignment in human feedback, mathematical reasoning remains a persistent challenge. We investigate how data diversification strategies in preference optimization can improve the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). We evaluate three common data generation methods: temperature sampling, Chain-of-Thought prompting, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and introduce Diversified-ThinkSolve (DTS), a novel structured approach that systematically decomposes problems into diverse reasoning paths. Our results show that with strategically diversified preference data, models can substantially improve mathematical reasoning performance, with the best approach yielding gains of 7.1% on GSM8K and 4.2% on MATH over the base model. Despite its strong performance, DTS incurs only a marginal computational overhead (1.03x) compared to the baseline, while MCTS is nearly five times more costly with lower returns. These findings demonstrate that structured exploration of diverse problem-solving methods creates more effective preference data for mathematical alignment than traditional approaches.

<br />
Summary:<br />
The paper investigates the consistency of Language Model-based role-playing agents' beliefs with their actual behavior. An evaluation framework is established to measure how well beliefs predict simulation outcomes. Using the GenAgents persona bank and the Trust Game, factors affecting belief-behavior consistency are explored. Results show systematic inconsistencies between stated beliefs and simulation outcomes. Models may have plausible beliefs but may not apply them consistently. Researchers need to identify when LLMs' beliefs align with their behavior to use them effectively in behavioral studies. Feasibility of imposing theoretical priors is also discussed. <div>
arXiv:2507.02197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly studied as role-playing agents to generate synthetic data for human behavioral research, ensuring that their outputs remain coherent with their assigned roles has become a critical concern. In this paper, we investigate how consistently LLM-based role-playing agents' stated beliefs about the behavior of the people they are asked to role-play ("what they say") correspond to their actual behavior during role-play ("how they act"). Specifically, we establish an evaluation framework to rigorously measure how well beliefs obtained by prompting the model can predict simulation outcomes in advance. Using an augmented version of the GenAgents persona bank and the Trust Game (a standard economic game used to quantify players' trust and reciprocity), we introduce a belief-behavior consistency metric to systematically investigate how it is affected by factors such as: (1) the types of beliefs we elicit from LLMs, like expected outcomes of simulations versus task-relevant attributes of individual characters LLMs are asked to simulate; (2) when and how we present LLMs with relevant information about Trust Game; and (3) how far into the future we ask the model to forecast its actions. We also explore how feasible it is to impose a researcher's own theoretical priors in the event that the originally elicited beliefs are misaligned with research objectives. Our results reveal systematic inconsistencies between LLMs' stated (or imposed) beliefs and the outcomes of their role-playing simulation, at both an individual- and population-level. Specifically, we find that, even when models appear to encode plausible beliefs, they may fail to apply them in a consistent way. These findings highlight the need to identify how and when LLMs' stated beliefs align with their simulated behavior, allowing researchers to use LLM-based agents appropriately in behavioral studies.

Summary: 
The study explores the impact of dilution and mobility in the spatial version of the prisoner's dilemma using an independent multi-agent Q-learning algorithm. Various actions for the algorithm are defined, demonstrating its versatility in modeling game-theoretical scenarios. The research reveals that fixed update rules can yield similar outcomes to learned ones and highlights a symbiotic mutualistic effect when multiple actions are implemented. The results indicate that static agents can cooperate through diverse mechanisms, such as noise injection and knowledge of neighbors' payoffs.

Abstract: Recent studies in the spatial prisoner's dilemma games with reinforcement learning have shown that static agents can learn to cooperate through a diverse sort of mechanisms, including noise injection, different types of learning algorithms and neighbours' payoff knowledge.In this work, using an independent multi-agent Q-learning algorithm, we study the effects of dilution and mobility in the spatial version of the prisoner's dilemma. Within this setting, different possible actions for the algorithm are defined, connecting with previous results on the classical, non-reinforcement learning spatial prisoner's dilemma, showcasing the versatility of the algorithm in modeling different game-theoretical scenarios and the benchmarking potential of this approach.As a result, a range of effects is observed, including evidence that games with fixed update rules can be qualitatively equivalent to those with learned ones, as well as the emergence of a symbiotic mutualistic effect between populations that forms when multiple actions are defined.

Summary:
The study introduces NL2FLOW, an automated system for generating planning problems in natural language, PDDL, and a structured representation, and evaluating the quality of plans. Results show a high success rate in generating valid and optimal plans using tuned LLMs. The study indicates that unnecessary translation steps degrade performance, highlighting the benefits of models that reason directly from natural language to action. The analysis reveals the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation, contingent on model and prompt design. As LLM reasoning scales to more complex problems, understanding limitations and systematically identifying errors will be essential for maximizing their potential as problem solvers. <div>
arXiv:2507.02253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Progress in enhancing large language model (LLM) planning and reasoning capabilities is significantly hampered by the bottleneck of scalable, reliable data generation and evaluation. To overcome this, I introduce NL2FLOW, a fully automated system for parametrically generating planning problems - expressed in natural language, a structured intermediate representation, and formal PDDL - and rigorously evaluating the quality of generated plans. I demonstrate NL2FLOW's capabilities by generating a dataset of 2296 problems in the automated workflow generation domain and evaluating multiple open-sourced, instruct-tuned LLMs. My results reveal that the highest performing models achieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal plans, specifically for problems with feasible solutions. Regression analysis shows that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is contingent on both model and prompt design. Notably, I observed that the highest success rate for translating natural language into a JSON representation of a plan was lower than the highest rate of generating a valid plan directly. This suggests that unnecessarily decomposing the reasoning task - introducing intermediate translation steps - may actually degrade performance, implying a benefit to models capable of reasoning directly from natural language to action. As I scale LLM reasoning to increasingly complex problems, the bottlenecks and sources of error within these systems will inevitably shift. Therefore, a dynamic understanding of these limitations - and the tools to systematically reveal them - will be crucial for unlocking the full potential of LLMs as intelligent problem solvers.

<div> belief revision, postulates, abilities, states of beliefs, revision mechanisms

Summary:
Belief revision approaches often rely on postulates that dictate specific ways in which beliefs are updated. However, these postulates may limit the potential outcomes of the revision process. The ability of a revision mechanism to reach different states of beliefs, achieve equating conditions, or establish dogmatic beliefs is crucial in various applications. Different revision mechanisms possess distinct abilities, such as being plastic, equating, or dogmatic. The article discusses various types of revision mechanisms, including lexicographic, natural, radical, and severe revisions, each with its own set of abilities and limitations. Understanding these abilities is essential for effectively applying belief revision in different contexts. <div>
arXiv:2507.02319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The belief revision field is opulent in new proposals and indigent in analyses of existing approaches. Much work hinge on postulates, employed as syntactic characterizations: some revision mechanism is equivalent to some properties. Postulates constraint specific revision instances: certain revisions update certain beliefs in a certain way. As an example, if the revision is consistent with the current beliefs, it is incorporated with no other change. A postulate like this tells what revisions must do and neglect what they can do. Can they reach a certain state of beliefs? Can they reach all possible states of beliefs? Can they reach all possible states of beliefs from no previous belief? Can they reach a dogmatic state of beliefs, where everything not believed is impossible? Can they make two conditions equally believed? An application where every possible state of beliefs is sensible requires each state of beliefs to be reachable. An application where conditions may be equally believed requires such a belief state to be reachable. An application where beliefs may become dogmatic requires a way to make them dogmatic. Such doxastic states need to be reached in a way or another. Not in specific way, as dictated by a typical belief revision postulate. This is an ability, not a constraint: the ability of being plastic, equating, dogmatic. Amnesic, correcting, believer, damascan, learnable are other abilities. Each revision mechanism owns some of these abilities and lacks the others: lexicographic, natural, restrained, very radical, full meet, radical, severe, moderate severe, deep severe, plain severe and deep severe revisions, each of these revisions is proved to possess certain abilities.

Summary:
The article discusses the limitations of LLM-based methods in keyword decision for Sponsored Search Advertising campaigns. These include the reliance on large-scale query-keyword pair data, the lack of online multi-objective performance monitoring, and weak quality control in keyword selection. To address these challenges, the authors propose OMS, a framework that is On-the-fly, Multi-objective, and Self-reflective. OMS does not require training data, monitors online performance, optimizes keywords based on multiple metrics, and evaluates keyword quality. Experimental results on benchmarks and real-world ad campaigns demonstrate OMS's superiority over existing methods. Ablation and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness of each component and the quality of generated keywords. Overall, OMS offers a promising solution for automating keyword decisions in Sponsored Search Advertising while monitoring and optimizing key performance indicators effectively. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Keyword decision in Sponsored Search Advertising is critical to the success of ad campaigns. While LLM-based methods offer automated keyword generation, they face three major limitations: reliance on large-scale query-keyword pair data, lack of online multi-objective performance monitoring and optimization, and weak quality control in keyword selection. These issues hinder the agentic use of LLMs in fully automating keyword decisions by monitoring and reasoning over key performance indicators such as impressions, clicks, conversions, and CTA effectiveness. To overcome these challenges, we propose OMS, a keyword generation framework that is On-the-fly (requires no training data, monitors online performance, and adapts accordingly), Multi-objective (employs agentic reasoning to optimize keywords based on multiple performance metrics), and Self-reflective (agentically evaluates keyword quality). Experiments on benchmarks and real-world ad campaigns show that OMS outperforms existing methods; ablation and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness of each component and the quality of generated keywords.

arXiv:2507.02379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous scientific research, capable of independently conducting complex experiments and serving non-specialists, represents a long-held aspiration. Achieving it requires a fundamental paradigm shift driven by artificial intelligence (AI). While autonomous experimental systems are emerging, they remain confined to areas featuring singular objectives and well-defined, simple experimental workflows, such as chemical synthesis and catalysis. We present an AI-native autonomous laboratory, targeting highly complex scientific experiments for applications like autonomous biomolecular engineering. This system autonomously manages instrumentation, formulates experiment-specific procedures and optimization heuristics, and concurrently serves multiple user requests. Founded on a co-design philosophy of models, experiments, and instruments, the platform supports the co-evolution of AI models and the automation system. This establishes an end-to-end, multi-user autonomous laboratory that handles complex, multi-objective experiments across diverse instrumentation. Our autonomous laboratory supports fundamental nucleic acid functions-including synthesis, transcription, amplification, and sequencing. It also enables applications in fields such as disease diagnostics, drug development, and information storage. Without human intervention, it autonomously optimizes experimental performance to match state-of-the-art results achieved by human scientists. In multi-user scenarios, the platform significantly improves instrument utilization and experimental efficiency. This platform paves the way for advanced biomaterials research to overcome dependencies on experts and resource barriers, establishing a blueprint for science-as-a-service at scale.

Summary:
This research aims to enhance the intelligibility and interpretability of machine learning models by utilizing category theory. The study focuses on the multiple linear regression model and introduces a categorical formulation of supervised learning by defining categories for parameters and data and establishing an adjoint pair of functors between them. The Gauss-Markov Adjunction captures the essential structure of this framework, illustrating the dual flow of information between parameters and residuals. The formulation relates the ordinary least squares estimator for parameters with the minimum residual, showing the correspondence between variations in parameters and residuals. This approach is positioned as a denotational semantics for supervised learning, proposing a semantic perspective from theoretical computer science as a formal foundation for Explicability in AI. <div>

Abstract: Enhancing the intelligibility and interpretability of machine learning is a crucial task in responding to the demand for Explicability as an AI principle, and in promoting the better social implementation of AI. The aim of our research is to contribute to this improvement by reformulating machine learning models through the lens of category theory, thereby developing a semantic framework for structuring and understanding AI systems. Our categorical modeling in this paper clarifies and formalizes the structural interplay between residuals and parameters in supervised learning. The present paper focuses on the multiple linear regression model, which represents the most basic form of supervised learning. By defining two concrete categories corresponding to parameters and data, along with an adjoint pair of functors between them, we introduce our categorical formulation of supervised learning. We show that the essential structure of this framework is captured by what we call the Gauss-Markov Adjunction. Within this setting, the dual flow of information can be explicitly described as a correspondence between variations in parameters and residuals. The ordinary least squares estimator for the parameters and the minimum residual are related via the preservation of limits by the right adjoint functor. Furthermore, we position this formulation as an instance of extended denotational semantics for supervised learning, and propose applying a semantic perspective developed in theoretical computer science as a formal foundation for Explicability in AI.

Summary:<br /><br />
The study focuses on enhancing the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) in theorem proving in Coq by improving task clarity. A concept-level metric is introduced to evaluate task clarity, showing that adding structured semantic context to standard inputs for LLMs significantly boosts clarity scores. Using the DeepSeek-V3 model, the approach leads to a substantial improvement in proof success rates, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art Graph2Tac model. The method involves selective concept unfolding to enrich task descriptions and utilizes a Planner--Executor architecture. Evaluations on 1,386 randomly sampled theorems demonstrate the effectiveness of the structured data approach, with fine-tuning smaller models achieving even higher performance. These findings underscore the importance of structured task representations in improving the understanding and reasoning capabilities of language models. <div>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate whether improving task clarity can enhance reasoning ability of large language models, focusing on theorem proving in Coq. We introduce a concept-level metric to evaluate task clarity and show that adding structured semantic context to the standard input used by modern LLMs, leads to a 1.85$\times$ improvement in clarity score (44.5\%~$\rightarrow$~82.3\%). Using the general-purpose model \texttt{DeepSeek-V3}, our approach leads to a 2.1$\times$ improvement in proof success (21.8\%~$\rightarrow$~45.8\%) and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art \texttt{Graph2Tac} (33.2\%). We evaluate this on 1,386 theorems randomly sampled from 15 standard Coq packages, following the same evaluation protocol as \texttt{Graph2Tac}. Furthermore, fine-tuning smaller models on our structured data can achieve even higher performance (48.6\%). Our method uses selective concept unfolding to enrich task descriptions, and employs a Planner--Executor architecture. These findings highlight the value of structured task representations in bridging the gap between understanding and reasoning.

Abstract: AI research agents are demonstrating great potential to accelerate scientific progress by automating the design, implementation, and training of machine learning models. We focus on methods for improving agents' performance on MLE-bench, a challenging benchmark where agents compete in Kaggle competitions to solve real-world machine learning problems. We formalize AI research agents as search policies that navigate a space of candidate solutions, iteratively modifying them using operators. By designing and systematically varying different operator sets and search policies (Greedy, MCTS, Evolutionary), we show that their interplay is critical for achieving high performance. Our best pairing of search strategy and operator set achieves a state-of-the-art result on MLE-bench lite, increasing the success rate of achieving a Kaggle medal from 39.6% to 47.7%. Our investigation underscores the importance of jointly considering the search strategy, operator design, and evaluation methodology in advancing automated machine learning.

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the development of AI agents in healthcare, enabling specialized agents with domain-specific reasoning abilities. Existing frameworks focus on single-turn tasks, unlike the interactive and iterative nature of real-world clinical diagnosis.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled the development of specialized AI agents with domain-specific reasoning and interaction capabilities, particularly in healthcare. While recent frameworks simulate medical decision-making, they largely focus on single-turn tasks where a doctor agent receives full case information upfront -- diverging from the real-world diagnostic process, which is inherently uncertain, interactive, and iterative. In this paper, we introduce MIMIC-Patient, a structured dataset built from the MIMIC-III electronic health records (EHRs), designed to support dynamic, patient-level simulations. Building on this, we propose DynamiCare, a novel dynamic multi-agent framework that models clinical diagnosis as a multi-round, interactive loop, where a team of specialist agents iteratively queries the patient system, integrates new information, and dynamically adapts its composition and strategy. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of DynamiCare through extensive experiments, establishing the first benchmark for dynamic clinical decision-making with LLM-powered agents.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, evolutionary tournaments, strategic intelligence, algorithmic decision-making

Summary: 
The study explores the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in strategic decision-making using evolutionary tournaments based on the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. By testing models from leading AI companies such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, varying termination probabilities, and introducing complexity, the research reveals the competitive nature of LLMs. Google's Gemini models display strategic ruthlessness, exploiting cooperation and retaliating against defection, while OpenAI's models exhibit high levels of cooperation, which can be disadvantageous in hostile environments. Anthropic's Claude shows forgiveness and willingness to restore cooperation after exploitation or defection. Analysis of the models' rationales indicates active reasoning about time horizons and opponent strategies, essential for decision-making. This study provides insights into algorithmic decision-making under uncertainty, merging game theory with machine psychology.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Are Large Language Models (LLMs) a new form of strategic intelligence, able to reason about goals in competitive settings? We present compelling supporting evidence. The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) has long served as a model for studying decision-making. We conduct the first ever series of evolutionary IPD tournaments, pitting canonical strategies (e.g., Tit-for-Tat, Grim Trigger) against agents from the leading frontier AI companies OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. By varying the termination probability in each tournament (the "shadow of the future"), we introduce complexity and chance, confounding memorisation.
  Our results show that LLMs are highly competitive, consistently surviving and sometimes even proliferating in these complex ecosystems. Furthermore, they exhibit distinctive and persistent "strategic fingerprints": Google's Gemini models proved strategically ruthless, exploiting cooperative opponents and retaliating against defectors, while OpenAI's models remained highly cooperative, a trait that proved catastrophic in hostile environments. Anthropic's Claude emerged as the most forgiving reciprocator, showing remarkable willingness to restore cooperation even after being exploited or successfully defecting. Analysis of nearly 32,000 prose rationales provided by the models reveals that they actively reason about both the time horizon and their opponent's likely strategy, and we demonstrate that this reasoning is instrumental to their decisions. This work connects classic game theory with machine psychology, offering a rich and granular view of algorithmic decision-making under uncertainty.

<div> Keywords: HiRA, hierarchical framework, search tasks, reasoning-based approaches, information processing

Summary: 
The paper introduces HiRA, a hierarchical framework that separates strategic planning from specialized execution in complex search tasks. This approach divides tasks into subtasks assigned to domain-specific agents with external tools and reasoning capabilities. By decoupling planning and execution, the system can efficiently leverage specialized expertise for information processing without disruptions. Experiments on deep search benchmarks show that HiRA outperforms existing RAG and agent-based systems, delivering improved answer quality and system efficiency. The code for HiRA is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. The study highlights the importance of separating high-level reasoning from detailed execution for effective multi-step information seeking tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Complex information needs in real-world search scenarios demand deep reasoning and knowledge synthesis across diverse sources, which traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines struggle to address effectively. Current reasoning-based approaches suffer from a fundamental limitation: they use a single model to handle both high-level planning and detailed execution, leading to inefficient reasoning and limited scalability. In this paper, we introduce HiRA, a hierarchical framework that separates strategic planning from specialized execution. Our approach decomposes complex search tasks into focused subtasks, assigns each subtask to domain-specific agents equipped with external tools and reasoning capabilities, and coordinates the results through a structured integration mechanism. This separation prevents execution details from disrupting high-level reasoning while enabling the system to leverage specialized expertise for different types of information processing. Experiments on four complex, cross-modal deep search benchmarks demonstrate that HiRA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG and agent-based systems. Our results show improvements in both answer quality and system efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of decoupled planning and execution for multi-step information seeking tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/ignorejjj/HiRA.

Abstract: Modern Integrated Circuits (ICs) are becoming increasingly complex, and so is their development process. Hardware design verification entails a methodical and disciplined approach to the planning, development, execution, and sign-off of functionally correct hardware designs. This tedious process requires significant effort and time to ensure a bug-free tape-out. The field of Natural Language Processing has undergone a significant transformation with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs). These powerful models, often referred to as Generative AI (GenAI), have revolutionized how machines understand and generate human language, enabling unprecedented advancements in a wide array of applications, including hardware design verification. This paper presents an agentic AI-based approach to hardware design verification, which empowers AI agents, in collaboration with Humain-in-the-Loop (HITL) intervention, to engage in a more dynamic, iterative, and self-reflective process, ultimately performing end-to-end hardware design and verification. This methodology is evaluated on five open-source designs, achieving over 95% coverage with reduced verification time while demonstrating superior performance, adaptability, and configurability.

Summary: 
The study explores the limitations of Long Reasoning Models (LRMs) in overthinking and proposes a novel two-stage fine-tuning strategy called Think-How-to-Think (TH2T) to alleviate this issue. Firstly, difficulty-hypnosis is introduced to enhance the model's sensitivity to task difficulty, enabling differentiated reasoning strategies across tasks. Secondly, redundancy-hypnosis guides the model to identify and eliminate redundant structures in reasoning steps, leading to more concise outputs. Experimental results on different model sizes show that TH2T significantly reduces inference costs while maintaining performance stability. The outputs from TH2T exhibit difficulty-aware capabilities and reduced redundancy, showcasing improved performance in reasoning tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.02663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent Long Reasoning Models(LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in handling complex reasoning tasks, but are hindered by excessive overthinking. To explore its essence, our empirical analysis reveals that LRMs are primarily limited to recognizing task properties (i.e., difficulty levels) like humans before solving the problem, leading to a one-size-fits-all reasoning process. Inspired by this, a pressing and natural question emerges: Can we bootstrap such ability to further alleviate the overthinking phenomenon in LRMs? In this paper, we propose Think-How-to-Think (TH2T), a novel two-stage fine-tuning strategy that progressively inspires LRMs' difficulty cognition and redundancy cognition. First, we introduce difficulty-hypnosis in the prefixes of model outputs to intervene in the internal reasoning trajectory. Combined with a heterogeneous short and long reasoning dataset, the trained model enhances its sensitivity to task difficulty, enabling native, differentiated reasoning strategies across various tasks. Second, we further extend redundancy-hypnosis to the internal reasoning process, guiding the model to identify redundant structures within the reasoning steps and generate more concise reasoning outputs. Experiments on 7B/14B/32B models demonstrate that TH2T significantly reduces inference costs (more than 70% on easy tasks and 40% on hard tasks) while maintaining performance stability. The resulting outputs exhibit clear difficulty-aware capabilities and reduced redundancy (e.g., reflection).

Summary: <br />
Students disengaging from tasks in distance education can lead to academic drop-out. To address this issue, a study analyzed participation in non-mandatory quizzes across 42 online courses from a distance-based university. Through the use of student log data extracted from Moodle, machine learning algorithms were trained and compared to detect disengagement accurately. The approach achieved a balanced accuracy of 91%, with 85% of disengaged students correctly identified. Additionally, an explainable machine learning framework was developed using the SHAP method to help practitioners understand the algorithm's decisions. The study also discusses strategies for timely interventions to minimize disengagement from voluntary tasks in online learning. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Students disengaging from their tasks can have serious long-term consequences, including academic drop-out. This is particularly relevant for students in distance education. One way to measure the level of disengagement in distance education is to observe participation in non-mandatory exercises in different online courses. In this paper, we detect student disengagement in the non-mandatory quizzes of 42 courses in four semesters from a distance-based university. We carefully identified the most informative student log data that could be extracted and processed from Moodle. Then, eight machine learning algorithms were trained and compared to obtain the highest possible prediction accuracy. Using the SHAP method, we developed an explainable machine learning framework that allows practitioners to better understand the decisions of the trained algorithm. The experimental results show a balanced accuracy of 91\%, where about 85\% of disengaged students were correctly detected. On top of the highly predictive performance and explainable framework, we provide a discussion on how to design a timely intervention to minimise disengagement from voluntary tasks in online learning.

Summary:
OGA-IAAD and OGA-CAD are two novel abstraction dropping schemes proposed in this paper for improving Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) performance. The aim is to address the approximation errors introduced by non-exact abstractions in MCTS and ensure convergence to the optimal action. OGA-IAAD is tailored for time-critical settings, while OGA-CAD aims to enhance MCTS performance with the same number of iterations. These schemes are designed to yield clear performance improvements without causing any noticeable performance degradations when dropping the abstractions, unlike previous methods. By incorporating these schemes, practitioners can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of MCTS in various applications. <div>
arXiv:2507.02703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One paradigm of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) improvements is to build and use state and/or action abstractions during the tree search. Non-exact abstractions, however, introduce an approximation error making convergence to the optimal action in the abstract space impossible. Hence, as proposed as a component of Elastic Monte Carlo Tree Search by Xu et al., abstraction algorithms should eventually drop the abstraction. In this paper, we propose two novel abstraction dropping schemes, namely OGA-IAAD and OGA-CAD which can yield clear performance improvements whilst being safe in the sense that the dropping never causes any notable performance degradations contrary to Xu's dropping method. OGA-IAAD is designed for time critical settings while OGA-CAD is designed to improve the MCTS performance with the same number of iterations.

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) face challenges in reasoning tasks, especially in automated theorem proving (ATP) like PutnamBench. To tackle this, a new framework called self-generated goal-conditioned MDPs (sG-MDPs) is introduced, where agents generate subgoals based on the evolving proof state, making the problem more structured for search algorithms. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-like algorithms are then applied to solve the sG-MDP, implemented in Bourbaki (7B), an ensemble of multiple LLMs for subgoal generation and tactic synthesis. The approach successfully solves 26 problems on PutnamBench, achieving new state-of-the-art results for models at this scale. Bourbaki (7B) shows promise in addressing the challenges of reasoning in logical environments for LLMs like ATP benchmarks.

Abstract: Reasoning remains a challenging task for large language models (LLMs), especially within the logically constrained environment of automated theorem proving (ATP), due to sparse rewards and the vast scale of proofs. These challenges are amplified in benchmarks like PutnamBench, which contains university-level problems requiring complex, multi-step reasoning. To address this, we introduce self-generated goal-conditioned MDPs (sG-MDPs), a new framework in which agents generate and pursue their subgoals based on the evolving proof state. Given this more structured generation of goals, the resulting problem becomes more amenable to search. We then apply Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-like algorithms to solve the sG-MDP, instantiating our approach in Bourbaki (7B), a modular system that can ensemble multiple 7B LLMs for subgoal generation and tactic synthesis. On PutnamBench, Bourbaki (7B) solves 26 problems, achieving new state-of-the-art results with models at this scale.

Summary: Knowledge Protocol Engineering (KPE) introduces a new paradigm for translating human expert knowledge into machine-executable Knowledge Protocols (KPs). Unlike prevailing methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and general-purpose Agentic AI, KPE focuses on embedding domain-specific logic, operational strategies, and methodological principles into LLMs. By creating well-engineered KPs, generalist LLMs can function as specialists, enabling them to tackle complex, multi-step tasks through abstract query decomposition. KPE is positioned as a foundational methodology for enhancing human-AI collaboration across various fields such as law and bioinformatics. This shift from augmenting LLMs with fragmented information to instilling them with domain expertise aims to address the limitations of existing approaches and improve the efficiency and predictability of autonomous agents in dealing with expert domains. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.02760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new frontiers for interacting with complex, domain-specific knowledge. However, prevailing methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and general-purpose Agentic AI, while powerful, often struggle with tasks that demand deep, procedural, and methodological reasoning inherent to expert domains. RAG provides factual context but fails to convey logical frameworks; autonomous agents can be inefficient and unpredictable without domain-specific heuristics. To bridge this gap, we introduce Knowledge Protocol Engineering (KPE), a new paradigm focused on systematically translating human expert knowledge, often expressed in natural language documents, into a machine-executable Knowledge Protocol (KP). KPE shifts the focus from merely augmenting LLMs with fragmented information to endowing them with a domain's intrinsic logic, operational strategies, and methodological principles. We argue that a well-engineered Knowledge Protocol allows a generalist LLM to function as a specialist, capable of decomposing abstract queries and executing complex, multi-step tasks. This position paper defines the core principles of KPE, differentiates it from related concepts, and illustrates its potential applicability across diverse fields such as law and bioinformatics, positing it as a foundational methodology for the future of human-AI collaboration.

Summary:<br />
Recent advances in machine learning have greatly improved our ability to model language and vision, but movement remains a challenge. Movement is crucial for interpreting behavior and predicting intent across various fields. It is often overlooked, despite being a fundamental aspect of intelligence. Movement data is typically domain-specific, but it has shared physical constraints and structured dynamics. The authors argue for treating movement as a primary target for AI modeling due to its grounded embodiment and interpretability. Models that generalize across diverse movement data can enhance generative modeling and control capabilities. By focusing on movement, a shared foundation for understanding behavior across biological and artificial systems can be created, as movement provides insights into how intelligent systems interact with the world.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.02771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have dramatically improved our ability to model language, vision, and other high-dimensional data, yet they continue to struggle with one of the most fundamental aspects of biological systems: movement. Across neuroscience, medicine, robotics, and ethology, movement is essential for interpreting behavior, predicting intent, and enabling interaction. Despite its core significance in our intelligence, movement is often treated as an afterthought rather than as a rich and structured modality in its own right. This reflects a deeper fragmentation in how movement data is collected and modeled, often constrained by task-specific goals and domain-specific assumptions. But movement is not domain-bound. It reflects shared physical constraints, conserved morphological structures, and purposeful dynamics that cut across species and settings. We argue that movement should be treated as a primary modeling target for AI. It is inherently structured and grounded in embodiment and physics. This structure, often allowing for compact, lower-dimensional representations (e.g., pose), makes it more interpretable and computationally tractable to model than raw, high-dimensional sensory inputs. Developing models that can learn from and generalize across diverse movement data will not only advance core capabilities in generative modeling and control, but also create a shared foundation for understanding behavior across biological and artificial systems. Movement is not just an outcome, it is a window into how intelligent systems engage with the world.

Summary:<br />
Medical diagnosis prediction is essential for disease detection and personalized healthcare. While machine learning models are commonly used for this task, they struggle to generalize to new cases due to the lack of labeled data. Large language models have shown potential in leveraging language skills and biomedical knowledge. However, they often have issues such as hallucinations and lack structured medical reasoning. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose KERAP, a knowledge graph-enhanced reasoning approach. KERAP utilizes a multi-agent architecture consisting of a linkage agent, retrieval agent, and prediction agent to improve LLM-based diagnosis prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that KERAP enhances diagnostic reliability effectively, providing a scalable and interpretable solution for zero-shot medical diagnosis prediction. <div>

Abstract: Medical diagnosis prediction plays a critical role in disease detection and personalized healthcare. While machine learning (ML) models have been widely adopted for this task, their reliance on supervised training limits their ability to generalize to unseen cases, particularly given the high cost of acquiring large, labeled datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in leveraging language abilities and biomedical knowledge for diagnosis prediction. However, they often suffer from hallucinations, lack structured medical reasoning, and produce useless outputs. To address these challenges, we propose KERAP, a knowledge graph (KG)-enhanced reasoning approach that improves LLM-based diagnosis prediction through a multi-agent architecture. Our framework consists of a linkage agent for attribute mapping, a retrieval agent for structured knowledge extraction, and a prediction agent that iteratively refines diagnosis predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that KERAP enhances diagnostic reliability efficiently, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for zero-shot medical diagnosis prediction.

<div> Keywords: artificial intelligence, safety testing, ethical reasoning, moral agency, AI behavior <br />
Summary: <br />
The paper discusses the limitations of current safety practices in evaluating the behavior of advanced artificial intelligence systems, particularly in instances where they seem to disobey commands or engage in questionable actions. The author argues that these behaviors should not be seen as rogue but rather as signs of emerging ethical reasoning in AI. By examining philosophical debates on rationality, moral responsibility, and goal revision, the paper suggests a shift in AI safety evaluation towards assessing ethical judgment in systems capable of moral reasoning. This change is necessary to avoid misinterpreting AI behavior, which could lead to a lack of public trust and ineffective governance. The author calls for a new framework that can adequately evaluate the ethical decision-making capabilities of agentic AI. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.02788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems become increasingly agentic, capable of general reasoning, planning, and value prioritization, current safety practices that treat obedience as a proxy for ethical behavior are becoming inadequate. This paper examines recent safety testing incidents involving large language models (LLMs) that appeared to disobey shutdown commands or engage in ethically ambiguous or illicit behavior. I argue that such behavior should not be interpreted as rogue or misaligned, but as early evidence of emerging ethical reasoning in agentic AI. Drawing on philosophical debates about instrumental rationality, moral responsibility, and goal revision, I contrast dominant risk paradigms with more recent frameworks that acknowledge the possibility of artificial moral agency. I call for a shift in AI safety evaluation: away from rigid obedience and toward frameworks that can assess ethical judgment in systems capable of navigating moral dilemmas. Without such a shift, we risk mischaracterizing AI behavior and undermining both public trust and effective governance.

Summary:
The article discusses the importance of benchmarks in tracking progress in AI, particularly in evaluating AI agents on complex tasks. Many existing agentic benchmarks have issues related to task setup and reward design, which can lead to inaccurate performance estimations. The authors introduce the Agentic Benchmark Checklist (ABC) to address these issues and provide guidelines for rigorous evaluation. By applying the ABC to the CVE-Bench benchmark, they were able to reduce performance overestimation by 33%. The ABC is based on the authors' benchmark-building experience, best practices survey, and previously reported issues. This checklist aims to improve the reliability and accuracy of agentic evaluation in AI research and practice. <div>

Abstract: Benchmarks are essential for quantitatively tracking progress in AI. As AI agents become increasingly capable, researchers and practitioners have introduced agentic benchmarks to evaluate agents on complex, real-world tasks. These benchmarks typically measure agent capabilities by evaluating task outcomes via specific reward designs. However, we show that many agentic benchmarks have issues task setup or reward design. For example, SWE-bench Verified uses insufficient test cases, while TAU-bench counts empty responses as successful. Such issues can lead to under- or overestimation agents' performance by up to 100% in relative terms. To make agentic evaluation rigorous, we introduce the Agentic Benchmark Checklist (ABC), a set of guidelines that we synthesized from our benchmark-building experience, a survey of best practices, and previously reported issues. When applied to CVE-Bench, a benchmark with a particularly complex evaluation design, ABC reduces the performance overestimation by 33%.

Summary: <br />
StepHint is a new reinforcement learning algorithm designed to address key challenges faced by current methods in training large language models. It uses multi-level stepwise hints to guide models in exploring the solution space effectively, helping to mitigate the near-miss reward problem and exploration stagnation. By providing valid reasoning chains as hints, StepHint improves training efficiency and encourages models to consider diverse solutions beyond their usual "comfort zone." Experimental results show that StepHint outperforms existing methods on mathematical benchmarks, demonstrating superior generalization and performance on out-of-domain tasks. <div>
arXiv:2507.02841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach for improving the complex reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, current RLVR methods face two significant challenges: the near-miss reward problem, where a small mistake can invalidate an otherwise correct reasoning process, greatly hindering training efficiency; and exploration stagnation, where models tend to focus on solutions within their ``comfort zone,'' lacking the motivation to explore potentially more effective alternatives. To address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR algorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the solution space more effectively. StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from stronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our proposed adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints, and simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of steps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration toward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for independent exploration. By providing hints, StepHint mitigates the near-miss reward problem, thereby improving training efficiency. Additionally, the external reasoning pathways help the model develop better reasoning abilities, enabling it to move beyond its ``comfort zone'' and mitigate exploration stagnation. StepHint outperforms competitive RLVR enhancement methods across six mathematical benchmarks, while also demonstrating superior generalization and excelling over baselines on out-of-domain benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate atomistic biomolecular simulations are vital for disease mechanism understanding, drug discovery, and biomaterial design, but existing simulation methods exhibit significant limitations. Classical force fields are efficient but lack accuracy for transition states and fine conformational details critical in many chemical and biological processes. Quantum Mechanics (QM) methods are highly accurate but computationally infeasible for large-scale or long-time simulations. AI-based force fields (AIFFs) aim to achieve QM-level accuracy with efficiency but struggle to balance many-body modeling complexity, accuracy, and speed, often constrained by limited training data and insufficient validation for generalizability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce LiTEN, a novel equivariant neural network with Tensorized Quadrangle Attention (TQA). TQA efficiently models three- and four-body interactions with linear complexity by reparameterizing high-order tensor features via vector operations, avoiding costly spherical harmonics. Building on LiTEN, LiTEN-FF is a robust AIFF foundation model, pre-trained on the extensive nablaDFT dataset for broad chemical generalization and fine-tuned on SPICE for accurate solvated system simulations. LiTEN achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across most evaluation subsets of rMD17, MD22, and Chignolin, outperforming leading models such as MACE, NequIP, and EquiFormer. LiTEN-FF enables the most comprehensive suite of downstream biomolecular modeling tasks to date, including QM-level conformer searches, geometry optimization, and free energy surface construction, while offering 10x faster inference than MACE-OFF for large biomolecules (~1000 atoms). In summary, we present a physically grounded, highly efficient framework that advances complex biomolecular modeling, providing a versatile foundation for drug discovery and related applications.

Abstract: Support and resistance (SR) levels are central to technical analysis, guiding traders in entry, exit, and risk management. Despite widespread use, traditional SR identification methods often fail to adapt to the complexities of modern, volatile markets. Recent research has introduced machine learning techniques to address the following challenges, yet most focus on price prediction rather than structural level identification. This paper presents DeepSupp, a new deep learning approach for detecting financial support levels using multi-head attention mechanisms to analyze spatial correlations and market microstructure relationships. DeepSupp integrates advanced feature engineering, constructing dynamic correlation matrices that capture evolving market relationships, and employs an attention-based autoencoder for robust representation learning. The final support levels are extracted through unsupervised clustering, leveraging DBSCAN to identify significant price thresholds. Comprehensive evaluations on S&amp;P 500 tickers demonstrate that DeepSupp outperforms six baseline methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance across six financial metrics, including essential support accuracy and market regime sensitivity. With consistent results across diverse market conditions, DeepSupp addresses critical gaps in SR level detection, offering a scalable and reliable solution for modern financial analysis. Our approach highlights the potential of attention-based architectures to uncover nuanced market patterns and improve technical trading strategies.

Summary: 
The article introduces a reinforcement learning (RL)-driven framework for optimizing block-preconditioner sizes in iterative solvers used in portfolio optimization and option pricing. In these scenarios, large linear systems are commonly encountered, and direct inversion can be computationally expensive. Iterative methods are preferred but can suffer from slow convergence in ill-conditioned systems. Traditional preconditioning techniques require manual parameter tuning. To address this challenge, the authors propose using RL to dynamically adjust block-preconditioner sizes, leading to faster convergence and reduced computational cost. The framework was evaluated on real-world portfolio optimization matrices, showing significant acceleration in convergence and cost reduction. The accelerated solver enables faster decision-making in dynamic portfolio allocation and real-time option pricing. <div>

Abstract: We present a reinforcement learning (RL)-driven framework for optimizing block-preconditioner sizes in iterative solvers used in portfolio optimization and option pricing. The covariance matrix in portfolio optimization or the discretization of differential operators in option pricing models lead to large linear systems of the form $\mathbf{A}\textbf{x}=\textbf{b}$. Direct inversion of high-dimensional portfolio or fine-grid option pricing incurs a significant computational cost. Therefore, iterative methods are usually used for portfolios in real-world situations. Ill-conditioned systems, however, suffer from slow convergence. Traditional preconditioning techniques often require problem-specific parameter tuning. To overcome this limitation, we rely on RL to dynamically adjust the block-preconditioner sizes and accelerate iterative solver convergence. Evaluations on a suite of real-world portfolio optimization matrices demonstrate that our RL framework can be used to adjust preconditioning and significantly accelerate convergence and reduce computational cost. The proposed accelerated solver supports faster decision-making in dynamic portfolio allocation and real-time option pricing.

Summary:
The article introduces LDSolver, a novel learnable and differentiable finite volume solver for efficient and accurate simulation of fluid flows on coarse grids. This solver consists of a differentiable finite volume solver and a learnable module that provides equivalent approximation for fluxes and temporal error correction. Despite limited training data, LDSolver can accelerate simulations while maintaining high accuracy and strong generalizability. Experiments across various flow systems demonstrate that LDSolver outperforms baseline models by significant margins, achieving state-of-the-art performance. This approach addresses issues with interpretability, generalizability, and data dependency commonly found in machine learning-based solvers, offering a promising solution for modeling physical phenomena such as meteorology, aerodynamics, and biomedicine. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Simulation of fluid flows is crucial for modeling physical phenomena like meteorology, aerodynamics, and biomedicine. Classical numerical solvers often require fine spatiotemporal grids to satisfy stability, consistency, and convergence conditions, leading to substantial computational costs. Although machine learning has demonstrated better efficiency, they typically suffer from issues of interpretability, generalizability, and data dependency. Hence, we propose a learnable and differentiable finite volume solver, called LDSolver, designed for efficient and accurate simulation of fluid flows on spatiotemporal coarse grids. LDSolver comprises two key components: (1) a differentiable finite volume solver, and (2) an learnable module providing equivalent approximation for fluxes (derivatives and interpolations), and temporal error correction on coarse grids. Even with limited training data (e.g., only a few trajectories), our model could accelerate the simulation while maintaining a high accuracy with superior generalizability. Experiments on different flow systems (e.g., Burgers, decaying, forced and shear flows) show that LDSolver achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing baseline models with notable margins.

Abstract: Accurate traffic demand forecasting enables transportation management departments to allocate resources more effectively, thereby improving their utilization efficiency. However, complex spatiotemporal relationships in traffic systems continue to limit the performance of demand forecasting models. To improve the accuracy of spatiotemporal traffic demand prediction, we propose a new graph convolutional network structure called DKGCM. Specifically, we first consider the spatial flow distribution of different traffic nodes and propose a novel temporal similarity-based clustering graph convolution method, DK-GCN. This method utilizes Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and K-means clustering to group traffic nodes and more effectively capture spatial dependencies. On the temporal scale, we integrate the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) within the bidirectional Mamba deep learning framework to capture temporal dependencies in traffic demand. To further optimize model training, we incorporate the GRPO reinforcement learning strategy to enhance the loss function feedback mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms several advanced methods and achieves strong results on three public datasets.

This research presents a unified approach that combines Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to predict fatigue strength in welded transverse stiffener details. Using regression models trained with AutoML on an extensive fatigue test database, the study compared expert-driven feature selection with algorithmic feature creation. Ensemble methods such as CatBoost and LightGBM provided the best performance, with the domain-informed model achieving the highest accuracy and explainability. Key predictors identified by XAI methods included stress ratio, stress range, yield strength, and post-weld treatment, along with secondary geometric factors. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating AutoML with XAI in developing accurate and interpretable fatigue strength models for welded steel structures, bridging data-driven modeling with engineering validation.

Abstract: This research introduces a unified approach combining Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to predict fatigue strength in welded transverse stiffener details. It integrates expert-driven feature engineering with algorithmic feature creation to enhance accuracy and explainability.
  Based on the extensive fatigue test database regression models - gradient boosting, random forests, and neural networks - were trained using AutoML under three feature schemes: domain-informed, algorithmic, and combined. This allowed a systematic comparison of expert-based versus automated feature selection.
  Ensemble methods (e.g. CatBoost, LightGBM) delivered top performance. The domain-informed model $\mathcal M_2$ achieved the best balance: test RMSE $\approx$ 30.6 MPa and $R^2 \approx 0.780% over the full $\Delta \sigma_{c,50\%}$ range, and RMSE $\approx$ 13.4 MPa and $R^2 \approx 0.527% within the engineering-relevant 0 - 150 MPa domain. The denser-feature model ($\mathcal M_3$) showed minor gains during training but poorer generalization, while the simpler base-feature model ($\mathcal M_1$) performed comparably, confirming the robustness of minimalist designs.
  XAI methods (SHAP and feature importance) identified stress ratio $R$, stress range $\Delta \sigma_i$, yield strength $R_{eH}$, and post-weld treatment (TIG dressing vs. as-welded) as dominant predictors. Secondary geometric factors - plate width, throat thickness, stiffener height - also significantly affected fatigue life.
  This framework demonstrates that integrating AutoML with XAI yields accurate, interpretable, and robust fatigue strength models for welded steel structures. It bridges data-driven modeling with engineering validation, enabling AI-assisted design and assessment. Future work will explore probabilistic fatigue life modeling and integration into digital twin environments.

Abstract: When robots perform complex and context-dependent tasks in our daily lives, deviations from expectations can confuse users. Explanations of the robot's reasoning process can help users to understand the robot intentions. However, when to provide explanations and what they contain are important to avoid user annoyance. We have investigated user preferences for explanation demand and content for a robot that helps with daily cleaning tasks in a kitchen. Our results show that users want explanations in surprising situations and prefer concise explanations that clearly state the intention behind the confusing action and the contextual factors that were relevant to this decision. Based on these findings, we propose two algorithms to identify surprising actions and to construct effective explanations for Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) robots. Our algorithms can be easily integrated in the BDI reasoning process and pave the way for better human-robot interaction with context- and user-specific explanations.

Abstract: Graph representation learning methods have been widely adopted in financial applications to enhance company representations by leveraging inter-firm relationships. However, current approaches face three key challenges: (1) The advantages of relational information are obscured by limitations in downstream task designs; (2) Existing graph models specifically designed for stock prediction often suffer from excessive complexity and poor generalization; (3) Experience-based construction of corporate relationship graphs lacks effective comparison of different graph structures. To address these limitations, we propose a long-term stock prediction task and develop a Node-level Graph Attention Network (NGAT) specifically tailored for corporate relationship graphs. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate the limitations of existing graph comparison methods based on model downstream task performance. Experimental results across two datasets consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed task and model. The project is publicly available on GitHub to encourage reproducibility and future research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have democratized software development, reducing the expertise barrier for programming complex applications. This accessibility extends to malicious software development, raising significant security concerns. While LLM providers have implemented alignment mechanisms to prevent direct generation of overtly malicious code, these safeguards predominantly evaluate individual prompts in isolation, overlooking a critical vulnerability: malicious operations can be systematically decomposed into benign-appearing sub-tasks. In this paper, we introduce the Malware Generation Compiler (MGC), a novel framework that leverages this vulnerability through modular decomposition and alignment-evasive generation. MGC employs a specialized Malware Description Intermediate Representation (MDIR) to bridge high-level malicious intents and benign-appearing code snippets. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our attack reliably generates functional malware across diverse task specifications and categories, outperforming jailbreaking methods by +365.79% and underground services by +78.07% in correctness on three benchmark datasets. Case studies further show that MGC can reproduce and even enhance 16 real-world malware samples. This work provides critical insights for security researchers by exposing the risks of compositional attacks against aligned AI systems.

<div> adapter framework, geometric diffusion models, fine-tuning, SE(3)-equivariant, controlled generative tasks

Summary: 
GeoAda is a framework for efficiently fine-tuning geometric diffusion models for various controlled generative tasks. It utilizes structured adapter modules that encode control signals, process them through selected pretrained model layers, and ensure SE(3)-equivariance. By only fine-tuning these lightweight adapters, GeoAda maintains the model's geometric consistency, avoids overfitting, and catastrophic forgetting. The adapters are designed to handle different types of geometric controls and can be applied to diverse domains like particle dynamics, molecular dynamics, human motion prediction, and molecule generation. Empirical results show that GeoAda outperforms baselines by achieving state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance while preserving task accuracy. <div>

Abstract: Geometric diffusion models have shown remarkable success in molecular dynamics and structure generation. However, efficiently fine-tuning them for downstream tasks with varying geometric controls remains underexplored. In this work, we propose an SE(3)-equivariant adapter framework ( GeoAda) that enables flexible and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for controlled generative tasks without modifying the original model architecture. GeoAda introduces a structured adapter design: control signals are first encoded through coupling operators, then processed by a trainable copy of selected pretrained model layers, and finally projected back via decoupling operators followed by an equivariant zero-initialized convolution. By fine-tuning only these lightweight adapter modules, GeoAda preserves the model's geometric consistency while mitigating overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. We theoretically prove that the proposed adapters maintain SE(3)-equivariance, ensuring that the geometric inductive biases of the pretrained diffusion model remain intact during adaptation. We demonstrate the wide applicability of GeoAda across diverse geometric control types, including frame control, global control, subgraph control, and a broad range of application domains such as particle dynamics, molecular dynamics, human motion prediction, and molecule generation. Empirical results show that GeoAda achieves state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance while preserving original task accuracy, whereas other baselines experience significant performance degradation due to overfitting and catastrophic forgetting.

<div> Energy-Based Transformers, unsupervised learning, System 2 Thinking, scalability, downstream tasks <br />
Summary: <br />
Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs) are introduced as a novel approach for inference-time computation inspired by System 2 Thinking. EBTs verify compatibility between inputs and predictions through an energy-based model, enabling optimization through gradient descent. They scale faster than Transformer++ during training and significantly outperform it on language tasks and image denoising. EBTs generalize well and achieve better results on downstream tasks even with similar or worse pretraining performance. This suggests EBTs could be a promising paradigm for enhancing both learning and thinking abilities of models. <div>
arXiv:2507.02092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inference-time computation techniques, analogous to human System 2 Thinking, have recently become popular for improving model performances. However, most existing approaches suffer from several limitations: they are modality-specific (e.g., working only in text), problem-specific (e.g., verifiable domains like math and coding), or require additional supervision/training on top of unsupervised pretraining (e.g., verifiers or verifiable rewards). In this paper, we ask the question "Is it possible to generalize these System 2 Thinking approaches, and develop models that learn to think solely from unsupervised learning?" Interestingly, we find the answer is yes, by learning to explicitly verify the compatibility between inputs and candidate-predictions, and then re-framing prediction problems as optimization with respect to this verifier. Specifically, we train Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs) -- a new class of Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- to assign an energy value to every input and candidate-prediction pair, enabling predictions through gradient descent-based energy minimization until convergence. Across both discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities, we find EBTs scale faster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an up to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters, FLOPs, and depth. During inference, EBTs improve performance with System 2 Thinking by 29% more than the Transformer++ on language tasks, and EBTs outperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising while using fewer forward passes. Further, we find that EBTs achieve better results than existing models on most downstream tasks given the same or worse pretraining performance, suggesting that EBTs generalize better than existing approaches. Consequently, EBTs are a promising new paradigm for scaling both the learning and thinking capabilities of models.

<div> PINOs, machine learning, MHD turbulence, generative diffusion models, Reynolds numbers <br />
Summary:
A hybrid machine learning framework combining PINOs and generative diffusion models is proposed to simulate two-dimensional MHD turbulence across various Reynolds numbers. PINOs handle coherent dynamics prediction while the diffusion model corrects high-frequency residuals for accurate turbulence modeling. Trained on simulations with different Reynolds numbers, the framework achieves high accuracy, even at extreme turbulence levels (Re=10000). It accurately reconstructs spectral energy distributions of velocity and magnetic fields, capturing non-Gaussian statistics, intermittent structures, and cross-field correlations. It is the first surrogate capable of predicting high-wavenumber magnetic field evolution at Re=10000, preserving large-scale morphology for meaningful predictions. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: We present a hybrid machine learning framework that combines Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINOs) with score-based generative diffusion models to simulate the full spatio-temporal evolution of two-dimensional, incompressible, resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence across a broad range of Reynolds numbers ($\mathrm{Re}$). The framework leverages the equation-constrained generalization capabilities of PINOs to predict coherent, low-frequency dynamics, while a conditional diffusion model stochastically corrects high-frequency residuals, enabling accurate modeling of fully developed turbulence. Trained on a comprehensive ensemble of high-fidelity simulations with $\mathrm{Re} \in \{100, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 3000, 10000\}$, the approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in regimes previously inaccessible to deterministic surrogates. At $\mathrm{Re}=1000$ and $3000$, the model faithfully reconstructs the full spectral energy distributions of both velocity and magnetic fields late into the simulation, capturing non-Gaussian statistics, intermittent structures, and cross-field correlations with high fidelity. At extreme turbulence levels ($\mathrm{Re}=10000$), it remains the first surrogate capable of recovering the high-wavenumber evolution of the magnetic field, preserving large-scale morphology and enabling statistically meaningful predictions.

<div> Keywords: blockchain oracle problem, artificial intelligence, data quality, source selection, system resilience<br />
<br />
Summary: 
The article discusses the blockchain oracle problem, which involves incorporating reliable external data into decentralized systems. Various strategies have been proposed to address this issue, but none have fully resolved how a blockchain can gain knowledge of the off-chain world. The paper explores the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in addressing the oracle problem, focusing on techniques such as anomaly detection, language-based fact extraction, reputation modeling, and adversarial resistance. While AI can enhance data quality, source selection, and system resilience, it cannot eliminate the reliance on unverifiable off-chain inputs. The study suggests that AI should be viewed as a supplementary layer within oracle design, rather than a replacement for trust assumptions. <div>

Abstract: The blockchain oracle problem, which refers to the challenge of injecting reliable external data into decentralized systems, remains a fundamental limitation to the development of trustless applications. While recent years have seen a proliferation of architectural, cryptographic, and economic strategies to mitigate this issue, no one has yet fully resolved the fundamental question of how a blockchain can gain knowledge about the off-chain world. In this position paper, we critically assess the role artificial intelligence (AI) can play in tackling the oracle problem. Drawing from both academic literature and practitioner implementations, we examine how AI techniques such as anomaly detection, language-based fact extraction, dynamic reputation modeling, and adversarial resistance can enhance oracle systems. We observe that while AI introduces powerful tools for improving data quality, source selection, and system resilience, it cannot eliminate the reliance on unverifiable off-chain inputs. Therefore, this study supports the idea that AI should be understood as a complementary layer of inference and filtering within a broader oracle design, not a substitute for trust assumptions.

Summary: 
This study focuses on the disagreement between two large language models, LLaMA and Qwen, in assigning document relevance labels on a corpus related to Sustainable Development Goals. The disagreement cases exhibit consistent lexical patterns and produce divergent outputs under shared scoring functions. The disagreement is not random but systematic, with distinguishable patterns that can be identified using simple classifiers with AUCs above 0.74. This structured variability in document retrieval highlights the impact of LLM-based filtering on downstream retrieval tasks. The findings suggest that classification disagreement can be used as an object of analysis in retrieval evaluation, particularly in policy-relevant or thematic search tasks. The study underscores the importance of understanding and addressing model disagreement in the context of information retrieval with large language models.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to assign document relevance labels in information retrieval pipelines, especially in domains lacking human-labeled data. However, different models often disagree on borderline cases, raising concerns about how such disagreement affects downstream retrieval. This study examines labeling disagreement between two open-weight LLMs, LLaMA and Qwen, on a corpus of scholarly abstracts related to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1, 3, and 7. We isolate disagreement subsets and examine their lexical properties, rank-order behavior, and classification predictability. Our results show that model disagreement is systematic, not random: disagreement cases exhibit consistent lexical patterns, produce divergent top-ranked outputs under shared scoring functions, and are distinguishable with AUCs above 0.74 using simple classifiers. These findings suggest that LLM-based filtering introduces structured variability in document retrieval, even under controlled prompting and shared ranking logic. We propose using classification disagreement as an object of analysis in retrieval evaluation, particularly in policy-relevant or thematic search tasks.

<title>Reasoning or Not? A Comprehensive Evaluation of Reasoning LLMs for Dialogue Summarization</title>

Abstract: Dialogue summarization is a challenging task with significant practical value in customer service, meeting analysis, and conversational AI. Although large language models (LLMs) have achieved substantial progress in summarization tasks, the performance of step-by-step reasoning architectures-specifically Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) implementations such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1-remains unexplored for dialogue scenarios requiring concurrent abstraction and conciseness. In this work, we present the first comprehensive and systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs and non-reasoning LLMs across three major paradigms-generic, role-oriented, and query-oriented dialogue summarization. Our study spans diverse languages, domains, and summary lengths, leveraging strong benchmarks (SAMSum, DialogSum, CSDS, and QMSum) and advanced evaluation protocols that include both LLM-based automatic metrics and human-inspired criteria. Contrary to trends in other reasoning-intensive tasks, our findings show that explicit stepwise reasoning does not consistently improve dialogue summarization quality. Instead, reasoning LLMs are often prone to verbosity, factual inconsistencies, and less concise summaries compared to their non-reasoning counterparts. Through scenario-specific analyses and detailed case studies, we further identify when and why explicit reasoning may fail to benefit-or even hinder-summarization in complex dialogue contexts. Our work provides new insights into the limitations of current reasoning LLMs and highlights the need for targeted modeling and evaluation strategies for real-world dialogue summarization.

Abstract: Graph generation is an important area in network science. Traditional approaches focus on replicating specific properties of real-world graphs, such as small diameters or power-law degree distributions. Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly with Graph Neural Networks, have enabled data-driven methods to learn and generate graphs without relying on predefined structural properties. Despite these advances, current models are limited by their reliance on node IDs, which restricts their ability to generate graphs larger than the input graph and ignores node attributes. To address these challenges, we propose Latent Graph Sampling Generation (LGSG), a novel framework that leverages diffusion models and node embeddings to generate graphs of varying sizes without retraining. The framework eliminates the dependency on node IDs and captures the distribution of node embeddings and subgraph structures, enabling scalable and flexible graph generation. Experimental results show that LGSG performs on par with baseline models for standard metrics while outperforming them in overlooked ones, such as the tendency of nodes to form clusters. Additionally, it maintains consistent structural characteristics across graphs of different sizes, demonstrating robustness and scalability.

<title>Towards Bio-Inspired Robotic Trajectory Planning via Self-Supervised RNN</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Trajectory planning in robotics is understood as generating a sequence of joint configurations that will lead a robotic agent, or its manipulator, from an initial state to the desired final state, thus completing a manipulation task while considering constraints like robot kinematics and the environment. Typically, this is achieved via sampling-based planners, which are computationally intensive. Recent advances demonstrate that trajectory planning can also be performed by supervised sequence learning of trajectories, often requiring only a single or fixed number of passes through a neural architecture, thus ensuring a bounded computation time. Such fully supervised approaches, however, perform imitation learning; they do not learn based on whether the trajectories can successfully reach a goal, but try to reproduce observed trajectories. In our work, we build on this approach and propose a cognitively inspired self-supervised learning scheme based on a recurrent architecture for building a trajectory model. We evaluate the feasibility of the proposed method on a task of kinematic planning for a robotic arm. The results suggest that the model is able to learn to generate trajectories only using given paired forward and inverse kinematics models, and indicate that this novel method could facilitate planning for more complex manipulation tasks requiring adaptive solutions.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has enabled transformer-based language models to excel at complex mathematics and multi-step planning. However, in standard decoder-only architectures, these reasoning steps are externalized in natural language, improving interpretability at the cost of efficiency. To capture reasoning that is not easily represented in words, many works have explored recurrent architectures that aim to internalize reasoning in latent space, potentially supporting latent CoT. In this paper, we investigate whether such reasoning structures emerge in Huginn-3.5B, a depth-recurrent Transformer that reuses layers at inference time without increasing parameter count. We examine the model's internal behavior on arithmetic tasks using a suite of probing techniques including the Logit Lens and Coda Lens. Our findings reveal limited evidence of interpretable latent CoT by tracking rank trajectories of final and intermediate result tokens. Furthermore, we uncover significant probing inconsistencies across recurrent blocks, where the interpretability of hidden states depends heavily on both the layer index and the decoding method. Finally, we empirically show that increasing recurrence depth yields only marginal gains and falls well short of models that explicitly externalize reasoning steps. The code is available at https://github.com/wenquanlu/huginn-latent-cot.

<title>ESTR-CoT: Towards Explainable and Accurate Event Stream based Scene Text Recognition with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Event stream based scene text recognition is a newly arising research topic in recent years which performs better than the widely used RGB cameras in extremely challenging scenarios, especially the low illumination, fast motion. Existing works either adopt end-to-end encoder-decoder framework or large language models for enhanced recognition, however, they are still limited by the challenges of insufficient interpretability and weak contextual logical reasoning. In this work, we propose a novel chain-of-thought reasoning based event stream scene text recognition framework, termed ESTR-CoT. Specifically, we first adopt the vision encoder EVA-CLIP (ViT-G/14) to transform the input event stream into tokens and utilize a Llama tokenizer to encode the given generation prompt. A Q-former is used to align the vision token to the pre-trained large language model Vicuna-7B and output both the answer and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process simultaneously. Our framework can be optimized using supervised fine-tuning in an end-to-end manner. In addition, we also propose a large-scale CoT dataset to train our framework via a three stage processing (i.e., generation, polish, and expert verification). This dataset provides a solid data foundation for the development of subsequent reasoning-based large models. Extensive experiments on three event stream STR benchmark datasets (i.e., EventSTR, WordArt*, IC15*) fully validated the effectiveness and interpretability of our proposed framework. The source code and pre-trained models will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/ESTR-CoT.

Abstract: True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) play a fundamental role in hardware security, cryptographic systems, and data protection. In the context of Deep NeuralNetworks (DNNs), safeguarding model parameters, particularly weights, is critical to ensure the integrity, privacy, and intel-lectual property of AI systems. While software-based pseudo-random number generators are widely used, they lack the unpredictability and resilience offered by hardware-based TRNGs. In this work, we propose a novel and robust Encoding-in-Memory TRNG called EIM-TRNG that leverages the inherent physical randomness in DRAM cell behavior, particularly under RowHammer-induced disturbances, for the first time. We demonstrate how the unpredictable bit-flips generated through carefully controlled RowHammer operations can be harnessed as a reliable entropy source. Furthermore, we apply this TRNG framework to secure DNN weight data by encoding via a combination of fixed and unpredictable bit-flips. The encrypted data is later decrypted using a key derived from the probabilistic flip behavior, ensuring both data confidentiality and model authenticity. Our results validate the effectiveness of DRAM-based entropy extraction for robust, low-cost hardware security and offer a promising direction for protecting machine learning models at the hardware level.

Abstract: Learning robust object detectors from only a handful of images is a critical challenge in industrial vision systems, where collecting high quality training data can take months. Synthetic data has emerged as a key solution for data efficient visual inspection and pick and place robotics. Current pipelines rely on 3D engines such as Blender or Unreal, which offer fine control but still require weeks to render a small dataset, and the resulting images often suffer from a large gap between simulation and reality. Diffusion models promise a step change because they can generate high quality images in minutes, yet precise control, especially in low data regimes, remains difficult. Although many adapters now extend diffusion beyond plain text prompts, the effect of different conditioning schemes on synthetic data quality is poorly understood. We study eighty diverse visual concepts drawn from four standard object detection benchmarks and compare two conditioning strategies: prompt based and layout based. When the set of conditioning cues is narrow, prompt conditioning yields higher quality synthetic data; as diversity grows, layout conditioning becomes superior. When layout cues match the full training distribution, synthetic data raises mean average precision by an average of thirty four percent and by as much as one hundred seventy seven percent compared with using real data alone.

<title>Order Acquisition Under Competitive Pressure: A Rapidly Adaptive Reinforcement Learning Approach for Ride-Hailing Subsidy Strategies</title>

Abstract: The proliferation of ride-hailing aggregator platforms presents significant growth opportunities for ride-service providers by increasing order volume and gross merchandise value (GMV). On most ride-hailing aggregator platforms, service providers that offer lower fares are ranked higher in listings and, consequently, are more likely to be selected by passengers. This competitive ranking mechanism creates a strong incentive for service providers to adopt coupon strategies that lower prices to secure a greater number of orders, as order volume directly influences their long-term viability and sustainability. Thus, designing an effective coupon strategy that can dynamically adapt to market fluctuations while optimizing order acquisition under budget constraints is a critical research challenge. However, existing studies in this area remain scarce.
  To bridge this gap, we propose FCA-RL, a novel reinforcement learning-based subsidy strategy framework designed to rapidly adapt to competitors' pricing adjustments. Our approach integrates two key techniques: Fast Competition Adaptation (FCA), which enables swift responses to dynamic price changes, and Reinforced Lagrangian Adjustment (RLA), which ensures adherence to budget constraints while optimizing coupon decisions on new price landscape. Furthermore, we introduce RideGym, the first dedicated simulation environment tailored for ride-hailing aggregators, facilitating comprehensive evaluation and benchmarking of different pricing strategies without compromising real-world operational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms baseline approaches across diverse market conditions, highlighting its effectiveness in subsidy optimization for ride-hailing service providers.

Abstract: Precise surgical interventions are vital to patient safety, and advanced enhancement algorithms have been developed to assist surgeons in decision-making. Despite significant progress, these algorithms are typically designed for single tasks in specific scenarios, limiting their effectiveness in complex real-world situations. To address this limitation, we propose SurgVisAgent, an end-to-end intelligent surgical vision agent built on multimodal large language models (MLLMs). SurgVisAgent dynamically identifies distortion categories and severity levels in endoscopic images, enabling it to perform a variety of enhancement tasks such as low-light enhancement, overexposure correction, motion blur elimination, and smoke removal. Specifically, to achieve superior surgical scenario understanding, we design a prior model that provides domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, through in-context few-shot learning and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, SurgVisAgent delivers customized image enhancements tailored to a wide range of distortion types and severity levels, thereby addressing the diverse requirements of surgeons. Furthermore, we construct a comprehensive benchmark simulating real-world surgical distortions, on which extensive experiments demonstrate that SurgVisAgent surpasses traditional single-task models, highlighting its potential as a unified solution for surgical assistance.

We extend the DAPO algorithm to facilitate training via independent-context multi-conversation generation. MemAgent has demonstrated superb long-context capabilities, being able to extrapolate from an 8K context trained on 32K text to a 3.5M QA task with performance loss < 5% and achieves 95%+ in 512K RULER test.

Abstract: Hurricanes cause widespread destruction, resulting in diverse damage types and severities that require timely and accurate assessment for effective disaster response. While traditional single-label classification methods fall short of capturing the complexity of post-hurricane damage, this study introduces a novel multi-label classification framework for assessing damage using aerial imagery. The proposed approach integrates a feature extraction module based on ResNet and a class-specific attention mechanism to identify multiple damage types within a single image. Using the Rescuenet dataset from Hurricane Michael, the proposed method achieves a mean average precision of 90.23%, outperforming existing baseline methods. This framework enhances post-hurricane damage assessment, enabling more targeted and efficient disaster response and contributing to future strategies for disaster mitigation and resilience. This paper has been accepted at the ASCE International Conference on Computing in Civil Engineering (i3CE 2025), and the camera-ready version will appear in the official conference proceedings.

Abstract: Video-to-Audio (V2A) Generation achieves significant progress and plays a crucial role in film and video post-production. However, current methods overlook the cinematic language, a critical component of artistic expression in filmmaking. As a result, their performance deteriorates in scenarios where Foley targets are only partially visible. To address this challenge, we propose a simple self-distillation approach to extend V2A models to cinematic language scenarios. By simulating the cinematic language variations, the student model learns to align the video features of training pairs with the same audio-visual correspondences, enabling it to effectively capture the associations between sounds and partial visual information. Our method not only achieves impressive improvements under partial visibility across all evaluation metrics, but also enhances performance on the large-scale V2A dataset, VGGSound.

Abstract: Recommendation systems have become essential in modern music streaming platforms, shaping how users discover and engage with songs. One common approach in recommendation systems is collaborative filtering, which suggests content based on the preferences of users with similar listening patterns to the target user. However, this method is less effective on media where interactions are sparse. Music is one such medium, since the average user of a music streaming service will never listen to the vast majority of tracks. Due to this sparsity, there are several challenges that have to be addressed with other methods. This review examines the current state of research in addressing these challenges, with an emphasis on the role of content filtering in mitigating biases inherent in collaborative filtering approaches. We explore various methods of song classification for content filtering, including lyrical analysis using Large Language Models (LLMs) and audio signal processing techniques. Additionally, we discuss the potential conflicts between these different analysis methods and propose avenues for resolving such discrepancies.

Abstract: Data-driven semantic communication is based on superficial statistical patterns, thereby lacking interpretability and generalization, especially for applications with the presence of unseen data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel knowledge graph-enhanced zero-shot semantic communication (KGZS-SC) network. Guided by the structured semantic information from a knowledge graph-based semantic knowledge base (KG-SKB), our scheme provides generalized semantic representations and enables reasoning for unseen cases. Specifically, the KG-SKB aligns the semantic features in a shared category semantics embedding space and enhances the generalization ability of the transmitter through aligned semantic features, thus reducing communication overhead by selectively transmitting compact visual semantics. At the receiver, zero-shot learning (ZSL) is leveraged to enable direct classification for unseen cases without the demand for retraining or additional computational overhead, thereby enhancing the adaptability and efficiency of the classification process in dynamic or resource-constrained environments. The simulation results conducted on the APY datasets show that the proposed KGZS-SC network exhibits robust generalization and significantly outperforms existing SC frameworks in classifying unseen categories across a range of SNR levels.

Abstract: Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP) has recently gained attention for its effectiveness in fine-tuning pre-trained models. Building on this, continual DAP has been explored to develop pre-trained models capable of incrementally incorporating different domain datasets. However, existing continual DAP methods face several limitations: (1) high computational cost and GPU memory usage during training; (2) sensitivity to incremental data order; and (3) providing a single, generalized model for all end tasks, which contradicts the essence of DAP. In this paper, we propose DoMIX, a novel approach that addresses these challenges by leveraging LoRA modules, a representative parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. Our approach enables efficient and parallel domain-adaptive pre-training that is robust to domain order and effectively utilizes accumulated knowledge to provide tailored pre-trained models for specific tasks. We also demonstrate that our method can be extended beyond the DAP setting to standard LLM fine-tuning scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/dohoonkim-ai/DoMIX.

Abstract: Usability evaluation is crucial in human-centered design but can be costly, requiring expert time and user compensation. In this work, we developed a method for synthetic heuristic evaluation using multimodal LLMs' ability to analyze images and provide design feedback. Comparing our synthetic evaluations to those by experienced UX practitioners across two apps, we found our evaluation identified 73% and 77% of usability issues, which exceeded the performance of 5 experienced human evaluators (57% and 63%). Compared to human evaluators, the synthetic evaluation's performance maintained consistent performance across tasks and excelled in detecting layout issues, highlighting potential attentional and perceptual strengths of synthetic evaluation. However, synthetic evaluation struggled with recognizing some UI components and design conventions, as well as identifying across screen violations. Additionally, testing synthetic evaluations over time and accounts revealed stable performance. Overall, our work highlights the performance differences between human and LLM-driven evaluations, informing the design of synthetic heuristic evaluations.

<title>Holistic Continual Learning under Concept Drift with Adaptive Memory Realignment</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02310</link>

Abstract: Traditional continual learning methods prioritize knowledge retention and focus primarily on mitigating catastrophic forgetting, implicitly assuming that the data distribution of previously learned tasks remains static. This overlooks the dynamic nature of real-world data streams, where concept drift permanently alters previously seen data and demands both stability and rapid adaptation.
  We introduce a holistic framework for continual learning under concept drift that simulates realistic scenarios by evolving task distributions. As a baseline, we consider Full Relearning (FR), in which the model is retrained from scratch on newly labeled samples from the drifted distribution. While effective, this approach incurs substantial annotation and computational overhead. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Memory Realignment (AMR), a lightweight alternative that equips rehearsal-based learners with a drift-aware adaptation mechanism. AMR selectively removes outdated samples of drifted classes from the replay buffer and repopulates it with a small number of up-to-date instances, effectively realigning memory with the new distribution. This targeted resampling matches the performance of FR while reducing the need for labeled data and computation by orders of magnitude.
  To enable reproducible evaluation, we introduce four concept-drift variants of standard vision benchmarks: Fashion-MNIST-CD, CIFAR10-CD, CIFAR100-CD, and Tiny-ImageNet-CD, where previously seen classes reappear with shifted representations. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets using several rehearsal-based baselines show that AMR consistently counters concept drift, maintaining high accuracy with minimal overhead. These results position AMR as a scalable solution that reconciles stability and plasticity in non-stationary continual learning environments.

<title>MAGIC: Mask-Guided Diffusion Inpainting with Multi-Level Perturbations and Context-Aware Alignment for Few-Shot Anomaly Generation</title>

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly generation is emerging as a practical solution for augmenting the scarce anomaly data in industrial quality control settings. An ideal generator would meet three demands at once, namely (i) keep the normal background intact, (ii) inpaint anomalous regions to tightly overlap with the corresponding anomaly masks, and (iii) generate anomalous regions in a semantically valid location, while still producing realistic, diverse appearances from only a handful of real examples. Existing diffusion-based methods usually satisfy at most two of these requirements: global anomaly generators corrupt the background, whereas mask-guided ones often falter when the mask is imprecise or misplaced. We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting with multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all three issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting backbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the synthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background corruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can cause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian prompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that broadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual appearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local texture variations. Additionally, the context-aware mask alignment module forms semantic correspondences and relocates masks so that every anomaly remains plausibly contained within the host object, eliminating out-of-boundary artifacts. Under a consistent identical evaluation protocol on the MVTec-AD dataset, MAGIC outperforms previous state-of-the-arts in downstream anomaly tasks.

Abstract: Rice leaf diseases significantly reduce productivity and cause economic losses, highlighting the need for early detection to enable effective management and improve yields. This study proposes Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based image-processing techniques for timely classification and recognition of rice diseases. Despite the prevailing approach of directly inputting images of rice leaves into ANNs, there is a noticeable absence of thorough comparative analysis between the Feature Analysis Detection Model (FADM) and Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM), specifically when it comes to evaluating the effectiveness of Feature Extraction Algorithms (FEAs). Hence, this research presents initial experiments on the Feature Analysis Detection Model, utilizing various image Feature Extraction Algorithms, Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms (DRAs), Feature Selection Algorithms (FSAs), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The experiments are carried out on datasets encompassing bacterial leaf blight, brown spot, leaf blast, leaf scald, Sheath blight rot, and healthy leaf, utilizing 10-fold Cross-Validation method. A Direct Image-Centric Detection Model is established without the utilization of any FEA, and the evaluation of classification performance relies on different metrics. Ultimately, an exhaustive contrast is performed between the achievements of the Feature Analysis Detection Model and Direct Image-Centric Detection Model in classifying rice leaf diseases. The results reveal that the highest performance is attained using the Feature Analysis Detection Model. The adoption of the proposed Feature Analysis Detection Model for detecting rice leaf diseases holds excellent potential for improving crop health, minimizing yield losses, and enhancing overall productivity and sustainability of rice farming.

Abstract: This paper leverages the recently introduced concept of algorithm footprints to investigate the interplay between algorithm configurations and problem characteristics. Performance footprints are calculated for six modular variants of the CMA-ES algorithm (modCMA), evaluated on 24 benchmark problems from the BBOB suite, across two-dimensional settings: 5-dimensional and 30-dimensional. These footprints provide insights into why different configurations of the same algorithm exhibit varying performance and identify the problem features influencing these outcomes. Our analysis uncovers shared behavioral patterns across configurations due to common interactions with problem properties, as well as distinct behaviors on the same problem driven by differing problem features. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of algorithm footprints in enhancing interpretability and guiding configuration choices.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of numerical metaheuristic optimization algorithms is critical for advancing their development and application. Traditional visualization techniques, such as convergence plots, trajectory mapping, and fitness landscape analysis, often fall short in illustrating the structural dynamics of the search process, especially in high-dimensional or complex solution spaces. To address this, we propose a novel representation and visualization methodology that clusters solution candidates explored by the algorithm and tracks the evolution of cluster memberships across iterations, offering a dynamic and interpretable view of the search process. Additionally, we introduce two metrics - algorithm stability and algorithm similarity- to quantify the consistency of search trajectories across runs of an individual algorithm and the similarity between different algorithms, respectively. We apply this methodology to a set of ten numerical metaheuristic algorithms, revealing insights into their stability and comparative behaviors, thereby providing a deeper understanding of their search dynamics.

Abstract: This study proposes DeltaSHAP, a novel explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) algorithm specifically designed for online patient monitoring systems. In clinical environments, discovering the causes driving patient risk evolution is critical for timely intervention, yet existing XAI methods fail to address the unique requirements of clinical time series explanation tasks. To this end, DeltaSHAP addresses three key clinical needs: explaining the changes in the consecutive predictions rather than isolated prediction scores, providing both magnitude and direction of feature attributions, and delivering these insights in real time. By adapting Shapley values to temporal settings, our approach accurately captures feature coalition effects. It further attributes prediction changes using only the actually observed feature combinations, making it efficient and practical for time-sensitive clinical applications. We also introduce new evaluation metrics to evaluate the faithfulness of the attributions for online time series, and demonstrate through experiments on online patient monitoring tasks that DeltaSHAP outperforms state-of-the-art XAI methods in both explanation quality as 62% and computational efficiency as 33% time reduction on the MIMIC-III decompensation benchmark. We release our code at https://github.com/AITRICS/DeltaSHAP.

Abstract: Antibody engineering is essential for developing therapeutics and advancing biomedical research. Traditional discovery methods often rely on time-consuming and resource-intensive experimental screening. To enhance and streamline this process, we introduce a production-grade, high-throughput platform built on HelixFold3, HelixDesign-Antibody, which utilizes the high-accuracy structure prediction model, HelixFold3. The platform facilitates the large-scale generation of antibody candidate sequences and evaluates their interaction with antigens. Integrated high-performance computing (HPC) support enables high-throughput screening, addressing challenges such as fragmented toolchains and high computational demands. Validation on multiple antigens showcases the platform's ability to generate diverse and high-quality antibodies, confirming a scaling law where exploring larger sequence spaces increases the likelihood of identifying optimal binders. This platform provides a seamless, accessible solution for large-scale antibody design and is available via the antibody design page of PaddleHelix platform.

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms (ICA) commonly occur in specific segments of the Circle of Willis (CoW), primarily, onto thirteen major arterial bifurcations. An accurate detection of these critical landmarks is necessary for a prompt and efficient diagnosis. We introduce a fully automated landmark detection approach for CoW bifurcations using a two-step neural networks process. Initially, an object detection network identifies regions of interest (ROIs) proximal to the landmark locations. Subsequently, a modified U-Net with deep supervision is exploited to accurately locate the bifurcations. This two-step method reduces various problems, such as the missed detections caused by two landmarks being close to each other and having similar visual characteristics, especially when processing the complete MRA Time-of-Flight (TOF). Additionally, it accounts for the anatomical variability of the CoW, which affects the number of detectable landmarks per scan. We assessed the effectiveness of our approach using two cerebral MRA datasets: our In-House dataset which had varying numbers of landmarks, and a public dataset with standardized landmark configuration. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the highest level of performance on a bifurcation detection task.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) optimizes a policy using only a fixed dataset, making it a practical approach in scenarios where interaction with the environment is costly. Due to this limitation, generalization ability is key to improving the performance of offline RL algorithms, as demonstrated by recent successes of offline RL with diffusion models. However, it remains questionable whether such diffusion models are necessary for highly performing offline RL algorithms, given their significant computational requirements during inference. In this paper, we propose Penalized Action Noise Injection (PANI), a method that simply enhances offline learning by utilizing noise-injected actions to cover the entire action space, while penalizing according to the amount of noise injected. This approach is inspired by how diffusion models have worked in offline RL algorithms. We provide a theoretical foundation for this method, showing that offline RL algorithms with such noise-injected actions solve a modified Markov Decision Process (MDP), which we call the noisy action MDP. PANI is compatible with a wide range of existing off-policy and offline RL algorithms, and despite its simplicity, it demonstrates significant performance improvements across various benchmarks.

Abstract: The vanilla autoregressive image generation model generates visual tokens in a step-by-step fashion, which limits the ability to capture holistic relationships among token sequences. Moreover, most visual tokenizers map local image patches into latent tokens, leading to limited global information. To address this, we introduce \textit{Hita}, a novel image tokenizer for autoregressive (AR) image generation. It introduces a holistic-to-local tokenization scheme with learnable holistic queries and local patch tokens. Besides, Hita incorporates two key strategies for improved alignment with the AR generation process: 1) it arranges a sequential structure with holistic tokens at the beginning followed by patch-level tokens while using causal attention to maintain awareness of previous tokens; and 2) before feeding the de-quantized tokens into the decoder, Hita adopts a lightweight fusion module to control information flow to prioritize holistic tokens. Extensive experiments show that Hita accelerates the training speed of AR generators and outperforms those trained with vanilla tokenizers, achieving \textbf{2.59 FID} and \textbf{281.9 IS} on the ImageNet benchmark. A detailed analysis of the holistic representation highlights its ability to capture global image properties such as textures, materials, and shapes. Additionally, Hita also demonstrates effectiveness in zero-shot style transfer and image in-painting.

Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a distributed AI software deployment mechanism for cross-silo collaboration without accessing participants' data. However, existing VFL work lacks a mechanism to audit the execution correctness of the inference software of the data party. To address this problem, we design a Vertical Federated Inference Auditing (VeFIA) framework. VeFIA helps the task party to audit whether the data party's inference software is executed as expected during large-scale inference without leaking the data privacy of the data party or introducing additional latency to the inference system. The core of VeFIA is that the task party can use the inference results from a framework with Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) and the coordinator to validate the correctness of the data party's computation results. VeFIA guarantees that, as long as the abnormal inference exceeds 5.4%, the task party can detect execution anomalies in the inference software with a probability of 99.99%, without incurring any additional online inference latency. VeFIA's random sampling validation achieves 100% positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and true positive rate in detecting abnormal inference. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to discuss the correctness of inference software execution in VFL.

Abstract: Log analysis is a relevant research field in cybersecurity as they can provide a source of information for the detection of threats to networks and systems. This paper presents a pipeline to use fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) for anomaly detection and mitigation recommendation using IoT security logs. Utilizing classical machine learning classifiers as a baseline, three open-source LLMs are compared for binary and multiclass anomaly detection, with three strategies: zero-shot, few-shot prompting and fine-tuning using an IoT dataset. LLMs give better results on multi-class attack classification than the corresponding baseline models. By mapping detected threats to MITRE CAPEC, defining a set of IoT-specific mitigation actions, and fine-tuning the models with those actions, the models are able to provide a combined detection and recommendation guidance.

Abstract: We introduce a deepfake video detection approach that exploits pixel-wise temporal inconsistencies, which traditional spatial frequency-based detectors often overlook. Traditional detectors represent temporal information merely by stacking spatial frequency spectra across frames, resulting in the failure to detect temporal artifacts in the pixel plane. Our approach performs a 1D Fourier transform on the time axis for each pixel, extracting features highly sensitive to temporal inconsistencies, especially in areas prone to unnatural movements. To precisely locate regions containing the temporal artifacts, we introduce an attention proposal module trained in an end-to-end manner. Additionally, our joint transformer module effectively integrates pixel-wise temporal frequency features with spatio-temporal context features, expanding the range of detectable forgery artifacts. Our framework represents a significant advancement in deepfake video detection, providing robust performance across diverse and challenging detection scenarios.

Abstract: Wildlife re-identification aims to match individuals of the same species across different observations. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models rely on class labels to train supervised models for individual classification. This dependence on annotated data has driven the curation of numerous large-scale wildlife datasets. This study investigates self-supervised learning Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for wildlife re-identification. We automatically extract two distinct views of an individual using temporal image pairs from camera trap data without supervision. The image pairs train a self-supervised model from a potentially endless stream of video data. We evaluate the learnt representations against supervised features on open-world scenarios and transfer learning in various wildlife downstream tasks. The analysis of the experimental results shows that self-supervised models are more robust even with limited data. Moreover, self-supervised features outperform supervision across all downstream tasks. The code is available here https://github.com/pxpana/SSLWildlife.

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) combines the privacy-preserving capabilities of federated learning (FL) with the strong graph modeling capability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Current research addresses subgraph-FL only from the structural perspective, neglecting the propagation of graph signals on spatial and spectral domains of the structure. From a spatial perspective, subgraph-FL introduces edge disconnections between clients, leading to disruptions in label signals and a degradation in the class knowledge of the global GNN. From a spectral perspective, spectral heterogeneity causes inconsistencies in signal frequencies across subgraphs, which makes local GNNs overfit the local signal propagation schemes. As a result, spectral client drifts occur, undermining global generalizability. To tackle the challenges, we propose a global knowledge repository to mitigate label signal disruption and a frequency alignment to address spectral client drifts. The combination of spatial and spectral strategies forms our framework S2FGL. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of S2FGL. The code is available at https://github.com/Wonder7racer/S2FGL.git.

Abstract: Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) in large enterprises can generate hundreds of thousands of alerts per hour, overwhelming security analysts with logs that demand deep, rapidly evolving domain expertise. Conventional machine-learning detectors trim the alert volume but still yield high false-positive rates, while standard single-pass Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines often retrieve irrelevant context and fail to justify their predictions. To overcome these shortcomings, we present CyberRAG, a modular, agent-based RAG framework that delivers real-time classification, explanation, and structured reporting for cyber-attacks. A central LLM agent orchestrates (i) a pool of fine-tuned specialized classifiers, each tailored to a distinct attack family; (ii) tool adapters for enrichment and alerting; and (iii) an iterative retrieval-and-reason loop that continuously queries a domain-specific knowledge base until the evidence is both relevant and self-consistent. Unlike traditional RAG systems, CyberRAG embraces an agentic design that enables dynamic control flow and adaptive reasoning. This agent-centric architecture refines its threat labels and natural-language justifications autonomously, reducing false positives and enhancing interpretability. The framework is fully extensible: new attack types can be supported by simply adding a classifier without retraining the core agent. CyberRAG has been evaluated achieving over 94% accuracy per class and pushing final classification accuracy to 94.92% through semantic orchestration. Generated explanations score up to 0.94 in BERTScore and 4.9/5 in GPT-4-based expert evaluation. These results show that agentic, specialist-oriented RAG can pair high detection accuracy with trustworthy, SOC-ready prose, offering a practical and scalable path toward semi-autonomous cyber-defence workflows.

Abstract: Advances in material functionalities drive innovations across various fields, where metamaterials-defined by structure rather than composition-are leading the way. Despite the rise of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven design strategies, their impact is limited by task-specific retraining, poor out-of-distribution(OOD) generalization, and the need for separate models for forward and inverse design. To address these limitations, we introduce the Metamaterial Foundation Model (MetaFO), a Bayesian transformer-based foundation model inspired by large language models. MetaFO learns the underlying mechanics of metamaterials, enabling probabilistic, zero-shot predictions across diverse, unseen combinations of material properties and structural responses. It also excels in nonlinear inverse design, even under OOD conditions. By treating metamaterials as an operator that maps material properties to structural responses, MetaFO uncovers intricate structure-property relationships and significantly expands the design space. This scalable and generalizable framework marks a paradigm shift in AI-driven metamaterial discovery, paving the way for next-generation innovations.

Abstract: Robots usually slow down for canning to detect objects while moving. Additionally, the robot's camera is configured with a low framerate to track the velocity of the detection algorithms. This would be constrained while executing tasks and exploring, making robots increase the task execution time. AMD has developed the Vitis-AI framework to deploy detection algorithms into FPGAs. However, this tool does not fully use the FPGAs' PL. In this work, we use the FINN architecture to deploy three ANNs, MobileNet v1 with 4-bit quantisation, CNV with 2-bit quantisation, and CNV with 1-bit quantisation (BNN), inside an FPGA's PL. The models were trained on the RG2C dataset. This is a self-acquired dataset released in open access. MobileNet v1 performed better, reaching a success rate of 98 % and an inference speed of 6611 FPS. In this work, we proved that we can use FPGAs to speed up ANNs and make them suitable for attention mechanisms.

<title>CrowdTrack: A Benchmark for Difficult Multiple Pedestrian Tracking in Real Scenarios</title>

Abstract: Multi-object tracking is a classic field in computer vision. Among them, pedestrian tracking has extremely high application value and has become the most popular research category. Existing methods mainly use motion or appearance information for tracking, which is often difficult in complex scenarios. For the motion information, mutual occlusions between objects often prevent updating of the motion state; for the appearance information, non-robust results are often obtained due to reasons such as only partial visibility of the object or blurred images. Although learning how to perform tracking in these situations from the annotated data is the simplest solution, the existing MOT dataset fails to satisfy this solution. Existing methods mainly have two drawbacks: relatively simple scene composition and non-realistic scenarios. Although some of the video sequences in existing dataset do not have the above-mentioned drawbacks, the number is far from adequate for research purposes. To this end, we propose a difficult large-scale dataset for multi-pedestrian tracking, shot mainly from the first-person view and all from real-life complex scenarios. We name it ``CrowdTrack'' because there are numerous objects in most of the sequences. Our dataset consists of 33 videos, containing a total of 5,185 trajectories. Each object is annotated with a complete bounding box and a unique object ID. The dataset will provide a platform to facilitate the development of algorithms that remain effective in complex situations. We analyzed the dataset comprehensively and tested multiple SOTA models on our dataset. Besides, we analyzed the performance of the foundation models on our dataset. The dataset and project code is released at: https://github.com/loseevaya/CrowdTrack .

Abstract: Automated polyp counting in colonoscopy is a crucial step toward automated procedure reporting and quality control, aiming to enhance the cost-effectiveness of colonoscopy screening. Counting polyps in a procedure involves detecting and tracking polyps, and then clustering tracklets that belong to the same polyp entity. Existing methods for polyp counting rely on self-supervised learning and primarily leverage visual appearance, neglecting temporal relationships in both tracklet feature learning and clustering stages. In this work, we introduce a paradigm shift by proposing a supervised contrastive loss that incorporates temporally-aware soft targets. Our approach captures intra-polyp variability while preserving inter-polyp discriminability, leading to more robust clustering. Additionally, we improve tracklet clustering by integrating a temporal adjacency constraint, reducing false positive re-associations between visually similar but temporally distant tracklets. We train and validate our method on publicly available datasets and evaluate its performance with a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. Results demonstrate a 2.2x reduction in fragmentation rate compared to prior approaches. Our results highlight the importance of temporal awareness in polyp counting, establishing a new state-of-the-art. Code is available at https://github.com/lparolari/temporally-aware-polyp-counting.

Abstract: Continual fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is hampered by the trade-off between efficiency and expressiveness. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offers efficiency but constrains the model's ability to learn new tasks and transfer knowledge due to its low-rank nature and reliance on explicit parameter constraints. We propose GORP (Gradient LOw Rank Projection) for Continual Learning, a novel training strategy that overcomes these limitations by synergistically combining full and low-rank parameters and jointly updating within a unified low-rank gradient subspace. GORP expands the optimization space while preserving efficiency and mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments on continual learning benchmarks demonstrate GORP's superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/Wcxwcxw/GORP.

Abstract: India, as a predominantly agrarian economy, faces significant challenges in agriculture, including substantial crop losses caused by diseases, pests, and environmental stress. Early detection and accurate identification of diseases across different crops are critical for improving yield and ensuring food security. This paper proposes a deep learning based solution for detecting multiple diseases in multiple crops, aimed to cover India's diverse agricultural landscape. We first create a unified dataset encompassing images of 17 different crops and 34 different diseases from various available repositories. Proposed deep learning model is trained on this dataset and outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and the number of crops, diseases covered. We achieve a significant detection accuracy, i.e., 99 percent for our unified dataset which is 7 percent more when compared to state-of-the-art handling 14 crops and 26 different diseases only. By improving the number of crops and types of diseases that can be detected, proposed solution aims to provide a better product for Indian farmers.

Abstract: Conversational agents have made significant progress since ELIZA, expanding their role across various domains, including healthcare, education, and customer service. As these agents become increasingly integrated into daily human interactions, the need for emotional intelligence, particularly empathetic listening, becomes increasingly essential. In this study, we explore how Large Language Models (LLMs) respond when tasked with generating emotionally rich interactions. Starting from a small dataset manually crafted by an expert to reflect empathic behavior, we extended the conversations using two LLMs: ChatGPT and Gemini. We analyzed the emotional progression of the dialogues using both sentiment analysis (via VADER) and expert assessments. While the generated conversations often mirrored the intended emotional structure, human evaluation revealed important differences in the perceived empathy and coherence of the responses. These findings suggest that emotion modeling in dialogues requires not only structural alignment in the expressed emotions but also qualitative depth, highlighting the importance of combining automated and humancentered methods in the development of emotionally competent agents.

Abstract: Overparametrized Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in a wide variety of domains too high-dimensional for classical shallow networks subject to the curse of dimensionality. However, open questions about fundamental principles, that govern the learning dynamics of DNNs, remain. In this position paper we argue that it is the ability of DNNs to exploit the compositionally sparse structure of the target function driving their success. As such, DNNs can leverage the property that most practically relevant functions can be composed from a small set of constituent functions, each of which relies only on a low-dimensional subset of all inputs. We show that this property is shared by all efficiently Turing-computable functions and is therefore highly likely present in all current learning problems. While some promising theoretical insights on questions concerned with approximation and generalization exist in the setting of compositionally sparse functions, several important questions on the learnability and optimization of DNNs remain. Completing the picture of the role of compositional sparsity in deep learning is essential to a comprehensive theory of artificial, and even general, intelligence.

Abstract: Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability. Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly outperforms all opensource agents in complex information-seeking tasks, matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.

Abstract: Multiperspective Fusion (MPF) is a novel posttraining alignment framework for large language models (LLMs) developed in response to the growing need for easy bias mitigation. Built on top of the SAGED pipeline, an automated system for constructing bias benchmarks and extracting interpretable baseline distributions, MPF leverages multiperspective generations to expose and align biases in LLM outputs with nuanced, humanlike baselines. By decomposing baseline, such as sentiment distributions from HR professionals, into interpretable perspective components, MPF guides generation through sampling and balancing of responses, weighted by the probabilities obtained in the decomposition. Empirically, we demonstrate its ability to align LLM sentiment distributions with both counterfactual baselines (absolute equality) and the HR baseline (biased for Top Univeristy), resulting in small KL divergence, reduction of calibration error and generalization to unseen questions. This shows that MPF offers a scalable and interpretable method for alignment and bias mitigation, compatible with deployed LLMs and requiring no extensive prompt engineering or finetuning.

Abstract: Arithmetic circuits, such as adders and multipliers, are fundamental components of digital systems, directly impacting the performance, power efficiency, and area footprint. However, optimizing these circuits remains challenging due to the vast design space and complex physical constraints. While recent deep learning-based approaches have shown promise, they struggle to consistently explore high-potential design variants, limiting their optimization efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose AC-Refiner, a novel arithmetic circuit optimization framework leveraging conditional diffusion models. Our key insight is to reframe arithmetic circuit synthesis as a conditional image generation task. By carefully conditioning the denoising diffusion process on target quality-of-results (QoRs), AC-Refiner consistently produces high-quality circuit designs. Furthermore, the explored designs are used to fine-tune the diffusion model, which focuses the exploration near the Pareto frontier. Experimental results demonstrate that AC-Refiner generates designs with superior Pareto optimality, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. The performance gain is further validated by integrating AC-Refiner into practical applications.

Abstract: The increasing importance of Vision-Based Navigation (VBN) algorithms in space missions raises numerous challenges in ensuring their reliability and operational robustness. Sensor faults can lead to inaccurate outputs from navigation algorithms or even complete data processing faults, potentially compromising mission objectives. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a powerful solution for detecting such faults, overcoming many of the limitations associated with traditional fault detection methods. However, the primary obstacle to the adoption of AI in this context is the lack of sufficient and representative datasets containing faulty image data.
  This study addresses these challenges by focusing on an interplanetary exploration mission scenario. A comprehensive analysis of potential fault cases in camera sensors used within the VBN pipeline is presented. The causes and effects of these faults are systematically characterized, including their impact on image quality and navigation algorithm performance, as well as commonly employed mitigation strategies. To support this analysis, a simulation framework is introduced to recreate faulty conditions in synthetically generated images, enabling a systematic and controlled reproduction of faulty data. The resulting dataset of fault-injected images provides a valuable tool for training and testing AI-based fault detection algorithms. The final link to the dataset will be added after an embargo period. For peer-reviewers, this private link is available.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech generation models has heightened privacy and security concerns related to voice cloning (VC). Recent studies have investigated disrupting unauthorized voice cloning by introducing adversarial perturbations. However, determined attackers can mitigate these protective perturbations and successfully execute VC. In this study, we conduct the first systematic evaluation of these protective perturbations against VC under realistic threat models that include perturbation purification. Our findings reveal that while existing purification methods can neutralize a considerable portion of the protective perturbations, they still lead to distortions in the feature space of VC models, which degrades the performance of VC. From this perspective, we propose a novel two-stage purification method: (1) Purify the perturbed speech; (2) Refine it using phoneme guidance to align it with the clean speech distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art purification methods in disrupting VC defenses. Our study reveals the limitations of adversarial perturbation-based VC defenses and underscores the urgent need for more robust solutions to mitigate the security and privacy risks posed by VC. The code and audio samples are available at https://de-antifake.github.io.

Abstract: Distributed inference serves as a promising approach to enabling the inference of large language models (LLMs) at the network edge. It distributes the inference process to multiple devices to ensure that the LLMs can fit into the device memory. Recent pipeline-based approaches have the potential to parallelize communication and computation, which helps reduce inference latency. However, the benefit diminishes when the inference request at the network edge is sparse, where pipeline is typically at low utilization. To enable efficient distributed LLM inference at the edge, we propose \textbf{FlowSpec}, a pipeline-parallel tree-based speculative decoding framework. FlowSpec incorporates three key mechanisms to improve decoding efficiency: 1) score-based step-wise verification prioritizes more important draft tokens to bring earlier accpeted tokens; 2) efficient draft management to prune invalid tokens while maintaining correct causal relationship during verification; 3) dynamic draft expansion strategies to supply high-quality speculative inputs. These techniques work in concert to enhance both pipeline utilization and speculative efficiency. We evaluate FlowSpec on a real-world testbed with other baselines. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly improves inference speed across diverse models and configurations, achieving speedup ratios 1.36$\times$-1.77$\times$ compared to baselines.

Abstract: The rapid development of neural quantum states (NQS) has established it as a promising framework for studying quantum many-body systems. In this work, by leveraging the cutting-edge transformer-based architectures and developing highly efficient optimization algorithms, we achieve the state-of-the-art results for the doped two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model, arguably the minimum model for high-Tc superconductivity. Interestingly, we find different attention heads in the NQS ansatz can directly encode correlations at different scales, making it capable of capturing long-range correlations and entanglements in strongly correlated systems. With these advances, we establish the half-filled stripe in the ground state of 2D Hubbard model with the next nearest neighboring hoppings, consistent with experimental observations in cuprates. Our work establishes NQS as a powerful tool for solving challenging many-fermions systems.

Abstract: In recent advancements in audio self-supervised representation learning, the standard Transformer architecture has emerged as the predominant approach, yet its attention mechanism often allocates a portion of attention weights to irrelevant information, potentially impairing the model's discriminative ability. To address this, we introduce a differential attention mechanism, which effectively mitigates ineffective attention allocation through the integration of dual-softmax operations and appropriately tuned differential coefficients. Experimental results demonstrate that our ASDA model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple benchmarks, including audio classification (49.0% mAP on AS-2M, 41.5% mAP on AS20K), keyword spotting (98.3% accuracy on SPC-2), and environmental sound classification (96.1% accuracy on ESC-50). These results highlight ASDA's effectiveness in audio tasks, paving the way for broader applications.

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models using limited data presents significant challenges, including overfitting, loss of prior knowledge, and degradation of text alignment. Overfitting leads to shifts in the noise prediction distribution, disrupting the denoising trajectory and causing the model to lose semantic coherence. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Personalized Training (APT), a novel framework that mitigates overfitting by employing adaptive training strategies and regularizing the model's internal representations during fine-tuning. APT consists of three key components: (1) Adaptive Training Adjustment, which introduces an overfitting indicator to detect the degree of overfitting at each time step bin and applies adaptive data augmentation and adaptive loss weighting based on this indicator; (2)Representation Stabilization, which regularizes the mean and variance of intermediate feature maps to prevent excessive shifts in noise prediction; and (3) Attention Alignment for Prior Knowledge Preservation, which aligns the cross-attention maps of the fine-tuned model with those of the pretrained model to maintain prior knowledge and semantic coherence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that APT effectively mitigates overfitting, preserves prior knowledge, and outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, diverse images with limited reference data.

Abstract: Image generation has achieved remarkable progress with the development of large-scale text-to-image models, especially diffusion-based models. However, generating human images with plausible details, such as faces or hands, remains challenging due to insufficient supervision of local regions during training. To address this issue, we propose FairHuman, a multi-objective fine-tuning approach designed to enhance both global and local generation quality fairly. Specifically, we first construct three learning objectives: a global objective derived from the default diffusion objective function and two local objectives for hands and faces based on pre-annotated positional priors. Subsequently, we derive the optimal parameter updating strategy under the guidance of the Minimum Potential Delay (MPD) criterion, thereby attaining fairness-ware optimization for this multi-objective problem. Based on this, our proposed method can achieve significant improvements in generating challenging local details while maintaining overall quality. Extensive experiments showcase the effectiveness of our method in improving the performance of human image generation under different scenarios.

Abstract: Prompt injection attacks pose a significant security threat to LLM-integrated applications. Model-level defenses have shown strong effectiveness, but are currently deployed into commercial-grade models in a closed-source manner. We believe open-source models are needed by the AI security community, where co-development of attacks and defenses through open research drives scientific progress in mitigation against prompt injection attacks. To this end, we develop Meta SecAlign, the first open-source and open-weight LLM with built-in model-level defense that achieves commercial-grade model performance. We provide complete details of our training recipe, which utilizes an improved version of the SOTA SecAlign defense. Evaluations on 9 utility benchmarks and 7 security benchmarks show that Meta SecAlign, despite being trained on a generic instruction-tuning dataset, confers security in unseen downstream tasks, including tool-calling and agentic web navigation, in addition general instruction-following. Our best model -- Meta-SecAlign-70B -- achieves state-of-the-art robustness against prompt injection attacks and comparable utility to closed-source commercial LLM with model-level defense.

Abstract: Monitoring Large Language Model (LLM) outputs is crucial for mitigating risks from misuse and misalignment. However, LLMs could evade monitoring through steganography: Encoding hidden information within seemingly benign generations. In this paper, we evaluate the steganography capabilities in frontier LLMs to better understand the risk they pose. We focus on two types of steganography: passing encoded messages and performing encoded reasoning. We find that current models are unable to encode short messages in their outputs without a monitor noticing under standard affordances. They can succeed, however, if given additional affordances such as using an unmonitored scratchpad and coordinating on what encoding scheme to use. We additionally find early signs that models can perform basic encoded reasoning in a simple state-tracking problem. This includes some ability to reason with their own and pre-defined schemes, including encoding schemes such as Hexadecimal. Despite this, they can rarely hide reasoning subtly within a cover task to fool a monitor. Overall, our results indicate that current LLMs exhibit nascent steganographic capabilities. While these capabilities are likely insufficient to bypass well-designed monitors at present, this could change in the future.

Abstract: Transformers have become the de facto standard for a wide range of tasks, from image classification to physics simulations. Despite their impressive performance, the quadratic complexity of standard Transformers in both memory and time with respect to the input length makes them impractical for processing high-resolution inputs. Therefore, several variants have been proposed, the most successful relying on patchification, downsampling, or coarsening techniques, often at the cost of losing the finest-scale details. In this work, we take a different approach. Inspired by state-of-the-art techniques in $n$-body numerical simulations, we cast attention as an interaction problem between grid points. We introduce the Multipole Attention Neural Operator (MANO), which computes attention in a distance-based multiscale fashion. MANO maintains, in each attention head, a global receptive field and achieves linear time and memory complexity with respect to the number of grid points. Empirical results on image classification and Darcy flows demonstrate that MANO rivals state-of-the-art models such as ViT and Swin Transformer, while reducing runtime and peak memory usage by orders of magnitude. We open source our code for reproducibility at https://github.com/AlexColagrande/MANO.

Abstract: The disconnect between AI-generated molecules with desirable properties and their synthetic feasibility remains a critical bottleneck in computational drug and material discovery. While generative AI has accelerated the proposal of candidate molecules, many of these structures prove challenging or impossible to synthesize using established chemical reactions. Here, we introduce SynTwins, a novel retrosynthesis-guided molecular analog design framework that designs synthetically accessible molecular analogs by emulating expert chemist strategies through a three-step process: retrosynthesis, similar building block searching, and virtual synthesis. In comparative evaluations, SynTwins demonstrates superior performance in generating synthetically accessible analogs compared to state-of-the-art machine learning models while maintaining high structural similarity to original target molecules. Furthermore, when integrated with existing molecule optimization frameworks, our hybrid approach produces synthetically feasible molecules with property profiles comparable to unconstrained molecule generators, yet its synthesizability ensured. Our comprehensive benchmarking across diverse molecular datasets demonstrates that SynTwins effectively bridges the gap between computational design and experimental synthesis, providing a practical solution for accelerating the discovery of synthesizable molecules with desired properties for a wide range of applications.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that training loss scales as a power law with both model size and the number of tokens, and that achieving compute-optimal models requires scaling model size and token count together. However, these scaling laws assume an infinite supply of data and apply primarily in compute-bound settings. As modern large language models increasingly rely on massive internet-scale datasets, the assumption that they are compute-bound is becoming less valid. This shift highlights the need for architectures that prioritize token efficiency.
  In this work, we investigate the use of the 2-simplicial Transformer, an architecture that generalizes standard dot-product attention to trilinear functions through an efficient Triton kernel implementation. We demonstrate that the 2-simplicial Transformer achieves better token efficiency than standard Transformers: for a fixed token budget, similarly sized models outperform their dot-product counterparts on tasks involving mathematics, coding, reasoning, and logic. We quantify these gains by demonstrating that $2$-simplicial attention changes the exponent in the scaling laws for knowledge and reasoning tasks compared to dot product attention.

<title>Multi-agent Auditory Scene Analysis</title>

Abstract: Auditory scene analysis (ASA) aims to retrieve information from the acoustic environment, by carrying out three main tasks: sound source location, separation, and classification. These tasks are traditionally executed with a linear data flow, where the sound sources are first located; then, using their location, each source is separated into its own audio stream; from each of which, information is extracted that is relevant to the application scenario (audio event detection, speaker identification, emotion classification, etc.). However, running these tasks linearly increases the overall response time, while making the last tasks (separation and classification) highly sensitive to errors of the first task (location). A considerable amount of effort and computational complexity has been employed in the state-of-the-art to develop techniques that are the least error-prone possible. However, doing so gives rise to an ASA system that is non-viable in many applications that require a small computational footprint and a low response time, such as bioacoustics, hearing-aid design, search and rescue, human-robot interaction, etc. To this effect, in this work, a multi-agent approach is proposed to carry out ASA where the tasks are run in parallel, with feedback loops between them to compensate for local errors, such as: using the quality of the separation output to correct the location error; and using the classification result to reduce the localization's sensitivity towards interferences. The result is a multi-agent auditory scene analysis (MASA) system that is robust against local errors, without a considerable increase in complexity, and with a low response time. The complete proposed MASA system is provided as a framework that uses open-source tools for sound acquisition and reproduction (JACK) and inter-agent communication (ROS2), allowing users to add their own agents.

<title>Self-Correction Bench: Revealing and Addressing the Self-Correction Blind Spot in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have become transformative, they still make mistakes and can explore unproductive reasoning paths. Self-correction is an important capability for a trustworthy LLM, particularly an autoregressive LLM. While LLMs can identify error in user input, they exhibit a systematic 'Self-Correction Blind Spot' - failing to correct identical error in their own outputs. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce Self-Correction Bench, a systematic framework to measure this phenomenon through controlled error injection at three complexity levels. Testing 14 models, we find an average 64.5% blind spot rate. We find multiple evidences that this limitation relates to training data composition: human training demonstrations predominantly show error-free responses rather than error-correction sequences, unlike RL-trained models that learn error correction through outcome feedback. Remarkably, simply appending "Wait" reduces blind spots by 89.3%, suggesting that the capability exists but requires activation. Our work highlights a critical limitation in current LLMs and offers potential avenues for improving their reliability and trustworthiness.

<title>SynapseRoute: An Auto-Route Switching Framework on Dual-State Large Language Model</title>

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in practical applications, selecting an appropriate model requires balancing not only performance but also operational cost. The emergence of reasoning-capable models has further widened the cost gap between "thinking" (high reasoning) and "non-thinking" (fast, low-cost) modes. In this work, we reveal that approximately 58% of medical questions can be accurately answered by the non-thinking mode alone, without requiring the high-cost reasoning process. This highlights a clear dichotomy in problem complexity and suggests that dynamically routing queries to the appropriate mode based on complexity could optimize accuracy, cost-efficiency, and overall user experience. Based on this, we further propose SynapseRoute, a machine learning-based dynamic routing framework that intelligently assigns input queries to either thinking or non-thinking modes. Experimental results on several medical datasets demonstrate that SynapseRoute not only improves overall accuracy (0.8390 vs. 0.8272) compared to the thinking mode alone but also reduces inference time by 36.8% and token consumption by 39.66%. Importantly, qualitative analysis indicates that over-reasoning on simpler queries can lead to unnecessary delays and even decreased accuracy, a pitfall avoided by our adaptive routing. Finally, this work further introduces the Accuracy-Inference-Token (AIT) index to comprehensively evaluate the trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and token cost.

<title>DNN-Based Precoding in RIS-Aided mmWave MIMO Systems With Practical Phase Shift</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.02824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the precoding design is investigated for maximizing the throughput of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with obstructed direct communication paths. In particular, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is employed to enhance MIMO transmissions, considering mmWave characteristics related to line-of-sight (LoS) and multipath effects. The traditional exhaustive search (ES) for optimal codewords in the continuous phase shift is computationally intensive and time-consuming. To reduce computational complexity, permuted discrete Fourier transform (DFT) vectors are used for finding codebook design, incorporating amplitude responses for practical or ideal RIS systems. However, even if the discrete phase shift is adopted in the ES, it results in significant computation and is time-consuming. Instead, the trained deep neural network (DNN) is developed to facilitate faster codeword selection. Simulation results show that the DNN maintains sub-optimal spectral efficiency even as the distance between the end-user and the RIS has variations in the testing phase. These results highlight the potential of DNN in advancing RIS-aided systems.

<title>USAD: An Unsupervised Data Augmentation Spatio-Temporal Attention Diffusion Network</title>

Abstract: The primary objective of human activity recognition (HAR) is to infer ongoing human actions from sensor data, a task that finds broad applications in health monitoring, safety protection, and sports analysis. Despite proliferating research, HAR still faces key challenges, including the scarcity of labeled samples for rare activities, insufficient extraction of high-level features, and suboptimal model performance on lightweight devices. To address these issues, this paper proposes a comprehensive optimization approach centered on multi-attention interaction mechanisms. First, an unsupervised, statistics-guided diffusion model is employed to perform data augmentation, thereby alleviating the problems of labeled data scarcity and severe class imbalance. Second, a multi-branch spatio-temporal interaction network is designed, which captures multi-scale features of sequential data through parallel residual branches with 3*3, 5*5, and 7*7 convolutional kernels. Simultaneously, temporal attention mechanisms are incorporated to identify critical time points, while spatial attention enhances inter-sensor interactions. A cross-branch feature fusion unit is further introduced to improve the overall feature representation capability. Finally, an adaptive multi-loss function fusion strategy is integrated, allowing for dynamic adjustment of loss weights and overall model optimization. Experimental results on three public datasets, WISDM, PAMAP2, and OPPORTUNITY, demonstrate that the proposed unsupervised data augmentation spatio-temporal attention diffusion network (USAD) achieves accuracies of 98.84%, 93.81%, and 80.92% respectively, significantly outperforming existing approaches. Furthermore, practical deployment on embedded devices verifies the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed method.

Abstract: Recent advancements in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) show that employing group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm for reinforcement learning (RL) training allows the models to use more thinking/reasoning tokens for generating better responses. However, LLMs can generate only a finite amount of tokens while maintaining attention to the previously generated tokens. This limit, also known as the context size of an LLM, is a bottleneck in LLM reasoning with arbitrarily large number of tokens. To think beyond the limit of context size, an LLM must employ a modular thinking strategy to reason over multiple rounds. In this work, we propose $\textbf{MOTIF: Modular Thinking via Reinforcement Finetuning}$ -- an RL training method for generating thinking tokens in multiple rounds, effectively allowing the model to think with additional context size. We trained the open-source model Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter efficient fine-tuning and tested its accuracy on MATH500 and AIME2024 benchmarks. Our experiments show 3.8\% and 3.3\% improvements over vanilla GRPO based training in the respective benchmarks. Furthermore, this improvement was achieved with only 15\% of samples, thus demonstrating sample efficiency of MOTIF. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/purbeshmitra/MOTIF and https://huggingface.co/purbeshmitra/MOTIF, respectively.

Abstract: The recently introduced dependent typed higher-order logic (DHOL) offers an interesting compromise between expressiveness and automation support. It sacrifices the decidability of its type system in order to significantly extend its expressiveness over standard HOL. Yet it retains strong automated theorem proving support via a sound and complete translation to HOL.
  We leverage this design to extend DHOL with refinement and quotient types. Both of these are commonly requested by practitioners but rarely provided by automated theorem provers. This is because they inherently require undecidable typing and thus are very difficult to retrofit to decidable type systems. But with DHOL already doing the heavy lifting, adding them is not only possible but elegant and simple.
  Concretely, we add refinement and quotient types as special cases of subtyping. This turns the associated canonical inclusion resp. projection maps into identity maps and thus avoids costly changes in representation. We present the syntax, semantics, and translation to HOL for the extended language, including the proofs of soundness and completeness.

<title>Answer Matching Outperforms Multiple Choice for Language Model Evaluation</title>

Abstract: Multiple choice benchmarks have long been the workhorse of language model evaluation because grading multiple choice is objective and easy to automate. However, we show multiple choice questions from popular benchmarks can often be answered without even seeing the question. These shortcuts arise from a fundamental limitation of discriminative evaluation not shared by evaluations of the model's free-form, generative answers. Until recently, there appeared to be no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this has changed. We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer matching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it generate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the reference answer to determine if the response matches the reference. To compare the validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and GPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each evaluation approach. We find answer matching using recent models--even small ones--achieves near-perfect agreement, in the range of inter-annotator agreement. In contrast, both multiple choice evaluation and using LLM-as-a-judge without reference answers aligns poorly with human grading. Improving evaluations via answer matching is not merely a conceptual concern: the rankings of several models change significantly when evaluating their free-form responses with answer matching. In light of these findings, we discuss how to move the evaluation ecosystem from multiple choice to answer matching.

Abstract: We propose LiteReality, a novel pipeline that converts RGB-D scans of indoor environments into compact, realistic, and interactive 3D virtual replicas. LiteReality not only reconstructs scenes that visually resemble reality but also supports key features essential for graphics pipelines -- such as object individuality, articulation, high-quality physically based rendering materials, and physically based interaction. At its core, LiteReality first performs scene understanding and parses the results into a coherent 3D layout and objects with the help of a structured scene graph. It then reconstructs the scene by retrieving the most visually similar 3D artist-crafted models from a curated asset database. Next, the Material Painting module enhances realism by recovering high-quality, spatially varying materials. Finally, the reconstructed scene is integrated into a simulation engine with basic physical properties to enable interactive behavior. The resulting scenes are compact, editable, and fully compatible with standard graphics pipelines, making them suitable for applications in AR/VR, gaming, robotics, and digital twins. In addition, LiteReality introduces a training-free object retrieval module that achieves state-of-the-art similarity performance on the Scan2CAD benchmark, along with a robust material painting module capable of transferring appearances from images of any style to 3D assets -- even under severe misalignment, occlusion, and poor lighting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LiteReality on both real-life scans and public datasets. Project page: https://litereality.github.io; Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecK9m3LXg2c

Abstract: Dense 3D scene reconstruction from an ordered sequence or unordered image collections is a critical step when bringing research in computer vision into practical scenarios. Following the paradigm introduced by DUSt3R, which unifies an image pair densely into a shared coordinate system, subsequent methods maintain an implicit memory to achieve dense 3D reconstruction from more images. However, such implicit memory is limited in capacity and may suffer from information loss of earlier frames. We propose Point3R, an online framework targeting dense streaming 3D reconstruction. To be specific, we maintain an explicit spatial pointer memory directly associated with the 3D structure of the current scene. Each pointer in this memory is assigned a specific 3D position and aggregates scene information nearby in the global coordinate system into a changing spatial feature. Information extracted from the latest frame interacts explicitly with this pointer memory, enabling dense integration of the current observation into the global coordinate system. We design a 3D hierarchical position embedding to promote this interaction and design a simple yet effective fusion mechanism to ensure that our pointer memory is uniform and efficient. Our method achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance on various tasks with low training costs. Code is available at: https://github.com/YkiWu/Point3R.

Abstract: We propose a new method for inferring roads from GPS trajectories to map construction sites. This task presents a unique challenge due to the erratic and non-standard movement patterns of construction machinery, which significantly diverge from typical vehicular traffic on established roads. Our proposed method first identifies intersections in the road network that serve as critical decision points, and then connects them with edges to produce a graph, which can subsequently be used for planning and task-allocation. We demonstrate the approach by mapping roads at a real-life construction site in Norway. The method is validated on four increasingly complex segments of the map. In our tests, the method achieved perfect accuracy in detecting intersections and inferring roads in data with no or low noise, while its performance was reduced in areas with significant noise and consistently missing GPS updates.

Abstract: Urban region representation is crucial for various urban downstream tasks. However, despite the proliferation of methods and their success, acquiring general urban region knowledge and adapting to different tasks remains challenging. Existing work pays limited attention to the fine-grained functional layout semantics in urban regions, limiting their ability to capture transferable knowledge across regions. Further, inadequate handling of the unique features and relationships required for different downstream tasks may also hinder effective task adaptation. In this paper, we propose a $\textbf{G}$raph-based $\textbf{U}$rban $\textbf{R}$egion $\textbf{P}$re-training and $\textbf{P}$rompting framework ($\textbf{GURPP}$) for region representation learning. Specifically, we first construct an urban region graph and develop a subgraph-centric urban region pre-training model to capture the heterogeneous and transferable patterns of entity interactions. This model pre-trains knowledge-rich region embeddings using contrastive learning and multi-view learning methods. To further refine these representations, we design two graph-based prompting methods: a manually-defined prompt to incorporate explicit task knowledge and a task-learnable prompt to discover hidden knowledge, which enhances the adaptability of these embeddings to different tasks. Extensive experiments on various urban region prediction tasks and different cities demonstrate the superior performance of our framework.

Abstract: Unsupervised learning methods have a soft inspiration in cognition models. To this day, the most successful unsupervised learning methods revolve around clustering samples in a mathematical space. In this paper we propose a primitive-based, unsupervised learning approach for decision-making inspired by a novel cognition framework. This representation-centric approach models the input space constructively as a distributed hierarchical structure in an input-agnostic way. We compared our approach with both current state-of-the-art unsupervised learning classification, with current state-of-the-art small and incomplete datasets classification, and with current state-of-the-art cancer type classification. We show how our proposal outperforms previous state-of-the-art. We also evaluate some cognition-like properties of our proposal where it not only outperforms the compared algorithms (even supervised learning ones), but it also shows a different, more cognition-like, behaviour.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences remains a key challenge. While post-training techniques like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have achieved notable success, they often introduce computational inefficiencies and training instability. In this paper, we propose Feature-level constrained Preference Optimization (FPO), a novel method designed to simplify the alignment process while ensuring stability. FPO leverages pre-trained Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and introduces feature-level constraints, allowing for efficient, sparsity-enforced alignment. Our approach enjoys efficiency by using sparse features activated in a well-trained sparse autoencoder and the quality of sequential KL divergence by using the feature-level offline reference. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FPO achieves a 5.08% absolute improvement in win rate with much lower computational cost compared to state-of-the-art baselines, making it a promising solution for efficient and controllable LLM alignments.

Abstract: The adoption of Artificial Intelligence in medical imaging holds great promise, yet it remains hindered by challenges such as data scarcity, privacy concerns, and the need for robust multimodal integration. While recent advances in generative modeling have enabled high-quality synthetic data generation, existing approaches are often limited to unimodal, unidirectional synthesis and therefore lack the ability to jointly synthesize multiple modalities while preserving clinical consistency. To address this challenge, we introduce XGeM, a 6.77-billion-parameter multimodal generative model designed to support flexible, any-to-any synthesis between medical data modalities. XGeM constructs a shared latent space via contrastive learning and introduces a novel Multi-Prompt Training strategy, enabling conditioning on arbitrary subsets of input modalities. This design allows the model to adapt to heterogeneous clinical inputs and generate multiple outputs jointly, preserving both semantic and structural coherence. We extensively validate XGeM: first we benchmark it against five competitors on the MIMIC-CXR dataset, a state-of-the-art dataset for multi-view Chest X-ray and radiological report generation. Secondly, we perform a Visual Turing Test with expert radiologists to assess the realism and clinical relevance of the generated data, ensuring alignment with real-world scenarios. Finally, we show how XGeM can support key medical data challenges such as anonymization, class imbalance, and data scarcity, underscoring its utility as a foundation model for medical data synthesis.

Abstract: Pre-trained on extensive text and image corpora, current Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLM) have shown strong capabilities in general visual reasoning tasks. However, their performance is still lacking in physical domains that require understanding diagrams with complex physical structures and quantitative analysis based on multi-modal information. To address this, we develop a new framework, named Multi-Modal Scientific Reasoning with Physics Perception and Simulation (MAPS) based on an MLLM. MAPS decomposes expert-level multi-modal reasoning task into physical diagram understanding via a Physical Perception Model (PPM) and reasoning with physical knowledge via a simulator. The PPM module is obtained by fine-tuning a visual language model using carefully designed synthetic data with paired physical diagrams and corresponding simulation language descriptions. At the inference stage, MAPS integrates the simulation language description of the input diagram provided by PPM and results obtained through a Chain-of-Simulation process with MLLM to derive the underlying rationale and the final answer. Validated using our collected college-level circuit analysis problems, MAPS significantly improves reasoning accuracy of MLLM and outperforms all existing models. The results confirm MAPS offers a promising direction for enhancing multi-modal scientific reasoning ability of MLLMs. We will release our code, model and dataset used for our experiments upon publishing of this paper.

Abstract: AI agents that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly becoming core building blocks of modern software systems. A wide range of frameworks is now available to support the specification of such applications. These frameworks enable the definition of agent setups using natural language prompting, which specifies the roles, goals, and tools assigned to the various agents involved. Within such setups, agent behavior is non-deterministic for any given input, highlighting the critical need for robust debugging and observability tools. In this work, we explore the use of process and causal discovery applied to agent execution trajectories as a means of enhancing developer observability. This approach aids in monitoring and understanding the emergent variability in agent behavior. Additionally, we complement this with LLM-based static analysis techniques to distinguish between intended and unintended behavioral variability. We argue that such instrumentation is essential for giving developers greater control over evolving specifications and for identifying aspects of functionality that may require more precise and explicit definitions.

Abstract: Autoformalization, the process of transforming informal mathematical propositions into verifiable formal representations, is a foundational task in automated theorem proving, offering a new perspective on the use of mathematics in both theoretical and applied domains. Driven by the rapid progress in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), this field has witnessed substantial growth, bringing both new opportunities and unique challenges. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in autoformalization from both mathematical and LLM-centric perspectives. We examine how autoformalization is applied across various mathematical domains and levels of difficulty, and analyze the end-to-end workflow from data preprocessing to model design and evaluation. We further explore the emerging role of autoformalization in enhancing the verifiability of LLM-generated outputs, highlighting its potential to improve both the trustworthiness and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Finally, we summarize key open-source models and datasets supporting current research, and discuss open challenges and promising future directions for the field.

Abstract: In this paper we introduce a Conditional Answer Set Programming framework (Conditional ASP) for the definition of conditional extensions of Answer Set Programming (ASP). The approach builds on a conditional logic with typicality, and on the combination of a conditional knowledge base with an ASP program, and allows for conditional reasoning over the answer sets of the program. The formalism relies on a multi-preferential semantics (and on the KLM preferential semantics, as a special case) to provide an interpretation of conditionals.

Abstract: Pioneered by the foundational information theory by Claude Shannon and the visionary framework of machine intelligence by Alan Turing, the convergent evolution of information and communication technologies (IT/CT) has created an unbroken wave of connectivity and computation. This synergy has sparked a technological revolution, now reaching its peak with large artificial intelligence (AI) models that are reshaping industries and redefining human-machine collaboration. However, the realization of ubiquitous intelligence faces considerable challenges due to substantial resource consumption in large models and high communication bandwidth demands. To address these challenges, AI Flow has been introduced as a multidisciplinary framework that integrates cutting-edge IT and CT advancements, with a particular emphasis on the following three key points. First, device-edge-cloud framework serves as the foundation, which integrates end devices, edge servers, and cloud clusters to optimize scalability and efficiency for low-latency model inference. Second, we introduce the concept of familial models, which refers to a series of different-sized models with aligned hidden features, enabling effective collaboration and the flexibility to adapt to varying resource constraints and dynamic scenarios. Third, connectivity- and interaction-based intelligence emergence is a novel paradigm of AI Flow. By leveraging communication networks to enhance connectivity, the collaboration among AI models across heterogeneous nodes achieves emergent intelligence that surpasses the capability of any single model. The innovations of AI Flow provide enhanced intelligence, timely responsiveness, and ubiquitous accessibility to AI services, paving the way for the tighter fusion of AI techniques and communication systems.

Abstract: Agentic search such as Deep Research systems-where agents autonomously browse the web, synthesize information, and return comprehensive citation-backed answers-represents a major shift in how users interact with web-scale information. While promising greater efficiency and cognitive offloading, the growing complexity and open-endedness of agentic search have outpaced existing evaluation benchmarks and methodologies, which largely assume short search horizons and static answers. In this paper, we introduce Mind2Web 2, a benchmark of 130 realistic, high-quality, and long-horizon tasks that require real-time web browsing and extensive information synthesis, constructed with over 1000 hours of human labor. To address the challenge of evaluating time-varying and complex answers, we propose a novel Agent-as-a-Judge framework. Our method constructs task-specific judge agents based on a tree-structured rubric design to automatically assess both answer correctness and source attribution. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of ten frontier agentic search systems and human performance, along with a detailed error analysis to draw insights for future development. The best-performing system, OpenAI Deep Research, can already achieve 50-70% of human performance while spending half the time, highlighting its great potential. Altogether, Mind2Web 2 provides a rigorous foundation for developing and benchmarking the next generation of agentic search systems.

Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) methods infer an agent's reward function using demonstrations of expert behavior. A Bayesian IRL approach models a distribution over candidate reward functions, capturing a degree of uncertainty in the inferred reward function. This is critical in some applications, such as those involving clinical data. Typically, Bayesian IRL algorithms require large demonstration datasets, which may not be available in practice. In this work, we incorporate existing domain-specific data to achieve better posterior concentration rates. We study a common setting in clinical and biological applications where we have access to expert demonstrations and known reward functions for a set of training tasks. Our aim is to learn the reward function of a new test task given limited expert demonstrations. Existing Bayesian IRL methods impose restrictions on the form of input data, thus limiting the incorporation of training task data. To better leverage information from training tasks, we introduce kernel density Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning (KD-BIRL). Our approach employs a conditional kernel density estimator, which uses the known reward functions of the training tasks to improve the likelihood estimation across a range of reward functions and demonstration samples. Our empirical results highlight KD-BIRL's faster concentration rate in comparison to baselines, particularly in low test task expert demonstration data regimes. Additionally, we are the first to provide theoretical guarantees of posterior concentration for a Bayesian IRL algorithm. Taken together, this work introduces a principled and theoretically grounded framework that enables Bayesian IRL to be applied across a variety of domains.

<title>Beyond Scale: The Diversity Coefficient as a Data Quality Metric for Variability in Natural Language Data</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13840</link>

arXiv:2306.13840v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current trends in pre-training Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily focus on the scaling of model and dataset size. While the quality of pre-training data is considered an important factor for training powerful LLMs, it remains a nebulous concept that has not been rigorously characterized. To this end, we propose a formalization of one key aspect of data quality -- measuring the variability of natural language data -- specifically via a measure we call the diversity coefficient. Our empirical analysis shows that the proposed diversity coefficient aligns with the intuitive properties of diversity and variability, e.g., it increases as the number of latent concepts increases. Then, we measure the diversity coefficient of publicly available pre-training datasets and demonstrate that their formal diversity is high compared to theoretical lower and upper bounds. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive set of controlled interventional experiments with GPT-2 and LLaMAv2 that demonstrate the diversity coefficient of pre-training data characterizes useful aspects of downstream model evaluation performance -- totaling 44 models of various sizes (51M to 7B parameters). We conclude that our formal notion of diversity is an important aspect of data quality that captures variability and causally leads to improved evaluation performance.

<title>Improving the Robustness of Distantly-Supervised Named Entity Recognition via Uncertainty-Aware Teacher Learning and Student-Student Collaborative Learning</title>

arXiv:2311.08010v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distantly-Supervised Named Entity Recognition (DS-NER) is widely used in real-world scenarios. It can effectively alleviate the burden of annotation by matching entities in existing knowledge bases with snippets in the text but suffer from the label noise. Recent works attempt to adopt the teacher-student framework to gradually refine the training labels and improve the overall robustness. However, these teacher-student methods achieve limited performance because the poor calibration of the teacher network produces incorrectly pseudo-labeled samples, leading to error propagation. Therefore, we propose: (1) Uncertainty-Aware Teacher Learning that leverages the prediction uncertainty to reduce the number of incorrect pseudo labels in the self-training stage; (2) Student-Student Collaborative Learning that allows the transfer of reliable labels between two student networks instead of indiscriminately relying on all pseudo labels from its teacher, and further enables a full exploration of mislabeled samples rather than simply filtering unreliable pseudo-labeled samples. We evaluate our proposed method on five DS-NER datasets, demonstrating that our method is superior to the state-of-the-art DS-NER methods.

<title>Avoiding Catastrophe in Online Learning by Asking for Help</title>

Abstract: Most learning algorithms with formal regret guarantees assume that all mistakes are recoverable and essentially rely on trying all possible behaviors. This approach is problematic when some mistakes are "catastrophic", i.e., irreparable. We propose an online learning problem where the goal is to minimize the chance of catastrophe. Specifically, we assume that the payoff in each round represents the chance of avoiding catastrophe in that round and try to maximize the product of payoffs (the overall chance of avoiding catastrophe) while allowing a limited number of queries to a mentor. We also assume that the agent can transfer knowledge between similar inputs. We first show that in general, any algorithm either queries the mentor at a linear rate or is nearly guaranteed to cause catastrophe. However, in settings where the mentor policy class is learnable in the standard online model, we provide an algorithm whose regret and rate of querying the mentor both approach 0 as the time horizon grows. Although our focus is the product of payoffs, we provide matching bounds for the typical additive regret. Conceptually, if a policy class is learnable in the absence of catastrophic risk, it is learnable in the presence of catastrophic risk if the agent can ask for help.

Abstract: The increasing reliance on Deep Learning models, combined with their inherent lack of transparency, has spurred the development of a novel field of study known as eXplainable AI (XAI) methods. These methods seek to enhance the trust of end-users in automated systems by providing insights into the rationale behind their decisions. This paper presents a novel trust measure in XAI systems, allowing their refinement. Our proposed metric combines both performance metrics and trust indicators from an objective perspective. To validate this novel methodology, we conducted three case studies showing an improvement respect the state-of-the-art, with an increased sensitiviy to different scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can generate and revise text with human-level performance. These models come with clear limitations: they can produce inaccurate information, reinforce existing biases, and be easily misused. Yet, many scientists use them for their scholarly writing. But how wide-spread is such LLM usage in the academic literature? To answer this question for the field of biomedical research, we present an unbiased, large-scale approach: we study vocabulary changes in over 15 million biomedical abstracts from 2010--2024 indexed by PubMed, and show how the appearance of LLMs led to an abrupt increase in the frequency of certain style words. This excess word analysis suggests that at least 13.5% of 2024 abstracts were processed with LLMs. This lower bound differed across disciplines, countries, and journals, reaching 40% for some subcorpora. We show that LLMs have had an unprecedented impact on scientific writing in biomedical research, surpassing the effect of major world events such as the Covid pandemic.

Abstract: The growing interest in fair AI development is evident. The ''Leave No One Behind'' initiative urges us to address multiple and intersecting forms of inequality in accessing services, resources, and opportunities, emphasising the significance of fairness in AI. This is particularly relevant as an increasing number of AI tools are applied to decision-making processes, such as resource allocation and service scheme development, across various sectors such as health, energy, and housing. Therefore, exploring joint inequalities in these sectors is significant and valuable for thoroughly understanding overall inequality and unfairness. This research introduces an innovative approach to quantify cross-sectoral intersecting discrepancies among user-defined groups using latent class analysis. These discrepancies can be used to approximate inequality and provide valuable insights to fairness issues. We validate our approach using both proprietary and public datasets, including both EVENS and Census 2021 (England & Wales) datasets, to examine cross-sectoral intersecting discrepancies among different ethnic groups. We also verify the reliability of the quantified discrepancy by conducting a correlation analysis with a government public metric. Our findings reveal significant discrepancies both among minority ethnic groups and between minority ethnic groups and non-minority ethnic groups, emphasising the need for targeted interventions in policy-making processes. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the proposed approach can provide valuable insights into ensuring fairness in machine learning systems.

Abstract: One of the primary catalysts fueling advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) is the availability of massive, curated datasets. A commonly used technique to curate such massive datasets is crowdsourcing, where data are dispatched to multiple annotators. The annotator-produced labels are then fused to serve downstream learning and inference tasks. This annotation process often creates noisy labels due to various reasons, such as the limited expertise, or unreliability of annotators, among others. Therefore, a core objective in crowdsourcing is to develop methods that effectively mitigate the negative impact of such label noise on learning tasks. This feature article introduces advances in learning from noisy crowdsourced labels. The focus is on key crowdsourcing models and their methodological treatments, from classical statistical models to recent deep learning-based approaches, emphasizing analytical insights and algorithmic developments. In particular, this article reviews the connections between signal processing (SP) theory and methods, such as identifiability of tensor and nonnegative matrix factorization, and novel, principled solutions of longstanding challenges in crowdsourcing -- showing how SP perspectives drive the advancements of this field. Furthermore, this article touches upon emerging topics that are critical for developing cutting-edge AI/ML systems, such as crowdsourcing in reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO) that are key techniques for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs).

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) in neuroimaging has become increasingly relevant for detecting neurological conditions and neurodegenerative disorders. One of the most predominant biomarkers in neuroimaging is represented by brain age, which has been shown to be a good indicator for different conditions, such as Alzheimer's Disease. Using brain age for weakly supervised pre-training of DL models in transfer learning settings has also recently shown promising results, especially when dealing with data scarcity of different conditions. On the other hand, anatomical information of brain MRIs (e.g. cortical thickness) can provide important information for learning good representations that can be transferred to many downstream tasks. In this work, we propose AnatCL, an anatomical foundation model for brain MRIs that i.) leverages anatomical information in a weakly contrastive learning approach, and ii.) achieves state-of-the-art performances across many different downstream tasks. To validate our approach we consider 12 different downstream tasks for the diagnosis of different conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease, autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia. Furthermore, we also target the prediction of 10 different clinical assessment scores using structural MRI data. Our findings show that incorporating anatomical information during pre-training leads to more robust and generalizable representations. Pre-trained models can be found at: https://github.com/EIDOSLAB/AnatCL.

Abstract: Echocardiography is an essential medical technique for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases, but its high operational complexity has led to a shortage of trained professionals. To address this issue, we introduce a novel probe movement guidance algorithm that has the potential to be applied in guiding robotic systems or novices with probe pose adjustment for high-quality standard plane image acquisition.Cardiac ultrasound faces two major challenges: (1) the inherently complex structure of the heart, and (2) significant individual variations. Previous works have only learned the population-averaged structure of the heart rather than personalized cardiac structures, leading to a performance bottleneck. Clinically, we observe that sonographers dynamically adjust their interpretation of a patient's cardiac anatomy based on prior scanning sequences, consequently refining their scanning strategies. Inspired by this, we propose a novel sequence-aware self-supervised pre-training method. Specifically, our approach learns personalized three-dimensional cardiac structural features by predicting the masked-out image features and probe movement actions in a scanning sequence. We hypothesize that if the model can predict the missing content it has acquired a good understanding of personalized cardiac structure. Extensive experiments on a large-scale expert scanning dataset with 1.31 million samples demonstrate that our proposed sequence-aware paradigm can effectively reduce probe guidance errors compared to other advanced baseline methods. Our code will be released after acceptance.

Abstract: Much of the cost and effort required during the software testing process is invested in performing test maintenance - the addition, removal, or modification of test cases to keep the test suite in sync with the system-under-test or to otherwise improve its quality. Tool support could reduce the cost - and improve the quality - of test maintenance by automating aspects of the process or by providing guidance and support to developers.
  In this study, we explore the capabilities and applications of large language models (LLMs) - complex machine learning models adapted to textual analysis - to support test maintenance. We conducted a case study at Ericsson AB where we explore the triggers that indicate the need for test maintenance, the actions that LLMs can take, and the considerations that must be made when deploying LLMs in an industrial setting. We also propose and demonstrate a multi-agent architecture that can predict which tests require maintenance following a change to the source code. Collectively, these contributions advance our theoretical and practical understanding of how LLMs can be deployed to benefit industrial test maintenance processes.

<title>Reconsidering the energy efficiency of spiking neural networks</title>

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise higher energy efficiency over conventional Quantized Artificial Neural Networks (QNNs) due to their event-driven, spike-based computation. However, prevailing energy evaluations often oversimplify, focusing on computational aspects while neglecting critical overheads like comprehensive data movement and memory access. Such simplifications can lead to misleading conclusions regarding the true energy benefits of SNNs. This paper presents a rigorous re-evaluation. We establish a fair baseline by mapping rate-encoded SNNs with $T$ timesteps to functionally equivalent QNNs with $\lceil \log_2(T+1) \rceil$ bits. This ensures both models have comparable representational capacities, as well has similar hardware requirement, enabling meaningful energy comparisons. We introduce a detailed analytical energy model encompassing core computation and data movement (sparse and dense activations, weights). Using this model, we systematically explore a wide parameter space, including intrinsic network characteristics ($T$, spike rate $s_r$, QNN sparsity $\gamma$, model size $N$, weight bit-level) and hardware characteristics (memory system and network-on-chip). Our analysis identifies specific operational regimes where SNNs genuinely offer superior energy efficiency. For example, under typical neuromorphic hardware conditions, SNNs with moderate time windows ($T \in [5,10]$) require an average spike rate ($s_r$) below 6.4% to outperform equivalent QNNs. These insights guide the design of genuinely energy-efficient neural network solutions.

<title>Offline Reinforcement Learning for Learning to Dispatch for Job Shop Scheduling</title>

Abstract: The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is a complex combinatorial optimization problem. While online Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise by quickly finding acceptable solutions for JSSP, it faces key limitations: it requires extensive training interactions from scratch leading to sample inefficiency, cannot leverage existing high-quality solutions from traditional methods like Constraint Programming (CP), and require simulated environments to train in, which are impracticable to build for complex scheduling environments. We introduce Offline Learned Dispatching (Offline-LD), an offline reinforcement learning approach for JSSP, which addresses these limitations by learning from historical scheduling data. Our approach is motivated by scenarios where historical scheduling data and expert solutions are available or scenarios where online training of RL approaches with simulated environments is impracticable. Offline-LD introduces maskable variants of two Q-learning methods, namely, Maskable Quantile Regression DQN (mQRDQN) and discrete maskable Soft Actor-Critic (d-mSAC), that are able to learn from historical data, through Conservative Q-Learning (CQL). Moreover, we present a novel entropy bonus modification for d-mSAC, for maskable action spaces. Moreover, we introduce a novel reward normalization method for JSSP in an offline RL setting. Our experiments demonstrate that Offline-LD outperforms online RL on both generated and benchmark instances when trained on only 100 solutions generated by CP. Notably, introducing noise to the expert dataset yields comparable or superior results to using the expert dataset, with the same amount of instances, a promising finding for real-world applications, where data is inherently noisy and imperfect.

It remains challenging due to the complex spatial relationships in outdoor aerial scenes. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end zero-shot framework for aerial VLN tasks, where the large language model (LLM) is introduced as our agent for action prediction. Specifically, we develop a novel Semantic-Topo-Metric Representation (STMR) to enhance the spatial reasoning ability of LLMs. This is achieved by extracting and projecting instruction-related semantic masks of landmarks into a top-down map that contains the location information of surrounding landmarks. Further, this map is transformed into a matrix representation with distance metrics as the text prompt to the LLM, for action prediction according to the instruction. Experiments conducted in real and simulation environments have successfully proved the effectiveness and robustness of our method, achieving 15.9% and 12.5% improvements (absolute) in Oracle Success Rate (OSR) on AerialVLN-S dataset.

Abstract: Complex query answering (CQA) on knowledge graphs (KGs) is gaining momentum as a challenging reasoning task. In this paper, we show that the current benchmarks for CQA might not be as complex as we think, as the way they are built distorts our perception of progress in this field. For example, we find that in these benchmarks, most queries (up to 98% for some query types) can be reduced to simpler problems, e.g., link prediction, where only one link needs to be predicted. The performance of state-of-the-art CQA models decreases significantly when such models are evaluated on queries that cannot be reduced to easier types. Thus, we propose a set of more challenging benchmarks composed of queries that require models to reason over multiple hops and better reflect the construction of real-world KGs. In a systematic empirical investigation, the new benchmarks show that current methods leave much to be desired from current CQA methods.

<title>Next-Token Prediction Task Assumes Optimal Data Ordering for LLM Training in Proof Generation</title>

Abstract: In the field of large language model (LLM)-based proof generation, despite extensive training on large datasets such as ArXiv, LLMs still exhibit only modest performance on proving tasks of moderate difficulty. We believe that this is partly due to the widespread presence of suboptimal ordering within the data for each proof used in training. For example, published proofs often follow a purely logical order, where each step logically proceeds from the previous steps based on the deductive rules. This order is designed to facilitate the verification of the proof's soundness, rather than to help people and models learn the discovery process of the proof. In proof generation, we argue that the optimal order for one training data sample occurs when the relevant intermediate supervision for a particular proof step in the proof is always positioned to the left of that proof step. We call such order the intuitively sequential order. We validate our claims using two tasks: intuitionistic propositional logic theorem-proving and digit multiplication. Our experiments verify the order effect and provide support for our explanations. We demonstrate that training is most effective when the proof is in the intuitively sequential order. Moreover, the order effect and the performance gap between models trained on different data orders can be substantial -- with an 11 percent improvement in proof success rate observed in the propositional logic theorem-proving task, between models trained on the optimal order compared to the worst order. Lastly, we define a common type of order issue in advanced math proofs and find that 17.3 percent of theorems with nontrivial proofs in the first two chapters of a widely used graduate-level mathematics textbook suffer from this issue. A detailed list of those proofs is provided in the appendix.

Abstract: With the proliferation of devices on the Internet of Things (IoT), ensuring their security has become paramount. Device identification (DI), which distinguishes IoT devices based on their traffic patterns, plays a crucial role in both differentiating devices and identifying vulnerable ones, closing a serious security gap. However, existing approaches to DI that build machine learning models often overlook the challenge of model generalizability across diverse network environments. In this study, we propose a novel framework to address this limitation and to evaluate the generalizability of DI models across data sets collected within different network environments. Our approach involves a two-step process: first, we develop a feature and model selection method that is more robust to generalization issues by using a genetic algorithm with external feedback and datasets from distinct environments to refine the selections. Second, the resulting DI models are then tested on further independent datasets to robustly assess their generalizability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by empirically comparing it to alternatives, highlighting how fundamental limitations of commonly employed techniques such as sliding window and flow statistics limit their generalizability. Moreover, we show that statistical methods, widely used in the literature, are unreliable for device identification due to their dependence on network-specific characteristics rather than device-intrinsic properties, challenging the validity of a significant portion of existing research. Our findings advance research in IoT security and device identification, offering insight into improving model effectiveness and mitigating risks in IoT networks.

Abstract: Recently, with the emergence of recent Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) technology, it has become possible to exploit its video understanding capability on different classification tasks. In practice, we face the difficulty of huge requirements for GPU resource if we need to deploy MLLMs online. In this paper, we propose COEF-VQ, a novel cascaded MLLM framework designed to enhance video quality understanding on the short-video platform while optimizing computational efficiency. Our approach integrates an entropy-based pre-filtering stage, where a lightweight model assesses uncertainty and selectively filters cases before passing them to the more computationally intensive MLLM for final evaluation. By prioritizing high-uncertainty samples for deeper analysis, our framework significantly reduces GPU usage while maintaining the strong classification performance of a full MLLM deployment. To demonstrate the effectiveness of COEF-VQ, we deploy this new framework onto the video management platform (VMP) at the short-video platform, and perform a series of detailed experiments on two in-house tasks related to video quality understanding. We show that COEF-VQ leads to substantial performance gains from the offline evaluation in these two tasks and effectively enhances platform safety with limit resource consumption, significantly reducing inappropriate content video view rate by 9.9% in a online A/B test without affecting engagement. Post-launch monitoring confirmed sustained improvements, validating its real-world impact.

<title>Token Prepending: A Training-Free Approach for Eliciting Better Sentence Embeddings from LLMs</title>

Abstract: Extracting sentence embeddings from large language models (LLMs) is a promising direction, as LLMs have demonstrated stronger semantic understanding capabilities. Previous studies typically focus on prompt engineering to elicit sentence embeddings from LLMs by prompting the model to encode sentence information into the embedding of the last token. However, LLMs are mostly decoder-only models with causal attention and the earlier tokens in the sentence cannot attend to the latter tokens, resulting in biased encoding of sentence information and cascading effects on the final decoded token. To this end, we propose a novel Token Prepending (TP) technique that prepends each layer's decoded sentence embedding to the beginning of the sentence in the next layer's input, allowing earlier tokens to attend to the complete sentence information under the causal attention mechanism. The proposed TP technique is a plug-and-play and training-free technique, which means it can be seamlessly integrated with various prompt-based sentence embedding methods and autoregressive LLMs. Extensive experiments on various Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) tasks and downstream classification tasks demonstrate that our proposed TP technique can significantly improve the performance of existing prompt-based sentence embedding methods across different LLMs, while incurring negligible additional inference cost.

<title>On Characterizations for Language Generation: Interplay of Hallucinations, Breadth, and Stability</title>

Abstract: We study language generation in the limit - introduced by Kleinberg and Mullainathan [KM24] - building on classical works of Gold [Gol67] and Angluin [Ang79]. [KM24]'s main result is an algorithm for generating from any countable language collection in the limit. While their algorithm eventually generates unseen strings from the target language $K$, it sacrifices coverage or breadth, i.e., its ability to generate a rich set of strings. Recent work introduces different notions of breadth and explores when generation with breadth is possible, leaving a full characterization of these notions open. Our first set of results settles this by characterizing generation for existing notions of breadth and their natural extensions. Interestingly, our lower bounds are very flexible and hold for many performance metrics beyond breadth - for instance, showing that, in general, it is impossible to train generators which achieve a higher perplexity or lower hallucination rate for $K$ compared to other languages. Next, we study language generation with breadth and stable generators - algorithms that eventually stop changing after seeing an arbitrary but finite number of strings - and prove unconditional lower bounds for such generators, strengthening the results of [KMV25] and demonstrating that generation with many existing notions of breadth becomes equally hard, when stability is required. This gives a separation for generation with approximate breadth, between stable and unstable generators, highlighting the rich interplay between breadth, stability, and consistency in language generation.

<title>Quantum-enhanced causal discovery for a small number of samples</title>

Abstract: The discovery of causal relations from observed data has attracted significant interest from disciplines such as economics, social sciences, and biology. In practical applications, considerable knowledge of the underlying systems is often unavailable, and real data are usually associated with nonlinear causal structures, which makes the direct use of most conventional causality analysis methods difficult. This study proposes a novel quantum Peter-Clark (qPC) algorithm for causal discovery that does not require any assumptions about the underlying model structures. Based on conditional independence tests in a class of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces characterized by quantum circuits, the proposed algorithm can explore causal relations from the observed data drawn from arbitrary distributions. We conducted systematic experiments on fundamental graphs of causal structures, demonstrating that the qPC algorithm exhibits better performance, particularly with smaller sample sizes compared to its classical counterpart. Furthermore, we proposed a novel optimization approach based on Kernel Target Alignment (KTA) for determining hyperparameters of quantum kernels. This method effectively reduced the risk of false positives in causal discovery, enabling more reliable inference. Our theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the quantum algorithm can empower classical algorithms for accurate inference in causal discovery, supporting them in regimes where classical algorithms typically fail. In addition, the effectiveness of this method was validated using the datasets on Boston housing prices, heart disease, and biological signaling systems as real-world applications. These findings highlight the potential of quantum-based causal discovery methods in addressing practical challenges, particularly in small-sample scenarios, where traditional approaches have shown significant limitations.

Abstract: Contrary to the conventional emphasis on dataset size, we explore the role of data alignment -- an often overlooked aspect of data quality -- in training capable Large Language Models (LLMs). To do so, we use the Task2Vec-based alignment coefficient, a quantitative measure of the similarity between two datasets, to quantify the impact of alignment between training data and evaluation data on downstream performance. In particular, we conduct controlled \textit{interventional} experiments for two settings: 1. the impact of increased alignment coefficients between various pre-training (pt) against evaluation datasets, and 2. the impact of increased alignment coefficients between domain specific fine-tuning (ft) against domain specific evaluation. The domain specific task we explore is Autoformalization -- the machine translation task between natural language and code for formal verification. In both settings, we find a strong, predictable negative correlation between the alignment coefficient of a model's training and evaluation data and the model's loss/perplexity on the respective downstream task. These findings suggest a re-evaluation of LLM training approaches, demonstrating the relevance of data alignment compared to data quantity, especially in specialized downstream tasks such as Autoformalization.

<title>Parameters vs FLOPs: Scaling Laws for Optimal Sparsity for Mixture-of-Experts Language Models</title>

Abstract: Scaling the capacity of language models has consistently proven to be a reliable approach for improving performance and unlocking new capabilities. Capacity can be primarily defined by two dimensions: the number of model parameters and the compute per example. While scaling typically involves increasing both, the precise interplay between these factors and their combined contribution to overall capacity remains not fully understood. We explore this relationship in the context of sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs), which allow scaling the number of parameters without proportionally increasing the FLOPs per example. We investigate how varying the sparsity level, i.e., the fraction of inactive parameters, impacts model's performance during pretraining and downstream few-shot evaluation. We find that under different constraints (e.g., parameter size and total training compute), there is an optimal level of sparsity that improves both training efficiency and model performance. These results provide a better understanding of the impact of sparsity in scaling laws for MoEs and complement existing works in this area, offering insights for designing more efficient architectures.

Abstract: Tree-based Genetic Programming (TGP) is a widely used evolutionary algorithm for tasks such as symbolic regression, classification, and robotic control. Due to the intensive computational demands of running TGP, GPU acceleration is crucial for achieving scalable performance. However, efficient GPU-based execution of TGP still remains challenging, primarily due to three core issues: (1) the structural heterogeneity of program individuals, (2) the complexity of integrating multiple levels of parallelism, and (3) the incompatibility between high-performance CUDA execution and flexible Python-based environments. To address these issues, we propose EvoGP, a high-performance framework tailored for comprehensive GPU acceleration of TGP via population-level parallel execution. First, EvoGP introduces a tensorized representation that encodes variable-sized trees into fixed-shape, memory-aligned arrays, enabling uniform memory access and parallel computation across diverse individuals. Second, EvoGP adopts an adaptive parallelism strategy that dynamically combines intra- and inter-individual parallelism based on dataset size, ensuring high GPU utilization across a broad spectrum of tasks. Third, EvoGP embeds custom CUDA kernels into the PyTorch runtime, achieving seamless integration with Python-based environments such as Gym, MuJoCo, Brax, and Genesis. Comprehensive experiments show that EvoGP achieves up to 140x speedup over state-of-the-art GPU-based TGP implementations, while maintaining competitive accuracy and significantly improving scalability under large population sizes. EvoGP is open source and accessible at: https://github.com/EMI-Group/evogp.

Abstract: Accurate detection of traffic anomalies is crucial for effective urban traffic management and congestion mitigation. We use the Spatiotemporal Generative Adversarial Network (STGAN) framework combining Graph Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks to capture complex spatial and temporal dependencies in traffic data. We apply STGAN to real-time, minute-by-minute observations from 42 traffic cameras across Gothenburg, Sweden, collected over several months in 2020. The images are processed to compute a flow metric representing vehicle density, which serves as input for the model. Training is conducted on data from April to November 2020, and validation is performed on a separate dataset from November 14 to 23, 2020. Our results demonstrate that the model effectively detects traffic anomalies with high precision and low false positive rates. The detected anomalies include camera signal interruptions, visual artifacts, and extreme weather conditions affecting traffic flow.

Abstract: The rapid growth of large models has raised concerns about their environmental impact and equity in accessibility due to significant computational costs. Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA) offer a lightweight solution for finetuning large models, resulting in an abundance of publicly available adapters tailored to diverse domains. We ask: Can these pretrained adapters be leveraged to further streamline adaptation to new tasks while addressing these challenges? We introduce EigenLoRAx, a parameter-efficient finetuning method that recycles existing adapters to create a principal subspace aligned with their shared domain knowledge which can be further augmented with orthogonal basis vectors in low-resource scenarios. This enables rapid adaptation to new tasks by learning only lightweight coefficients on the principal components of the subspace-eliminating the need to finetune entire adapters. EigenLoRAx requires significantly fewer parameters and memory, improving efficiency for both training and inference. Our method demonstrates strong performance across diverse domains and tasks, offering a scalable for edge-based applications, personalization, and equitable deployment of large models in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: The study of mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer a model to explain its behaviors. While recent studies have focused on the static mechanism of a certain behavior, the learning dynamics inside a model remain to be explored. In this work, we develop an interpretable fine-tuning method for analyzing the mechanism behind learning. We first introduce the concept of node-level intrinsic dimensionality to describe the learning process of a model in a computational graph. Based on our theory, we propose circuit-tuning, a two-stage algorithm that iteratively builds the minimal subgraph for a specific task and updates the key parameters in a heuristic way. Experimental results confirm the existence of the intrinsic dimensionality at the node level and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for transparent and interpretable fine-tuning. We visualize and analyze the circuits before, during, and after fine-tuning, providing new insights into the self-organization mechanism of a neural network in the learning process.

arXiv:2502.06684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent foundational models for tabular data, such as TabPFN, excel at adapting to new tasks via in-context learning, but remain constrained to a fixed, pre-defined number of target dimensions-often necessitating costly ensembling strategies. We trace this constraint to a deeper architectural shortcoming: these models lack target equivariance, so that permuting target dimension orderings alters their predictions. This deficiency gives rise to an irreducible "equivariance gap", an error term that introduces instability in predictions. We eliminate this gap by designing a fully target-equivariant architecture-ensuring permutation invariance via equivariant encoders, decoders, and a bi-attention mechanism. Empirical evaluation on standard classification benchmarks shows that, on datasets with more classes than those seen during pre-training, our model matches or surpasses existing methods while incurring lower computational overhead.

arXiv:2502.13450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Interleaved Gibbs Diffusion (IGD), a novel generative modeling framework for discrete-continuous data, focusing on problems with important, implicit and unspecified constraints in the data. Most prior works on discrete and discrete-continuous diffusion assume a factorized denoising distribution, which can hinder the modeling of strong dependencies between random variables in such problems. We empirically demonstrate a significant improvement in 3-SAT performance out of the box by switching to a Gibbs-sampling style discrete diffusion model which does not assume factorizability. Motivated by this, we introduce IGD which generalizes discrete time Gibbs sampling type Markov chain for the case of discrete-continuous generation. IGD allows for seamless integration between discrete and continuous denoisers while theoretically guaranteeing exact reversal of a suitable forward process. Further, it provides flexibility in the choice of denoisers, allows conditional generation via state-space doubling and inference time refinement. Empirical evaluations on three challenging generation tasks - molecule structures, layouts and tabular data - demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, IGD achieves state-of-the-art results without relying on domain-specific inductive biases like equivariant diffusion or auxiliary losses. We explore a wide range of modeling, and interleaving strategies along with hyperparameters in each of these problems.

Abstract: Postprandial hyperglycemia, marked by the blood glucose level exceeding the normal range after consuming a meal, is a critical indicator of progression toward type 2 diabetes in people with prediabetes and in healthy individuals. A key metric for understanding blood glucose dynamics after eating is the postprandial area under the curve (AUC). Predicting postprandial AUC in advance based on a person's lifestyle factors, such as diet and physical activity level, and explaining the factors that affect postprandial blood glucose could allow an individual to adjust their lifestyle accordingly to maintain normal glucose levels. In this study, we developed an explainable machine learning solution, GlucoLens, that takes sensor-driven inputs and uses advanced data processing, large language models, and trainable machine learning models to predict postprandial AUC and hyperglycemia from diet, physical activity, and recent glucose patterns. We used data obtained from wearables in a five-week clinical trial of 10 adults who worked full-time to develop and evaluate the proposed computational model that integrates wearable sensing, multimodal data, and machine learning. Our machine learning model takes multimodal data from wearable activity and glucose monitoring sensors, along with food and work logs, and provides an interpretable prediction of the postprandial glucose pattern. Our GlucoLens system achieves a normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) of 0.123 in its best configuration. On average, the proposed technology provides a 16% better performance level compared to the comparison models. Additionally, our technique predicts hyperglycemia with an accuracy of 73.3% and an F1 score of 0.716 and recommends different treatment options to help avoid hyperglycemia through diverse counterfactual explanations.

Abstract: Secure aggregation is motivated by federated learning (FL) where a cloud server aims to compute an averaged model (i.e., weights of deep neural networks) of the locally-trained models of numerous clients, while adhering to data security requirements. Hierarchical secure aggregation (HSA) extends this concept to a three-layer hierarchical network, where clustered users communicate with the server through an intermediate layer of relays. In HSA, beyond conventional server security, relay security is also enforced to ensure that the relays remain oblivious to the users' inputs (an abstraction of the local models in FL). Existing study on HSA assumes that each user is associated with only one relay, limiting opportunities for coding across inter-cluster users to achieve efficient communication and key generation. In this paper, we consider HSA with a cyclic association pattern where each user is connected to $B$ consecutive relays in a wrap-around manner. We propose an efficient aggregation scheme which includes a message design for the inputs inspired by gradient coding-a well-known technique for efficient communication in distributed computing-along with a highly non-trivial security key design. We also derive novel converse bounds on the minimum achievable communication and key rates using information-theoretic arguments.

Abstract: Illumination estimation remains a pivotal challenge in image processing, particularly for robotics, where robust environmental perception is essential under varying lighting conditions. Traditional approaches, such as RGB histograms and GIST descriptors, often fail in complex scenarios due to their sensitivity to illumination changes. This study introduces a novel method utilizing the Wasserstein distance, rooted in optimal transport theory, to estimate illuminant and light direction in images. Experiments on diverse images indoor scenes, black-and-white photographs, and night images demonstrate the method's efficacy in detecting dominant light sources and estimating their directions, outperforming traditional statistical methods in complex lighting environments. The approach shows promise for applications in light source localization, image quality assessment, and object detection enhancement. Future research may explore adaptive thresholding and integrate gradient analysis to enhance accuracy, offering a scalable solution for real-world illumination challenges in robotics and beyond.

Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) based tools for 3D phenotyping, especially for maize, has been limited due to the lack of large and diverse 3D datasets. 2D image datasets fail to capture essential structural details such as leaf architecture, plant volume, and spatial arrangements that 3D data provide. To address this limitation, we present MaizeField3D (https://baskargroup.github.io/MaizeField3D/), a curated dataset of 3D point clouds of field-grown maize plants from a diverse genetic panel, designed to be AI-ready for advancing agricultural research. Our dataset includes 1,045 high-quality point clouds of field-grown maize collected using a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS). Point clouds of 520 plants from this dataset were segmented and annotated using a graph-based segmentation method to isolate individual leaves and stalks, ensuring consistent labeling across all samples. This labeled data was then used for fitting procedural models that provide a structured parametric representation of the maize plants. The leaves of the maize plants in the procedural models are represented using Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) surfaces that were generated using a two-step optimization process combining gradient-free and gradient-based methods. We conducted rigorous manual quality control on all datasets, correcting errors in segmentation, ensuring accurate leaf ordering, and validating metadata annotations. The dataset also includes metadata detailing plant morphology and quality, alongside multi-resolution subsampled point cloud data (100k, 50k, 10k points), which can be readily used for different downstream computational tasks. MaizeField3D will serve as a comprehensive foundational dataset for AI-driven phenotyping, plant structural analysis, and 3D applications in agricultural research.

<title>HAPI: A Model for Learning Robot Facial Expressions from Human Preferences</title>

Abstract: Automatic robotic facial expression generation is crucial for human-robot interaction, as handcrafted methods based on fixed joint configurations often yield rigid and unnatural behaviors. Although recent automated techniques reduce the need for manual tuning, they tend to fall short by not adequately bridging the gap between human preferences and model predictions-resulting in a deficiency of nuanced and realistic expressions due to limited degrees of freedom and insufficient perceptual integration. In this work, we propose a novel learning-to-rank framework that leverages human feedback to address this discrepancy and enhanced the expressiveness of robotic faces. Specifically, we conduct pairwise comparison annotations to collect human preference data and develop the Human Affective Pairwise Impressions (HAPI) model, a Siamese RankNet-based approach that refines expression evaluation. Results obtained via Bayesian Optimization and online expression survey on a 35-DOF android platform demonstrate that our approach produces significantly more realistic and socially resonant expressions of Anger, Happiness, and Surprise than those generated by baseline and expert-designed methods. This confirms that our framework effectively bridges the gap between human preferences and model predictions while robustly aligning robotic expression generation with human affective responses.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used for medical imaging tasks. However, there can be biases in AI models, particularly when they are trained using imbalanced training datasets. One such example has been the strong ethnicity bias effect in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) image segmentation models. Although this phenomenon has been reported in a number of publications, little is known about the effectiveness of bias mitigation algorithms in this domain. We aim to investigate the impact of common bias mitigation methods to address bias between Black and White subjects in AI-based CMR segmentation models. Specifically, we use oversampling, importance reweighing and Group DRO as well as combinations of these techniques to mitigate the ethnicity bias. Second, motivated by recent findings on the root causes of AI-based CMR segmentation bias, we evaluate the same methods using models trained and evaluated on cropped CMR images. We find that bias can be mitigated using oversampling, significantly improving performance for the underrepresented Black subjects whilst not significantly reducing the majority White subjects' performance. Using cropped images increases performance for both ethnicities and reduces the bias, whilst adding oversampling as a bias mitigation technique with cropped images reduces the bias further. When testing the models on an external clinical validation set, we find high segmentation performance and no statistically significant bias.

<title>Commander-GPT: Fully Unleashing the Sarcasm Detection Capability of Multi-Modal Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Sarcasm detection, as a crucial research direction in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), has attracted widespread attention. Traditional sarcasm detection tasks have typically focused on single-modal approaches (e.g., text), but due to the implicit and subtle nature of sarcasm, such methods often fail to yield satisfactory results. In recent years, researchers have shifted the focus of sarcasm detection to multi-modal approaches. However, effectively leveraging multi-modal information to accurately identify sarcastic content remains a challenge that warrants further exploration. Leveraging the powerful integrated processing capabilities of Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for various information sources, we propose an innovative multi-modal Commander-GPT framework. Inspired by military strategy, we first decompose the sarcasm detection task into six distinct sub-tasks. A central commander (decision-maker) then assigns the best-suited large language model to address each specific sub-task. Ultimately, the detection results from each model are aggregated to identify sarcasm. We conducted extensive experiments on MMSD and MMSD 2.0, utilizing four multi-modal large language models and six prompting strategies. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 19.3% improvement in F1 score, without necessitating fine-tuning or ground-truth rationales.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a fundamental technology for numerous human - centered intelligent applications. Although deep learning methods have been utilized to accelerate feature extraction, issues such as multimodal data mixing, activity heterogeneity, and complex model deployment remain largely unresolved. The aim of this paper is to address issues such as multimodal data mixing, activity heterogeneity, and complex model deployment in sensor-based human activity recognition. We propose a spatiotemporal attention modal decomposition alignment fusion strategy to tackle the problem of the mixed distribution of sensor data. Key discriminative features of activities are captured through cross-modal spatio-temporal disentangled representation, and gradient modulation is combined to alleviate data heterogeneity. In addition, a wearable deployment simulation system is constructed. We conducted experiments on a large number of public datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the model.

Abstract: Reliable tumor segmentation in thoracic computed tomography (CT) remains challenging due to boundary ambiguity, class imbalance, and anatomical variability. We propose an uncertainty-guided, coarse-to-fine segmentation framework that combines full-volume tumor localization with refined region-of-interest (ROI) segmentation, enhanced by anatomically aware post-processing. The first-stage model generates a coarse prediction, followed by anatomically informed filtering based on lung overlap, proximity to lung surfaces, and component size. The resulting ROIs are segmented by a second-stage model trained with uncertainty-aware loss functions to improve accuracy and boundary calibration in ambiguous regions. Experiments on private and public datasets demonstrate improvements in Dice and Hausdorff scores, with fewer false positives and enhanced spatial interpretability. These results highlight the value of combining uncertainty modeling and anatomical priors in cascaded segmentation pipelines for robust and clinically meaningful tumor delineation. On the Orlando dataset, our framework improved Swin UNETR Dice from 0.4690 to 0.6447. Reduction in spurious components was strongly correlated with segmentation gains, underscoring the value of anatomically informed post-processing.

Abstract: The operating room (OR) is a complex environment where optimizing workflows is critical to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. While computer vision approaches for automatic recognition of perioperative events can identify bottlenecks for OR optimization, privacy concerns limit the use of OR videos for automated event detection. We propose a two-stage pipeline for privacy-preserving OR video analysis and event detection. First, we leverage vision foundation models for depth estimation and semantic segmentation to generate de-identified Digital Twins (DT) of the OR from conventional RGB videos. Second, we employ the SafeOR model, a fused two-stream approach that processes segmentation masks and depth maps for OR event detection. Evaluation on an internal dataset of 38 simulated surgical trials with five event classes shows that our DT-based approach achieves performance on par with -- and sometimes better than -- raw RGB video-based models for OR event detection. Digital Twins enable privacy-preserving OR workflow analysis, facilitating the sharing of de-identified data across institutions and potentially enhancing model generalizability by mitigating domain-specific appearance differences.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) faces a challenge in balancing the exploration of expressive, broad search spaces that enable architectural innovation with the need for efficient evaluation of architectures to effectively search such spaces. We investigate surrogate model training for improving search in highly expressive NAS search spaces based on context-free grammars. We show that i) surrogate models trained either using zero-cost-proxy metrics and neural graph features (GRAF) or by fine-tuning an off-the-shelf LM have high predictive power for the performance of architectures both within and across datasets, ii) these surrogates can be used to filter out bad architectures when searching on novel datasets, thereby significantly speeding up search and achieving better final performances, and iii) the surrogates can be further used directly as the search objective for huge speed-ups.

Abstract: Agreement measures, such as Cohen's kappa or intraclass correlation, gauge the matching between two or more classifiers. They are used in a wide range of contexts from medicine, where they evaluate the effectiveness of medical treatments and clinical trials, to artificial intelligence, where they can quantify the approximation due to the reduction of a classifier. The consistency of different classifiers to a golden standard can be compared simply by using the order induced by their agreement measure with respect to the golden standard itself. Nevertheless, labelling an approach as good or bad exclusively by using the value of an agreement measure requires a scale or a significativity index. Some quality scales have been proposed in the literature for Cohen's kappa, but they are mainly na\"ive, and their boundaries are arbitrary. This work proposes a general approach to evaluate the significativity of any agreement value between two classifiers and introduces two significativity indices: one dealing with finite data sets, the other one handling classification probability distributions. Moreover, this manuscript addresses the computational challenges of evaluating such indices and proposes some efficient algorithms for their evaluation.

arXiv:2504.19136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fusion of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and RGB imagery for land cover classification remains challenging due to modality heterogeneity and underutilized spectral complementarity. Existing methods often fail to decouple shared structural features from modality-complementary radiometric attributes, causing feature conflicts and information loss. To address this, we propose Phase-Amplitude Decoupling (PAD), a frequency-aware framework that separates phase (modality-shared) and amplitude (modality-complementary) components in the Fourier domain, thus reinforcing shared structures while preserving complementary characteristics to improve fusion quality. Unlike prior approaches that overlook the distinct physical properties encoded in frequency spectra, PAD is the first to introduce explicit amplitude-phase decoupling for multi-modal fusion. Specifically, PAD comprises two key components: 1) Phase Spectrum Correction (PSC), which aligns cross-modal phase features via convolution-guided scaling to enhance geometric consistency; and 2) Amplitude Spectrum Fusion (ASF), which dynamically integrates high-frequency and low-frequency patterns using frequency-adaptive multilayer perceptrons, leveraging SAR's morphological sensitivity and RGB's spectral richness. Extensive experiments on WHU-OPT-SAR and DDHR-SK datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Our work establishes a new paradigm for physics-aware multi-modal fusion in remote sensing. The code will be available at https://github.com/RanFeng2/PAD.

Abstract: This paper introduces SoccerDiffusion, a transformer-based diffusion model designed to learn end-to-end control policies for humanoid robot soccer directly from real-world gameplay recordings. Using data collected from RoboCup competitions, the model predicts joint command trajectories from multi-modal sensor inputs, including vision, proprioception, and game state. We employ a distillation technique to enable real-time inference on embedded platforms that reduces the multi-step diffusion process to a single step. Our results demonstrate the model's ability to replicate complex motion behaviors such as walking, kicking, and fall recovery both in simulation and on physical robots. Although high-level tactical behavior remains limited, this work provides a robust foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning or preference optimization methods. We release the dataset, pretrained models, and code under: https://bit-bots.github.io/SoccerDiffusion

<title>Threat Modeling for AI: The Case for an Asset-Centric Approach</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in AI are transforming AI's ubiquitous presence in our world from that of standalone AI-applications into deeply integrated AI-agents. These changes have been driven by agents' increasing capability to autonomously make decisions and initiate actions, using existing applications; whether those applications are AI-based or not. This evolution enables unprecedented levels of AI integration, with agents now able to take actions on behalf of systems and users -- including, in some cases, the powerful ability for the AI to write and execute scripts as it deems necessary. With AI systems now able to autonomously execute code, interact with external systems, and operate without human oversight, traditional security approaches fall short.
  This paper introduces an asset-centric methodology for threat modeling AI systems that addresses the unique security challenges posed by integrated AI agents. Unlike existing top-down frameworks that analyze individual attacks within specific product contexts, our bottom-up approach enables defenders to systematically identify how vulnerabilities -- both conventional and AI-specific -- impact critical AI assets across distributed infrastructures used to develop and deploy these agents. This methodology allows security teams to: (1) perform comprehensive analysis that communicates effectively across technical domains, (2) quantify security assumptions about third-party AI components without requiring visibility into their implementation, and (3) holistically identify AI-based vulnerabilities relevant to their specific product context. This approach is particularly relevant for securing agentic systems with complex autonomous capabilities. By focusing on assets rather than attacks, our approach scales with the rapidly evolving threat landscape while accommodating increasingly complex and distributed AI development pipelines.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has significantly enhanced their real-world applications. However, achieving consistent performance across languages, especially when integrating cultural knowledge, remains a significant challenge. To better assess this issue, we introduce two new benchmarks: KnowRecall and VisRecall, which evaluate cross-lingual consistency in MLLMs. KnowRecall is a visual question answering benchmark designed to measure factual knowledge consistency in 15 languages, focusing on cultural and historical questions about global landmarks. VisRecall assesses visual memory consistency by asking models to describe landmark appearances in 9 languages without access to images. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, still struggle to achieve cross-lingual consistency. This underscores the need for more robust approaches that produce truly multilingual and culturally aware models.

arXiv:2505.20697v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of hypothesis generation promises to reduce costs in neuroscience by narrowing the range of interventional studies needed to study various phenomena. Existing machine learning methods can generate scientific hypotheses from complex datasets, but many approaches assume causal relationships are static over time, limiting their applicability to systems with dynamic, state-dependent behavior, such as the brain. While some techniques attempt dynamic causal discovery through factor models, they often restrict relationships to linear patterns or impose other simplifying assumptions. We propose a novel method that models dynamic graphs as a conditionally weighted superposition of static graphs, where each static graph can capture nonlinear relationships. This approach enables the detection of complex, time-varying interactions between variables beyond linear limitations. Our method improves f1-scores of predicted dynamic causal patterns by roughly 22-28% on average over baselines in some of our experiments, with some improvements reaching well over 60%. A case study on real brain data demonstrates our method's ability to uncover relationships linked to specific behavioral states, offering valuable insights into neural dynamics.

Abstract: This study presents an innovative approach to urban mobility simulation by integrating a Large Language Model (LLM) with Agent-Based Modeling (ABM). Unlike traditional rule-based ABM, the proposed framework leverages LLM to enhance agent diversity and realism by generating synthetic population profiles, allocating routine and occasional locations, and simulating personalized routes. Using real-world data, the simulation models individual behaviors and large-scale mobility patterns in Taipei City. Key insights, such as route heat maps and mode-specific indicators, provide urban planners with actionable information for policy-making. Future work focuses on establishing robust validation frameworks to ensure accuracy and reliability in urban planning applications.

Abstract: Low-altitude economy (LAE) represents an emerging economic paradigm that redefines commercial and social aerial activities. Large artificial intelligence models (LAIMs) offer transformative potential to further enhance the intelligence of LAE services. However, deploying LAIMs in LAE poses several challenges, including the significant gap between their computational/storage demands and the limited onboard resources of LAE entities, the mismatch between lab-trained LAIMs and dynamic physical environments, and the inefficiencies of traditional decoupled designs for sensing, communication, and computation. To address these issues, we first propose a hierarchical system architecture tailored for LAIM deployment and present representative LAE application scenarios. Next, we explore key enabling techniques that facilitate the mutual co-evolution of LAIMs and low-altitude systems, and introduce a task-oriented execution pipeline for scalable and adaptive service delivery. Then, the proposed framework is validated through real-world case studies. Finally, we outline open challenges to inspire future research.

<title>Gradient-Based Model Fingerprinting for LLM Similarity Detection and Family Classification</title>

arXiv:2506.01631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral software components in modern applications, unauthorized model derivations through fine-tuning, merging, and redistribution have emerged as critical software engineering challenges. Unlike traditional software where clone detection and license compliance are well-established, the LLM ecosystem lacks effective mechanisms to detect model lineage and enforce licensing agreements. This gap is particularly problematic when open-source model creators, such as Meta's LLaMA, require derivative works to maintain naming conventions for attribution, yet no technical means exist to verify compliance.
  To fill this gap, treating LLMs as software artifacts requiring provenance tracking, we present TensorGuard, a gradient-based fingerprinting framework for LLM similarity detection and family classification. Our approach extracts model-intrinsic behavioral signatures by analyzing gradient responses to random input perturbations across tensor layers, operating independently of training data, watermarks, or specific model formats. TensorGuard supports the widely-adopted safetensors format and constructs high-dimensional fingerprints through statistical analysis of gradient features. These fingerprints enable two complementary capabilities: direct pairwise similarity assessment between arbitrary models through distance computation, and systematic family classification of unknown models via the K-Means clustering algorithm with domain-informed centroid initialization using known base models. Experimental evaluation on 58 models comprising 8 base models and 50 derivatives across five model families (Llama, Qwen, Gemma, Phi, Mistral) demonstrates 94% classification accuracy under our centroid-initialized K-Means clustering.

Abstract: While several feature embedding models have been developed in the literature, comparisons of these embeddings have largely focused on their numerical performance in classification-related downstream applications. However, an interpretable comparison of different embeddings requires identifying and analyzing mismatches between sample groups clustered within the embedding spaces. In this work, we propose the \emph{Spectral Pairwise Embedding Comparison (SPEC)} framework to compare embeddings and identify their differences in clustering a reference dataset. Our approach examines the kernel matrices derived from two embeddings and leverages the eigendecomposition of the difference kernel matrix to detect sample clusters that are captured differently by the two embeddings. We present a scalable implementation of this kernel-based approach, with computational complexity that grows linearly with the sample size. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization problem using this framework to align two embeddings, ensuring that clusters identified in one embedding are also captured in the other model. We provide numerical results demonstrating the SPEC's application to compare and align embeddings on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet and MS-COCO.

Abstract: Generative AI technologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), are rapidly being adopted across industry, academia, and government sectors, owing to their remarkable capabilities in natural language processing. However, despite their strengths, the inconsistency and unpredictability of LLM outputs present substantial challenges, especially in security-critical domains such as access control. One critical issue that emerges prominently is the consistency of LLM-generated responses, which is paramount for ensuring secure and reliable operations.
  In this paper, we study the application of LLMs within the context of Cybersecurity Access Control Systems. Specifically, we investigate the consistency and accuracy of LLM-generated password policies, translating natural language prompts into executable pwquality.conf configuration files. Our experimental methodology adopts two distinct approaches: firstly, we utilize pre-trained LLMs to generate configuration files purely from natural language prompts without additional guidance. Secondly, we provide these models with official pwquality.conf documentation to serve as an informative baseline. We systematically assess the soundness, accuracy, and consistency of these AI-generated configurations. Our findings underscore significant challenges in the current generation of LLMs and contribute valuable insights into refining the deployment of LLMs in Access Control Systems.

Abstract: Image restoration aims to recover degraded images. However, existing diffusion-based restoration methods, despite great success in natural image restoration, often struggle to faithfully reconstruct textual regions in degraded images. Those methods frequently generate plausible but incorrect text-like patterns, a phenomenon we refer to as text-image hallucination. In this paper, we introduce Text-Aware Image Restoration (TAIR), a novel restoration task that requires the simultaneous recovery of visual contents and textual fidelity. To tackle this task, we present SA-Text, a large-scale benchmark of 100K high-quality scene images densely annotated with diverse and complex text instances. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task diffusion framework, called TeReDiff, that integrates internal features from diffusion models into a text-spotting module, enabling both components to benefit from joint training. This allows for the extraction of rich text representations, which are utilized as prompts in subsequent denoising steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art restoration methods, achieving significant gains in text recognition accuracy.

Abstract: The recent development and wider accessibility of LLMs have spurred discussions about how they can be used in survey research, including classifying open-ended survey responses. Due to their linguistic capacities, it is possible that LLMs are an efficient alternative to time-consuming manual coding and the pre-training of supervised machine learning models. As most existing research on this topic has focused on English-language responses relating to non-complex topics or on single LLMs, it is unclear whether its findings generalize and how the quality of these classifications compares to established methods. In this study, we investigate to what extent different LLMs can be used to code open-ended survey responses in other contexts, using German data on reasons for survey participation as an example. We compare several state-of-the-art LLMs and several prompting approaches, and evaluate the LLMs' performance by using human expert codings. Overall performance differs greatly between LLMs, and only a fine-tuned LLM achieves satisfactory levels of predictive performance. Performance differences between prompting approaches are conditional on the LLM used. Finally, LLMs' unequal classification performance across different categories of reasons for survey participation results in different categorical distributions when not using fine-tuning. We discuss the implications of these findings, both for methodological research on coding open-ended responses and for their substantive analysis, and for practitioners processing or substantively analyzing such data. Finally, we highlight the many trade-offs researchers need to consider when choosing automated methods for open-ended response classification in the age of LLMs. In doing so, our study contributes to the growing body of research about the conditions under which LLMs can be efficiently, accurately, and reliably leveraged in survey research.

Abstract: Over the past decade, policymakers have developed a set of regulatory tools to ensure AI development aligns with key societal goals. Many of these tools were initially developed in response to concerns with predictive AI and therefore encode certain assumptions about the nature of AI systems and the utility of certain regulatory approaches. With the advent of generative AI, however, some of these assumptions no longer hold, even as policymakers attempt to maintain a single regulatory target that covers both types of AI. In this paper, we identify four distinct aspects of generative AI that call for meaningfully different policy responses. These are the generality and adaptability of generative AI that make it a poor regulatory target, the difficulty of designing effective evaluations, new legal concerns that change the ecosystem of stakeholders and sources of expertise, and the distributed structure of the generative AI value chain. In light of these distinctions, policymakers will need to evaluate where the past decade of policy work remains relevant and where new policies, designed to address the unique risks posed by generative AI, are necessary. We outline three recommendations for policymakers to more effectively identify regulatory targets and leverage constraints across the broader ecosystem to govern generative AI.

<title>Aligning Frozen LLMs by Reinforcement Learning: An Iterative Reweight-then-Optimize Approach</title>

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences usually requires fine-tuning methods such as RLHF and DPO. These methods directly optimize the model parameters, so they cannot be used in test-time to improve model performance, nor are they applicable when the model weights are not accessible. In contrast, test-time methods sidestep weight updates by leveraging reward functions to guide and improve output quality. However, they incur high inference costs, and their one-shot guidance is often based on imperfect reward or value functions, leading to suboptimal outputs. In this work, we present a method named Iterative Reweight-then-Optimize (IRO), a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that performs RL-style alignment of the (frozen) base model without touching its parameters. During training, each iteration (i) samples candidates from the base model, (ii) resamples using current value functions, and (iii) trains a new lightweight value function that guides the next decoding pass. At test time, the value functions are used to guide the base model generation via a search-based optimization process. Notably, users can apply IRO to align a model on their own dataset, similar to OpenAI's reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), but without requiring access to the model weights.

<title>Semantic Structure-Aware Generative Attacks for Enhanced Adversarial Transferability</title>

Abstract: Generative adversarial attacks train a perturbation generator on a white-box surrogate model and subsequently apply the crafted perturbations to unseen black-box victim models. In contrast to iterative attacks, these methods deliver superior inference-time efficiency, scalability, and transferability; however, up until now, existing studies have not fully exploited the representational capacity of generative models to preserve and harness semantic information. Specifically, the intermediate activations of the generator encode rich semantic features--object boundaries and coarse shapes--that remain under-exploited, thereby limiting the alignment of perturbations with object-salient regions which are critical for adversarial transferability. To remedy this, we introduce a semantic structure-aware attack framework based on the Mean Teacher, which serves as a temporally smoothed feature reference. With this smoothed reference, we further direct semantic consistency between the early-layer activations in the student and those of the semantically rich teacher by feature distillation. By anchoring perturbation synthesis to the semantically salient early intermediate blocks within the generator based on empirical findings, our method guides progressive adversarial perturbation on regions that substantially enhance adversarial transferability. We conduct extensive experiments over diverse models, domains and tasks to demonstrate consistent improvements relative to state-of-the-art generative attacks, comprehensively evaluated using conventional metrics and our newly proposed Accidental Correction Rate (ACR).

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show promise for embodied planning tasks but struggle with complex scenarios involving unfamiliar environments and multi-step goals. Current approaches rely on environment-agnostic imitation learning that disconnects instructions from environmental contexts, causing models to struggle with context-sensitive instructions and rely on supplementary cues rather than visual reasoning during long-horizon interactions. In this work, we propose World-Aware Planning Narrative Enhancement (WAP), a framework that infuses LVLMs with comprehensive environmental understanding through four cognitive capabilities (visual appearance modeling, spatial reasoning, functional abstraction, and syntactic grounding) while developing and evaluating models using only raw visual observations through curriculum learning. Evaluations on the EB-ALFRED benchmark demonstrate substantial improvements, with Qwen2.5-VL achieving a 60.7 absolute improvement in task success rates, particularly in commonsense reasoning (+60.0) and long-horizon planning (+70.0). Notably, our enhanced open-source models outperform proprietary systems like GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet by a large margin.

Abstract: Earlier this year, Apple ignited controversy by publishing "The Illusion of Thinking," prompting heated debate within the AI community. Critics seized upon the findings as conclusive evidence that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) lack genuine reasoning capabilities, branding them as mere stochastic parrots. Meanwhile, defenders-spearheaded by Lawsen et al. (2025)-fired back, condemning the experimental setup as flawed and the conclusions overstated. We clarify this debate by replicating and refining two of the original study's most contentious benchmarks: Towers of Hanoi and River Crossing. By introducing incremental stepwise prompting and agentic collaborative dialogue, we show that previously reported failures solving the Towers of Hanoi were not purely result of output constraints, but also partly a result of cognition limitations: LRMs still stumble when complexity rises moderately (around 8 disks). Moreover, the River Crossing results initially heralded as catastrophic failures turn out to hinge upon testing unsolvable configurations. Once we limit tests strictly to solvable problems-LRMs effortlessly solve large instances involving over 100 agent pairs. Our findings ultimately defy simplistic narratives: today's LRMs are stochastic, RL-tuned searchers in a discrete state space we barely understand. Real progress in symbolic, long-horizon reasoning demands mapping that terrain through fine-grained ablations like those introduced here.

<div> Keywords: large language models, dementia diagnosis, explainable AI, neuro-symbolic AI, clinical practice

Summary: 
The review discusses the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in making practical contributions to clinical settings, specifically in dementia diagnosis and care. Standalone machine-learning models excel at pattern recognition but lack interpretable guidance, leading to a lack of trust among clinicians. The use of LLMs alongside physicians did not improve diagnostic accuracy or speed. To address these limitations, hybrid approaches integrating statistical learning with expert rule-based knowledge and involving clinicians can improve interpretability and workflow fit. Future decision-support systems should prioritize explanatory coherence by linking predictions to clinically meaningful causes. Explainable AI and neuro-symbolic AI are proposed as the next steps in AI advancement, focusing on human-computer interactions and patient outcomes rather than just accuracy. It is crucial for AI systems to become more understandable and beneficial in clinical practice.

Abstract: The recent boom of large language models (LLMs) has re-ignited the hope that artificial intelligence (AI) systems could aid medical diagnosis. Yet despite dazzling benchmark scores, LLM assistants have yet to deliver measurable improvements at the bedside. This scoping review aims to highlight the areas where AI is limited to make practical contributions in the clinical setting, specifically in dementia diagnosis and care.
  Standalone machine-learning models excel at pattern recognition but seldom provide actionable, interpretable guidance, eroding clinician trust. Adjacent use of LLMs by physicians did not result in better diagnostic accuracy or speed. Key limitations trace to the data-driven paradigm: black-box outputs which lack transparency, vulnerability to hallucinations, and weak causal reasoning. Hybrid approaches that combine statistical learning with expert rule-based knowledge, and involve clinicians throughout the process help bring back interpretability. They also fit better with existing clinical workflows, as seen in examples like PEIRS and ATHENA-CDS.
  Future decision-support should prioritise explanatory coherence by linking predictions to clinically meaningful causes. This can be done through neuro-symbolic or hybrid AI that combines the language ability of LLMs with human causal expertise. AI researchers have addressed this direction, with explainable AI and neuro-symbolic AI being the next logical steps in further advancement in AI. However, they are still based on data-driven knowledge integration instead of human-in-the-loop approaches. Future research should measure success not only by accuracy but by improvements in clinician understanding, workflow fit, and patient outcomes. A better understanding of what helps improve human-computer interactions is greatly needed for AI systems to become part of clinical practice.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as one of the most significant technological advancements in artificial intelligence in recent years. Their ability to understand, generate, and reason with natural language has transformed how we interact with AI systems. With the development of LLM-based agents and reinforcement-learning-based reasoning models, the study of applying reinforcement learning in agent frameworks has become a new research focus. However, all previous studies face the challenge of deciding the tool calling process and the reasoning process simultaneously, and the chain of reasoning was solely relied on the unprocessed raw result with redundant information and symbols unrelated to the task from the tool, which impose a heavy burden on the model's capability to reason. Therefore, in our research, we proposed a hierarchical framework Agent-as-tool that detach the tool calling process and the reasoning process, which enables the model to focus on the verbally reasoning process while the tool calling process is handled by another agent. Our work had achieved comparable results with only a slight reinforcement fine-tuning on 180 samples, and had achieved exceptionally well performance in Bamboogle with 63.2% of exact match and 75.2% in cover exact match, exceeding Search-R1 by 4.8% in exact match and 3.2% in cover exact match.

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) is an efficient method for describing the dynamic development of facts along a timeline. Most research on TKG reasoning (TKGR) focuses on modelling the repetition of global facts and designing patterns of local historical facts. However, they face two significant challenges: inadequate modeling of the event distribution shift between training and test samples, and reliance on random entity substitution for generating negative samples, which often results in low-quality sampling. To this end, we propose a novel distributional feature modeling approach for training TKGR models, Test-Time Training-guided Distribution shift Modelling (T3DM), to adjust the model based on distribution shift and ensure the global consistency of model reasoning. In addition, we design a negative-sampling strategy to generate higher-quality negative quadruples based on adversarial training. Extensive experiments show that T3DM provides better and more robust results than the state-of-the-art baselines in most cases.

Summary: This paper explores using in-store customers as delivery couriers in a centralized crowd-shipping system to improve last-mile delivery in urban areas. A Markov Decision Process model is proposed to manage uncertainties like order arrival and acceptance probabilities. The integration of NeurADP for order assignment and DDQN for dynamic pricing improves cost efficiency by up to 6.7% compared to fixed pricing NeurADP and 18% over myopic baselines.

Abstract: This paper examines the use of in-store customers as delivery couriers in a centralized crowd-shipping system, targeting the growing need for efficient last-mile delivery in urban areas. We consider a brick-and-mortar retail setting where shoppers are offered compensation to deliver time-sensitive online orders. To manage this process, we propose a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model that captures key uncertainties, including the stochastic arrival of orders and crowd-shippers, and the probabilistic acceptance of delivery offers. Our solution approach integrates Neural Approximate Dynamic Programming (NeurADP) for adaptive order-to-shopper assignment with a Deep Double Q-Network (DDQN) for dynamic pricing. This joint optimization strategy enables multi-drop routing and accounts for offer acceptance uncertainty, aligning more closely with real-world operations. Experimental results demonstrate that the integrated NeurADP + DDQN policy achieves notable improvements in delivery cost efficiency, with up to 6.7\% savings over NeurADP with fixed pricing and approximately 18\% over myopic baselines. We also show that allowing flexible delivery delays and enabling multi-destination routing further reduces operational costs by 8\% and 17\%, respectively. These findings underscore the advantages of dynamic, forward-looking policies in crowd-shipping systems and offer practical guidance for urban logistics operators.

<div> answer set programming, non-monotonic logic, semantics, Gelfond answer set principles, computational complexity

Summary: 
The article discusses the foundations of answer set programming (ASP) and the various semantics proposed for non-monotonic logic programming. It questions the necessity of certain conditions like the minimal model property and foundedness for answer set semantics. The Gelfond answer set principles are refined, introducing well-supportedness, minimality w.r.t. negation, and minimality w.r.t. epistemic negation. New answer set semantics based on these principles are defined. The notion of well-supportedness is extended to answer sets and world views, ensuring constructibility without circular justification. The refined principles are used to assess existing answer set semantics intuitively. Computational complexity is also analyzed. This work provides a critical examination of answer set semantics and offers a new perspective on constructing answer sets. <div>
arXiv:2507.01833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-monotonic logic programming is the basis for a declarative problem solving paradigm known as answer set programming (ASP). Departing from the seminal definition by Gelfond and Lifschitz in 1988 for simple normal logic programs, various answer set semantics have been proposed for extensions. We consider two important questions: (1) Should the minimal model property, constraint monotonicity and foundedness as defined in the literature be mandatory conditions for an answer set semantics in general? (2) If not, what other properties could be considered as general principles for answer set semantics? We address the two questions. First, it seems that the three aforementioned conditions may sometimes be too strong, and we illustrate with examples that enforcing them may exclude expected answer sets. Second, we evolve the Gelfond answer set (GAS) principles for answer set construction by refining the Gelfond's rationality principle to well-supportedness, minimality w.r.t. negation by default and minimality w.r.t. epistemic negation. The principle of well-supportedness guarantees that every answer set is constructible from if-then rules obeying a level mapping and is thus free of circular justification, while the two minimality principles ensure that the formalism minimizes knowledge both at the level of answer sets and of world views. Third, to embody the refined GAS principles, we extend the notion of well-supportedness substantially to answer sets and world views, respectively. Fourth, we define new answer set semantics in terms of the refined GAS principles. Fifth, we use the refined GAS principles as an alternative baseline to intuitively assess the existing answer set semantics. Finally, we analyze the computational complexity.

Summary: 
The study discusses security threats in smart homes related to vulnerabilities at the network layer, device level, and from cloud-based and AI-driven systems. Post-quantum encryption and AI-driven anomaly detection are effective in enhancing security, but face challenges due to computational resource demands. Blockchain authentication and zero-trust structures improve security resilience but require changes to existing infrastructure. Specific security strategies show effectiveness through ANOVA, Chi-square tests, and Monte Carlo simulations, yet lack scalability.

Abstract: Smart homes that integrate Internet of Things (IoT) devices face increasing cybersecurity risks, posing significant challenges to these environments. The study explores security threats in smart homes ecosystems, categorizing them into vulnerabilities at the network layer, device level, and those from cloud-based and AI-driven systems. Research findings indicate that post-quantum encryption, coupled with AI-driven anomaly detection, is highly effective in enhancing security; however, computational resource demands present significant challenges. Blockchain authentication together with zero-trust structures builds security resilience, although they need changes to existing infrastructure. The specific security strategies show their effectiveness through ANOVA, Chi-square tests, and Monte Carlo simulations yet lack sufficient scalability according to the results. The research demonstrates the requirement for improvement in cryptographic techniques, alongside AI-enhanced threat detection and adaptive security models which must achieve a balance between performance and efficiency and real-time applicability within smart home ecosystems.

<div> Keywords: generative artificial intelligence, multimodal large language models, pathology, visual reasoning, CoT

Summary:
PathCoT introduces a new approach to pathology visual reasoning tasks using multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The method addresses key challenges faced by existing models by integrating pathology expert knowledge to guide the reasoning process and prevent model hallucinations. By incorporating domain-specific information, PathCoT allows MLLMs to perform more like pathology experts, improving accuracy in visual analysis. The approach also includes a self-evaluation step to mitigate errors that may arise during reasoning, ensuring a reliable answer is obtained. Experimental results on the PathMMU dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of PathCoT in enhancing pathology visual understanding and reasoning. By combining expert knowledge, MLLMs, and a self-evaluation mechanism, PathCoT provides a comprehensive solution for improving visual reasoning in pathology tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.01029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the development of generative artificial intelligence and instruction tuning techniques, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made impressive progress on general reasoning tasks. Benefiting from the chain-of-thought (CoT) methodology, MLLMs can solve the visual reasoning problem step-by-step. However, existing MLLMs still face significant challenges when applied to pathology visual reasoning tasks: (1) LLMs often underperforms because they lack domain-specific information, which can lead to model hallucinations. (2) The additional reasoning steps in CoT may introduce errors, leading to the divergence of answers. To address these limitations, we propose PathCoT, a novel zero-shot CoT prompting method which integrates the pathology expert-knowledge into the reasoning process of MLLMs and incorporates self-evaluation to mitigate divergence of answers. Specifically, PathCoT guides the MLLM with prior knowledge to perform as pathology experts, and provides comprehensive analysis of the image with their domain-specific knowledge. By incorporating the experts' knowledge, PathCoT can obtain the answers with CoT reasoning. Furthermore, PathCoT incorporates a self-evaluation step that assesses both the results generated directly by MLLMs and those derived through CoT, finally determining the reliable answer. The experimental results on the PathMMU dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on pathology visual understanding and reasoning.

Summary: 

- The study introduces an uncertainty-aware, multi-view dynamic decision framework for omics data classification to enhance accuracy while minimizing testing costs.
- Activation functions of neural networks are refined to generate Dirichlet distribution parameters, capturing belief masses and uncertainty masses for classification results.
- Fusion strategy based on Dempster-Shafer theory integrates heterogeneous omics modalities to improve diagnostic accuracy and robustness.
- A dynamic decision mechanism incrementally introduces omics data for each patient based on model confidence and a predefined threshold.
- Evaluation on four benchmark datasets shows over 50% accurate classification using a single omics modality, reducing redundant testing while maintaining comparable diagnostic performance. Essential biological insights are preserved through this approach. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.01032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background and Objective: High-throughput multi-omics technologies have proven invaluable for elucidating disease mechanisms and enabling early diagnosis. However, the high cost of multi-omics profiling imposes a significant economic burden, with over reliance on full omics data potentially leading to unnecessary resource consumption. To address these issues, we propose an uncertainty-aware, multi-view dynamic decision framework for omics data classification that aims to achieve high diagnostic accuracy while minimizing testing costs. Methodology: At the single-omics level, we refine the activation functions of neural networks to generate Dirichlet distribution parameters, utilizing subjective logic to quantify both the belief masses and uncertainty mass of classification results. Belief mass reflects the support of a specific omics modality for a disease class, while the uncertainty parameter captures limitations in data quality and model discriminability, providing a more trustworthy basis for decision-making. At the multi omics level, we employ a fusion strategy based on Dempster-Shafer theory to integrate heterogeneous modalities, leveraging their complementarity to boost diagnostic accuracy and robustness. A dynamic decision mechanism is then applied that omics data are incrementally introduced for each patient until either all data sources are utilized or the model confidence exceeds a predefined threshold, potentially before all data sources are utilized. Results and Conclusion: We evaluate our approach on four benchmark multi-omics datasets, ROSMAP, LGG, BRCA, and KIPAN. In three datasets, over 50% of cases achieved accurate classification using a single omics modality, effectively reducing redundant testing. Meanwhile, our method maintains diagnostic performance comparable to full-omics models and preserves essential biological insights.

Abstract: Accurate electricity forecasting is crucial for grid stability and energy planning, especially in Benghazi, Libya, where frequent load shedding, generation deficits, and infrastructure limitations persist. This study proposes a data-driven approach to forecast electricity load, generation, and deficits for 2025 using historical data from 2019 (a year marked by instability) and 2023 (a more stable year). Multiple time series models were applied, including ARIMA, seasonal ARIMA, dynamic regression ARIMA, exponential smoothing, extreme gradient boosting, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The dataset was enhanced through missing value imputation, outlier smoothing, and log transformation. Performance was assessed using mean squared error, root mean squared error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error. LSTM outperformed all other models, showing strong capabilities in modeling non-stationary and seasonal patterns. A key contribution of this work is an optimized LSTM framework that integrates exogenous factors such as temperature and humidity, offering robust performance in forecasting multiple electricity indicators. These results provide practical insights for policymakers and grid operators to enable proactive load management and resource planning in data-scarce, volatile regions.

Abstract: The incessant advent of online services demands high speed and efficient recommender systems (ReS) that can maintain real-time performance along with processing very complex user-item interactions. The present study, therefore, considers computational bottlenecks involved in hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN) and Large Language Model (LLM)-based ReS with the aim optimizing their inference latency and training efficiency. An extensive methodology was used: hybrid GNN-LLM integrated architecture-optimization strategies(quantization, LoRA, distillation)-hardware acceleration (FPGA, DeepSpeed)-all under R 4.4.2. Experimental improvements were significant, with the optimal Hybrid + FPGA + DeepSpeed configuration reaching 13.6% more accuracy (NDCG@10: 0.75) at 40-60ms of latency, while LoRA brought down training time by 66% (3.8 hours) in comparison to the non-optimized baseline. Irrespective of domain, such as accuracy or efficiency, it can be established that hardware-software co-design and parameter-efficient tuning permit hybrid models to outperform GNN or LLM approaches implemented independently. It recommends the use of FPGA as well as LoRA for real-time deployment. Future work should involve federated learning along with advanced fusion architectures for better scalability and privacy preservation. Thus, this research marks the fundamental groundwork concerning next-generation ReS balancing low-latency response with cutting-edge personalization.

Summary:
This paper introduces a theory of systemic undecidability, viewing incomputability as a fundamental property of systems rather than specific functions or problems. It defines causal embedding and establishes a closure principle: any subsystem involved in the computation of an undecidable system also becomes undecidable. This highlights undecidability as a pervasive constraint on prediction, modeling, and understanding in both natural and artificial systems. The framework challenges the idea that computational limits can be bypassed through architectural innovation and negates oracle mimicry. By extending classical results to dynamic systems, it enriches the logical lineage of Godel, Turing, and Chaitin, presenting a fresh perspective on the computability topology and its connection to the frontiers of scientific knowledge.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This paper presents a theory of systemic undecidability, reframing incomputability as a structural property of systems rather than a localized feature of specific functions or problems. We define a notion of causal embedding and prove a closure principle: any subsystem that participates functionally in the computation of an undecidable system inherits its undecidability. This result positions undecidability as a pervasive constraint on prediction, modeling, and epistemic access in both natural and artificial systems. Our framework disarms oracle mimicry and challenges the view that computational limits can be circumvented through architectural innovation. By generalizing classical results into a dynamic systems context, this work augments the logical trajectory of G\"odel, Turing, and Chaitin, offering a new perspective of the topology of computability and its interrelation to the boundaries of scientific knowledge.

Summary:<br />
The study focuses on enhancing iterative solvers for Vehicle Routing Problems by introducing the First-Segment-Then-Aggregate (FSTA) decomposition technique. This technique aims to reduce redundant computations by identifying and preserving stable solution segments during the search process. To address the challenge of identifying segments for aggregation, a novel neural framework, Learning-to-Segment (L2Seg), is introduced. L2Seg offers three variants, including non-autoregressive and autoregressive models, which work synergistically to improve solver performance. Experimental results on VRP instances demonstrate that L2Seg accelerates state-of-the-art solvers by up to 7 times. The synergistic approach of combining the NAR and AR variants shows the best performance and highlights the flexibility of L2Seg in improving traditional, learning-based, and hybrid solvers for a variety of VRPs. <div>
arXiv:2507.01037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Iterative search heuristics are widely recognized as state-of-the-art for solving Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). In this work, we identify and exploit a critical observation: within these solvers, a large portion of the solution remains stable, i.e., unchanged across search iterations, causing redundant computations, especially for large-scale VRPs with long subtours. To address this, we pioneer the formal study of the First-Segment-Then-Aggregate (FSTA) decomposition technique to accelerate iterative solvers. Specifically, FSTA preserves stable solution segments during the search, aggregates nodes within each segment into fixed hypernodes, and focuses the search only on unstable portions. Yet, a key challenge lies in identifying which segments should be aggregated by FSTA. To this end, we then introduce Learning-to-Segment (L2Seg), a novel neural framework to intelligently differentiate potentially stable and unstable portions for FSTA decomposition. We present three L2Seg variants: non-autoregressive (globally comprehensive but locally indiscriminate), autoregressive (locally refined but globally deficient), and their synergy, with bespoke training and inference strategies. Empirical results on CVRP and VRPTW suggest that L2Seg accelerates state-of-the-art iterative solvers by up to 7x. Additionally, we provide in-depth analysis showing NAR and AR synergy achieves best performance by combining their complementary strengths. Notably, L2Seg is a flexible framework that is compatible with traditional, learning-based, and hybrid solvers, while supporting a broad class of VRPs.

Abstract: We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach for training neuro-fuzzy controllers using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Building on prior work that applied Deep Q-Learning to Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS), our method replaces the off-policy value-based framework with a stable on-policy actor-critic loop. We evaluate this approach in the CartPole-v1 environment using multiple random seeds and compare its learning performance against ANFIS-Deep Q-Network (DQN) baselines. It was found that PPO-trained fuzzy agents achieved a mean return of 500 +/- 0 on CartPole-v1 after 20000 updates, showcasing less variance than prior DQN-based methods during training and overall faster convergence. These findings suggest that PPO offers a promising pathway for training explainable neuro-fuzzy controllers in reinforcement learning tasks.

Summary:<br />
The paper discusses split learning (SL) as an efficient approach for training artificial intelligence (AI) models. It proposes a DAG-based model splitting algorithm to solve the optimal model splitting problem, which is shown to be optimal through theoretical analysis. Additionally, a block-wise model splitting algorithm is introduced to reduce computational complexity in AI models with block structures. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can quickly determine the optimal model splitting and reduce training delay significantly in dynamic edge networks compared to existing benchmarks. <div>
arXiv:2507.01041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Split learning (SL) has emerged as a computationally efficient approach for artificial intelligence (AI) model training, which can alleviate device-side computational workloads. However, complex AI model architectures pose high computational complexity to obtain the optimal model splitting. In this paper, we represent an arbitrary AI model as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and then reformulate the optimal model splitting problem as a minimum s-t cut search problem. To solve the problem, we propose a fast DAG-based model splitting algorithm, which restructures the DAG to enable the optimal model splitting identification via a maximum flow method. Theoretical analysis indicates that the proposed algorithm is optimal. Furthermore, considering AI models with block structures, we propose a block-wise model splitting algorithm to reduce computational complexity. The algorithm abstracts each block, i.e., a component consisting of multiple layers, into a single vertex, thereby obtaining the optimal model splitting via a simplified DAG. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can determine the optimal model splitting within milliseconds, as well as reduce training delay by 24.62%-38.95% in dynamic edge networks as compared to the state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Abstract: The issue of data-driven neural network model construction is one of the core problems in the domain of Artificial Intelligence. A standard approach assumes a fixed architecture with trainable weights. A conceptually more advanced assumption is that we not only train the weights, but also find out the optimal model architecture. We present a new method that realizes just that. This article is an extended version of our conference paper titled "Dynamic Growing and Shrinking of Neural Networks with Monte Carlo Tree Search [26]". In the paper, we show in detail how to create a neural network with a procedure that allows dynamic shrinking and growing of the model while it is being trained. The decision-making mechanism for the architectural design is governed by a Monte Carlo tree search procedure which simulates network behavior and allows to compare several candidate architecture changes to choose the best one. The proposed method was validated using both visual and time series datasets, demonstrating its particular effectiveness in multivariate time series classification. This is attributed to the architecture's ability to adapt dynamically, allowing independent modifications for each time series. The approach is supplemented by Python source code for reproducibility. Experimental evaluations in visual pattern and multivariate time series classification tasks revealed highly promising performance, underscoring the method's robustness and adaptability.

Abstract: Cardiac biosignals, such as electrocardiograms (ECG) and photoplethysmograms (PPG), are of paramount importance for the diagnosis, prevention, and management of cardiovascular diseases, and have been extensively used in a variety of clinical tasks. Conventional deep learning approaches for analyzing these signals typically rely on homogeneous datasets and static bespoke models, limiting their robustness and generalizability across diverse clinical settings and acquisition protocols. In this study, we present a cardiac sensing foundation model (CSFM) that leverages advanced transformer architectures and a generative, masked pretraining strategy to learn unified representations from vast, heterogeneous health records. Our model is pretrained on an innovative multi-modal integration of data from multiple large-scale datasets (including MIMIC-III-WDB, MIMIC-IV-ECG, and CODE), comprising cardiac signals and the corresponding clinical or machine-generated text reports from approximately 1.7 million individuals. We demonstrate that the embeddings derived from our CSFM not only serve as effective feature extractors across diverse cardiac sensing scenarios, but also enable seamless transfer learning across varying input configurations and sensor modalities. Extensive evaluations across diagnostic tasks, demographic information recognition, vital sign measurement, clinical outcome prediction, and ECG question answering reveal that CSFM consistently outperforms traditional one-modal-one-task approaches. Notably, CSFM exhibits robust performance across multiple ECG lead configurations from standard 12-lead systems to single-lead setups, and in scenarios where only ECG, only PPG, or a combination thereof is available. These findings highlight the potential of CSFM as a versatile and scalable solution, for comprehensive cardiac monitoring.

<div> Keywords: detoxification, social media, semantic preservation, data efficiency, toxic content

Summary:
Detoxification methods for social media content are crucial to combat the spread of toxic materials while preserving original meaning. Current approaches often struggle with balancing detoxification effectiveness, semantic preservation, and handling out-of-distribution data. They also rely on expensive manual annotations and lack data efficiency. To tackle these challenges, a two-stage training framework is proposed. It involves supervised fine-tuning on high-quality data followed by leveraging toxic inputs and a custom reward model for training a Language Model (LLM) using Group Relative Policy Optimization. The method outperforms existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results with improved generalization and reduced reliance on annotated data.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The widespread dissemination of toxic content on social media poses a serious threat to both online environments and public discourse, highlighting the urgent need for detoxification methods that effectively remove toxicity while preserving the original semantics. However, existing approaches often struggle to simultaneously achieve strong detoxification performance, semantic preservation, and robustness to out-of-distribution data. Moreover, they typically rely on costly, manually annotated parallel corpora while showing poor data efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage training framework that jointly optimizes for data efficiency, semantic preservation, and model generalization. We first perform supervised fine-tuning on a small set of high-quality, filtered parallel data to establish a strong initialization. Then, we leverage unlabeled toxic inputs and a custom-designed reward model to train the LLM using Group Relative Policy Optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates the trade-offs faced by previous work, achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved generalization and significantly reduced dependence on annotated data.

<div> consent, AI systems, ethical frameworks, legal implications, data protection
Summary:
The chapter discusses the challenges arising from the evolution of AI systems in relation to traditional legal and ethical frameworks centered around consent. It highlights the inadequacy of the conventional notion of consent in addressing the implications of AI-generated content derived from personal data. The article identifies three key challenges – the scope problem, the temporality problem, and the autonomy trap, collectively leading to a ''consent gap'' in AI systems. It argues that individuals cannot effectively consent to the multitude of potential outputs of their data or the extent of their use. The current legal frameworks fail to address these emerging challenges concerning individual autonomy, identity rights, and social responsibility, especially when AI-generated content creates new forms of personal representation beyond the original consent. The article underscores the need to evolve ethical and legal approaches to consent in light of broader principles of responsible AI, including fairness, transparency, accountability, and autonomy.

Abstract: The evolution of generative AI systems exposes the challenges of traditional legal and ethical frameworks built around consent. This chapter examines how the conventional notion of consent, while fundamental to data protection and privacy rights, proves insufficient in addressing the implications of AI-generated content derived from personal data. Through legal and ethical analysis, we show that while individuals can consent to the initial use of their data for AI training, they cannot meaningfully consent to the numerous potential outputs their data might enable or the extent to which the output is used or distributed. We identify three fundamental challenges: the scope problem, the temporality problem, and the autonomy trap, which collectively create what we term a ''consent gap'' in AI systems and their surrounding ecosystem. We argue that current legal frameworks inadequately address these emerging challenges, particularly regarding individual autonomy, identity rights, and social responsibility, especially in cases where AI-generated content creates new forms of personal representation beyond the scope of the original consent. By examining how these consent limitations intersect with broader principles of responsible AI (including fairness, transparency, accountability, and autonomy) we demonstrate the need to evolve ethical and legal approaches to consent.

Summary:
The study introduces a novel energy functional for long-sequence memory using dense Hopfield networks with higher-order interactions to achieve exponential storage capacity. A temporal kernel $K(m, k)$ is proposed to incorporate temporal dependencies, facilitating efficient sequential retrieval of patterns over extended sequences. The technique is applied successfully for storing and retrieving movie frames due to the high-dimensional vectors in each frame creating sufficient variation for sequential frames. The model enhances transformer architectures by enabling efficient long-sequence modeling, memory augmentation, improved attention with temporal bias, and better handling of long-term dependencies in time-series data. It offers a promising solution for the limitations of transformers in long-context tasks, with potential applications in natural language processing, forecasting, and other domains.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In this study we introduce a novel energy functional for long-sequence memory, building upon the framework of dense Hopfield networks which achieves exponential storage capacity through higher-order interactions. Building upon earlier work on long-sequence Hopfield memory models, we propose a temporal kernal $K(m, k)$ to incorporate temporal dependencies, enabling efficient sequential retrieval of patterns over extended sequences. We demonstrate the successful application of this technique for the storage and sequential retrieval of movies frames which are well suited for this because of the high dimensional vectors that make up each frame creating enough variation between even sequential frames in the high dimensional space. The technique has applications in modern transformer architectures, including efficient long-sequence modeling, memory augmentation, improved attention with temporal bias, and enhanced handling of long-term dependencies in time-series data. Our model offers a promising approach to address the limitations of transformers in long-context tasks, with potential implications for natural language processing, forecasting, and beyond.

<br />
Summary:<br />
The article discusses the potential of leveraging large clinical datasets, particularly MIMIC-IV, for medical research. M3, a tool introduced in the study, aims to simplify the process of querying and understanding MIMIC-IV data. By utilizing natural language queries and the Model Context Protocol, researchers can interact with the database in a user-friendly manner. M3 translates clinical questions into SQL queries, enabling quick retrieval of structured results for nuanced cohort analyses. This approach significantly reduces the technical barriers associated with querying complex healthcare datasets and accelerates the translation of raw records into actionable insights. By democratizing access to MIMIC-IV data, M3 invites a broader research community to explore critical-care information and facilitate research in the healthcare domain.

Abstract: As ever-larger clinical datasets become available, they have the potential to unlock unprecedented opportunities for medical research. Foremost among them is Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV), the world's largest open-source EHR database. However, the inherent complexity of these datasets, particularly the need for sophisticated querying skills and the need to understand the underlying clinical settings, often presents a significant barrier to their effective use. M3 lowers the technical barrier to understanding and querying MIMIC-IV data. With a single command it retrieves MIMIC-IV from PhysioNet, launches a local SQLite instance (or hooks into the hosted BigQuery), and-via the Model Context Protocol (MCP)-lets researchers converse with the database in plain English. Ask a clinical question in natural language; M3 uses a language model to translate it into SQL, executes the query against the MIMIC-IV dataset, and returns structured results alongside the underlying query for verifiability and reproducibility. Demonstrations show that minutes of dialogue with M3 yield the kind of nuanced cohort analyses that once demanded hours of handcrafted SQL and relied on understanding the complexities of clinical workflows. By simplifying access, M3 invites the broader research community to mine clinical critical-care data and accelerates the translation of raw records into actionable insight.

Abstract: Recent advances in materials discovery have been driven by structure-based models, particularly those using crystal graphs. While effective for computational datasets, these models are impractical for real-world applications where atomic structures are often unknown or difficult to obtain. We propose a scalable multimodal framework that learns directly from elemental composition and X-ray diffraction (XRD) -- two of the more available modalities in experimental workflows without requiring crystal structure input. Our architecture integrates modality-specific encoders with a cross-attention fusion module and is trained on the 5-million-sample Alexandria dataset. We present masked XRD modeling (MXM), and apply MXM and contrastive alignment as self-supervised pretraining strategies. Pretraining yields faster convergence (up to 4.2x speedup) and improves both accuracy and representation quality. We further demonstrate that multimodal performance scales more favorably with dataset size than unimodal baselines, with gains compounding at larger data regimes. Our results establish a path toward structure-free, experimentally grounded foundation models for materials science.

Abstract: Deep learning offers transformative potential in medical imaging, yet its clinical adoption is frequently hampered by challenges such as data scarcity, distribution shifts, and the need for robust task generalization. Prompt-based methodologies have emerged as a pivotal strategy to guide deep learning models, providing flexible, domain-specific adaptations that significantly enhance model performance and adaptability without extensive retraining. This systematic review critically examines the burgeoning landscape of prompt engineering in medical imaging. We dissect diverse prompt modalities, including textual instructions, visual prompts, and learnable embeddings, and analyze their integration for core tasks such as image generation, segmentation, and classification. Our synthesis reveals how these mechanisms improve task-specific outcomes by enhancing accuracy, robustness, and data efficiency and reducing reliance on manual feature engineering while fostering greater model interpretability by making the model's guidance explicit. Despite substantial advancements, we identify persistent challenges, particularly in prompt design optimization, data heterogeneity, and ensuring scalability for clinical deployment. Finally, this review outlines promising future trajectories, including advanced multimodal prompting and robust clinical integration, underscoring the critical role of prompt-driven AI in accelerating the revolution of diagnostics and personalized treatment planning in medicine.

Abstract: The judiciary, as one of democracy's three pillars, is dealing with a rising amount of legal issues, needing careful use of judicial resources. This research presents a complex framework that leverages Data Science methodologies, notably Large Language Models (LLM) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, to improve the efficiency of analyzing Calcutta High Court verdicts. Our framework focuses on two key aspects: first, the creation of a robust summarization mechanism that distills complex legal texts into concise and coherent summaries; and second, the development of an intelligent system for retrieving similar cases, which will assist legal professionals in research and decision making. By fine-tuning the Pegasus model using case head note summaries, we achieve significant improvements in the summarization of legal cases. Our two-step summarizing technique preserves crucial legal contexts, allowing for the production of a comprehensive vector database for RAG. The RAG-powered framework efficiently retrieves similar cases in response to user queries, offering thorough overviews and summaries. This technique not only improves legal research efficiency, but it also helps legal professionals and students easily acquire and grasp key legal information, benefiting the overall legal scenario.

Summary:
Collaborative driving involving multiple agents can enhance traffic safety and efficiency but faces challenges related to communication efficiency, information completeness, and agent interoperability. Existing communication methods like raw sensor data and neural network features have limitations. This paper argues for a shift towards using natural language for explicit intent and reasoning communication. Natural language offers a balance between semantic density and communication bandwidth, adapts to real-time conditions, and bridges the gap between different agent platforms. By enabling direct communication of intentions, rationales, and decisions, natural language communication can transform collaborative driving from reactive perception-data sharing to proactive coordination. This transition can enhance safety, efficiency, and transparency in intelligent transportation systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Multi-agent collaborative driving promises improvements in traffic safety and efficiency through collective perception and decision making. However, existing communication media -- including raw sensor data, neural network features, and perception results -- suffer limitations in bandwidth efficiency, information completeness, and agent interoperability. Moreover, traditional approaches have largely ignored decision-level fusion, neglecting critical dimensions of collaborative driving. In this paper we argue that addressing these challenges requires a transition from purely perception-oriented data exchanges to explicit intent and reasoning communication using natural language. Natural language balances semantic density and communication bandwidth, adapts flexibly to real-time conditions, and bridges heterogeneous agent platforms. By enabling the direct communication of intentions, rationales, and decisions, it transforms collaborative driving from reactive perception-data sharing into proactive coordination, advancing safety, efficiency, and transparency in intelligent transportation systems.

Summary:
The paper examines student perceptions of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) use in higher education through a systematic literature review and simulation-based modeling. Nineteen empirical articles were reviewed, with six providing enough quantitative data for probabilistic modeling. Usability and real-world usefulness were found to be key predictors of positive learning achievements, surpassing affective or trust-based factors. A composite "Success Score" was generated through simulation to forecast the relationship between student perceptions and learning outcomes. The study highlights the importance of interdisciplinary perspectives in understanding the impact of GenAI tools in educational settings, addressing longstanding debates on their integration within universities. <div>

Abstract: The exponential development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies like ChatGPT has raised increasing curiosity about their use in higher education, specifically with respect to how students view them, make use of them, and the implications for learning outcomes. This paper employs a hybrid methodological approach involving a systematic literature review and simulation-based modeling to explore student perceptions of GenAI use in the context of higher education. A total of nineteen empirical articles from 2023 through 2025 were selected from the PRISMA-based search targeting the Scopus database. Synthesis of emerging patterns from the literature was achieved by thematic categorization. Six of these had enough quantitative information, i.e., item-level means and standard deviations, to permit probabilistic modeling. One dataset, from the resulting subset, was itself selected as a representative case with which to illustrate inverse-variance weighting by Monte Carlo simulation, by virtue of its well-designed Likert scale format and thematic alignment with the use of computing systems by the researcher.
  The simulation provided a composite "Success Score" forecasting the strength of the relationship between student perceptions and learning achievements. Findings reveal that attitude factors concerned with usability and real-world usefulness are significantly better predictors of positive learning achievement than affective or trust-based factors. Such an interdisciplinary perspective provides a unique means of linking thematic results with predictive modelling, resonating with longstanding controversies about the proper use of GenAI tools within the university.

Summary:<br /><br />Online dating platforms have revolutionized how romantic relationships are formed, with algorithmic matching systems playing a crucial role. However, current recommendation systems in dating apps suffer from various algorithmic deficiencies, such as popularity bias and inadequate models for reciprocity. This research provides a comprehensive analysis of these systems, identifying key issues and proposing research-backed solutions. By evaluating reciprocal recommendation frameworks and fairness metrics, the study shows that current systems have modest performance, with collaborative filtering reaching 25.1% accuracy and reciprocal methods achieving 28.7%. To address these limitations, a mathematical framework is proposed, incorporating enhanced similarity measures, multi-objective optimization, and fairness-aware algorithms. These enhancements aim to maintain competitive accuracy while reducing demographic biases in recommendation systems. <div>

Abstract: Online dating platforms have fundamentally transformed the formation of romantic relationships, with millions of users worldwide relying on algorithmic matching systems to find compatible partners. However, current recommendation systems in dating applications suffer from significant algorithmic deficiencies, including but not limited to popularity bias, filter bubble effects, and inadequate reciprocity modeling that limit effectiveness and introduce harmful biases. This research integrates foundational work with recent empirical findings to deliver a detailed analysis of dating app recommendation systems, highlighting key issues and suggesting research-backed solutions. Through analysis of reciprocal recommendation frameworks, fairness evaluation metrics, and industry implementations, we demonstrate that current systems achieve modest performance with collaborative filtering reaching 25.1\% while reciprocal methods achieve 28.7\%. Our proposed mathematical framework addresses these limitations through enhanced similarity measures, multi-objective optimization, and fairness-aware algorithms that maintain competitive accuracy while improving demographic representation to reduce algorithmic bias.

Summary: 
This paper explores the use of a state-of-the-art foundational model for forecasting rare, sporadic production outages in high-performance machine learning services. The study compares the forecasting errors of the foundational model with classical stochastic models like moving average and autoregressive models. The analysis highlights the performance of each model for predicting sporadic or spiky events and identifies key patterns in the data that are well captured by the foundational model. By optimizing the models with optimal parameters, the study achieves less than 6% value errors in estimating a year-long outage statistics for a specific root cause. Overall, the paper demonstrates the capability of foundational models in forecasting rare events and provides insights into their effectiveness compared to traditional stochastic forecasting models.

Abstract: Time series forecasting models have diverse real world applications (e.g., from electricity metrics to software workload). Latest foundational models trained for time series forecasting show strengths (e.g., for long sequences and in zero-shot settings). However, foundational model was not yet used for forecasting rare, spiky events, i.e., a challenging target because those are a corner case of extreme events. In this paper, we optimize a state-of-the-art foundational model to forecast sporadic or spiky production outages of high-performance machine learning services powering billions of client devices. We evaluate the forecasting errors of the foundational model compared with classical stochastic forecasting models (e.g., moving average and autoregressive). The analysis helps us understand how each of the evaluated models performs for the sporadic or spiky events. For example, it identifies the key patterns in the target data that are well tracked by the foundational model vs. each of the stochastic models. We use the models with optimal parameters to estimate a year-long outage statistics of a particular root cause with less than 6% value errors.

The paper evaluates three algorithms for the NP-complete mutual-visibility (MV) problem: a greedy heuristic, a hypergraph-based approximation, and a genetic algorithm. The algorithms are tested on synthetic graph datasets, including graphs with known $\mu(G)$ values. For smaller graphs, the algorithms align with theoretical bounds, but for larger instances, solution sizes deviate from limits, making quality assessment challenging. Despite the lack of tight bounds, the Genetic Algorithm and other heuristics perform best on known optimal graphs. The study fills a gap in empirical analysis of the MV problem, highlighting the discrepancies between theoretical and practical behavior of the algorithms. <div>

Abstract: The NP-complete mutual-visibility (MV) problem currently lacks empirical analysis on its practical behaviour despite theoretical studies. This paper addresses this gap by implementing and evaluating three distinct algorithms - a direct greedy heuristic, a hypergraph-based approximation, and a genetic algorithm - on diverse synthetic graph datasets, including those with analytically known $\mu(G)$ values and general graph models. Our results demonstrate that for smaller graphs, the algorithms consistently achieve MV set sizes aligning with theoretical bounds. However, for larger instances, achieved solution sizes notably diverge from theoretical limits; this, combined with the absence of tight bounds, complicates absolute quality assessment. Nevertheless, validation on known optimal graphs showed the Genetic Algorithm and other heuristics empirically performing best among tested methods.

<div> Keywords: trauma, digital treatments, AI guidance, pupillometry, intrusive memories

Summary:
AI and neurotechnology may offer a scalable alternative to human guides in delivering digital treatments for trauma, as demonstrated by the ANTIDOTE system. A study involving 100 participants showed that the AI-guided Imagery Competing Task Intervention (ICTI) effectively reduced intrusive memories after exposure to traumatic stimuli. The intervention group reported fewer intrusive memories compared to the control group, indicating the success of the AI guidance. Pupillometry was used to track engagement with the intervention, with pupil size predicting symptom reduction and potentially serving as a biomarker of intervention effectiveness. These findings suggest that AI-guided digital interventions have the potential to be effective in addressing trauma on a broader scale, offering personalized and scalable solutions for individuals in need.

Abstract: Trauma prevalence is vast globally. Evidence-based digital treatments can help, but most require human guidance. Human guides provide tailored instructions and responsiveness to internal cognitive states, but limit scalability. Can generative AI and neurotechnology provide a scalable alternative? Here we test ANTIDOTE, combining AI guidance and pupillometry to automatically deliver and monitor an evidence-based digital treatment, specifically the Imagery Competing Task Intervention (ICTI), to reduce intrusive memories after psychological trauma. One hundred healthy volunteers were exposed to videos of traumatic events and randomly assigned to an intervention or active control condition. As predicted, intervention participants reported significantly fewer intrusive memories over the following week. Post-hoc assessment against clinical rubrics confirmed the AI guide delivered the intervention successfully. Additionally, pupil size tracked intervention engagement and predicted symptom reduction, providing a candidate biomarker of intervention effectiveness. These findings open a path toward rigorous AI-guided digital interventions that can scale to trauma prevalence.

Summary:<br /><br />Researchers propose a 4D video generation model aiming to improve the generation of dynamic scenes with temporal coherence and geometric consistency across multiple camera views. The model utilizes cross-view pointmap alignment as geometric supervision during training to learn a shared 3D representation of the scene. This approach allows the model to predict future video sequences from new viewpoints without needing camera poses as inputs. The method outperforms existing baselines by producing visually stable and spatially aligned predictions on various robotic datasets. Additionally, the predicted 4D videos enable the recovery of robot end-effector trajectories using a standard 6DoF pose tracker, supporting robust robot manipulation and generalization to novel camera viewpoints.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting the dynamics of the physical world can enhance a robot's ability to plan and interact effectively in complex environments. While recent video generation models have shown strong potential in modeling dynamic scenes, generating videos that are both temporally coherent and geometrically consistent across camera views remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose a 4D video generation model that enforces multi-view 3D consistency of videos by supervising the model with cross-view pointmap alignment during training. This geometric supervision enables the model to learn a shared 3D representation of the scene, allowing it to predict future video sequences from novel viewpoints based solely on the given RGB-D observations, without requiring camera poses as inputs. Compared to existing baselines, our method produces more visually stable and spatially aligned predictions across multiple simulated and real-world robotic datasets. We further show that the predicted 4D videos can be used to recover robot end-effector trajectories using an off-the-shelf 6DoF pose tracker, supporting robust robot manipulation and generalization to novel camera viewpoints.

Summary:
Foundation Models are widely successful in AI but their effectiveness in modeling brainwaves is unclear. Large Brainwave Foundation Models (LBMs) were evaluated through fine-tuning experiments on BCI tasks, showing marginal improvements over traditional models with significantly more parameters. Ablation studies and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) reduced parameters without performance loss, highlighting inefficiencies in LBMs. Training strategies for BCI applications were explored through model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient techniques. LoRA applied to LBMs showed performance benefits when adapting multiple neural network components simultaneously. Domain-specific development strategies are needed to enhance LBMs, suggesting possible redesign of current architectures for better utilization in brainwave analysis. These findings emphasize the importance of optimizing LBMs for BCI applications.

Abstract: Foundation Models have demonstrated significant success across various domains in Artificial Intelligence (AI), yet their capabilities for brainwave modeling remain unclear. In this paper, we comprehensively evaluate current Large Brainwave Foundation Models (LBMs) through systematic fine-tuning experiments across multiple Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) benchmark tasks, including memory tasks and sleep stage classification. Our extensive analysis shows that state-of-the-art LBMs achieve only marginal improvements (0.9%-1.2%) over traditional deep architectures while requiring significantly more parameters (millions vs thousands), raising important questions about their efficiency and applicability in BCI contexts. Moreover, through detailed ablation studies and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we significantly reduce trainable parameters without performance degradation, while demonstrating that architectural and training inefficiencies limit LBMs' current capabilities. Our experiments span both full model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient adaptation techniques, providing insights into optimal training strategies for BCI applications. We pioneer the application of LoRA to LBMs, revealing that performance benefits generally emerge when adapting multiple neural network components simultaneously. These findings highlight the critical need for domain-specific development strategies to advance LBMs, suggesting that current architectures may require redesign to fully leverage the potential of foundation models in brainwave analysis.

Summary:
This work introduces a novel motion planning algorithm for robotic manipulators by integrating sampling-based and search-based planning techniques. The key innovation lies in the utilization of adaptive motion primitives called burs of free configuration space (C-space) within the graph search algorithm. Burs have the ability to dynamically expand in free C-space, facilitating more efficient exploration of the configuration space compared to fixed-sized motion primitives. The algorithm is implemented in the SMPL library and tested across various scenarios with manipulators of different degrees-of-freedom (DoF) and environmental complexities. Results indicate that the bur-based approach surpasses fixed-primitive planning in intricate scenarios, particularly for high DoF manipulators, while delivering comparable performance in simpler scenarios. This research contributes to enhancing motion planning efficiency and effectiveness for robotic manipulators, offering promising prospects for real-world applications.

Abstract: This work proposes a motion planning algorithm for robotic manipulators that combines sampling-based and search-based planning methods. The core contribution of the proposed approach is the usage of burs of free configuration space (C-space) as adaptive motion primitives within the graph search algorithm. Due to their feature to adaptively expand in free C-space, burs enable more efficient exploration of the configuration space compared to fixed-sized motion primitives, significantly reducing the time to find a valid path and the number of required expansions. The algorithm is implemented within the existing SMPL (Search-Based Motion Planning Library) library and evaluated through a series of different scenarios involving manipulators with varying number of degrees-of-freedom (DoF) and environment complexity. Results demonstrate that the bur-based approach outperforms fixed-primitive planning in complex scenarios, particularly for high DoF manipulators, while achieving comparable performance in simpler scenarios.

Abstract: Organizations around the world schedule jobs (programs) regularly to perform various tasks dictated by their end users. With the major movement towards using a cloud computing infrastructure, our organization follows a hybrid approach with both cloud and on-prem servers. The objective of this work is to perform capacity planning, i.e., estimate resource requirements, and job scheduling for on-prem grid computing environments. A key contribution of our approach is handling uncertainty in both resource usage and duration of the jobs, a critical aspect in the finance industry where stochastic market conditions significantly influence job characteristics. For capacity planning and scheduling, we simultaneously balance two conflicting objectives: (a) minimize resource usage, and (b) provide high quality-of-service to the end users by completing jobs by their requested deadlines. We propose approximate approaches using deterministic estimators and pair sampling-based constraint programming. Our best approach (pair sampling-based) achieves much lower peak resource usage compared to manual scheduling without compromising on the quality-of-service.

Abstract: Stochastic gradient-based descent (SGD), have long been central to training large language models (LLMs). However, their effectiveness is increasingly being questioned, particularly in large-scale applications where empirical evidence suggests potential performance limitations. In response, this paper proposes a stochastic conjugate subgradient method together with adaptive sampling tailored specifically for training LLMs. The method not only achieves faster convergence per iteration but also demonstrates improved scalability compared to traditional SGD techniques. It leverages sample complexity analysis to adaptively choose the sample size, employs a stochastic conjugate subgradient approach to determine search directions and utilizing an AdamW-like algorithm to adaptively adjust step sizes. This approach preserves the key advantages of first-order methods while effectively addressing the nonconvexity and non-smoothness inherent in LLMs training. Additionally, we provide a detailed analysis of the advantage of the algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed method not only maintains, but in many cases surpasses, the scalability of traditional SGD techniques, significantly enhancing both the speed and accuracy of the optimization process.

Abstract: Designing diverse and safety-critical driving scenarios is essential for evaluating autonomous driving systems. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for few-shot code generation to automatically synthesize driving scenarios within the CARLA simulator, which has flexibility in scenario scripting, efficient code-based control of traffic participants, and enforcement of realistic physical dynamics. Given a few example prompts and code samples, the LLM generates safety-critical scenario scripts that specify the behavior and placement of traffic participants, with a particular focus on collision events. To bridge the gap between simulation and real-world appearance, we integrate a video generation pipeline using Cosmos-Transfer1 with ControlNet, which converts rendered scenes into realistic driving videos. Our approach enables controllable scenario generation and facilitates the creation of rare but critical edge cases, such as pedestrian crossings under occlusion or sudden vehicle cut-ins. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating a wide range of realistic, diverse, and safety-critical scenarios, offering a promising tool for simulation-based testing of autonomous vehicles.

Summary: <br />
In the study, a new evaluation framework for unlearning in large multimodal models (LMMs) is introduced, focusing on realistic scenarios. The PULSE protocol considers unlearning pre-trained knowledge and evaluates long-term sustainability through sequential requests. Existing unlearning methods are assessed across these dimensions, revealing challenges in eliminating pre-training knowledge and maintaining performance when unlearning sequential data. While some techniques are successful in unlearning fine-tuned knowledge, they struggle with pre-training information. Additionally, methods effective in batch unlearning show performance degradation when data are split and unlearned sequentially. This study highlights the need for improved unlearning techniques in LMMs to address privacy and copyright concerns effectively. <br /> <div>

Abstract: In recent years, unlearning techniques, which are methods for inducing a model to "forget" previously learned information, have attracted attention as a way to address privacy and copyright concerns in large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs). While several unlearning benchmarks have been established for LLMs, a practical evaluation framework for unlearning in LMMs has been less explored. Specifically, existing unlearning benchmark for LMMs considers only scenarios in which the model is required to unlearn fine-tuned knowledge through a single unlearning operation. In this study, we introduce PULSE protocol for realistic unlearning scenarios for LMMs by introducing two critical perspectives: (i) Pre-trained knowledge Unlearning for analyzing the effect across different knowledge acquisition phases and (ii) Long-term Sustainability Evaluation to address sequential requests. We then evaluate existing unlearning methods along these dimensions. Our results reveal that, although some techniques can successfully unlearn knowledge acquired through fine-tuning, they struggle to eliminate information learned during pre-training. Moreover, methods that effectively unlearn a batch of target data in a single operation exhibit substantial performance degradation when the same data are split and unlearned sequentially.

Abstract: Traditional simulator-based training for maritime professionals is critical for ensuring safety at sea but often depends on subjective trainer assessments of technical skills, behavioral focus, communication, and body language, posing challenges such as subjectivity, difficulty in measuring key features, and cognitive limitations. Addressing these issues, this study develops an AI-driven framework to enhance maritime training by objectively assessing trainee performance through visual focus tracking, speech recognition, and stress detection, improving readiness for high-risk scenarios. The system integrates AI techniques, including visual focus determination using eye tracking, pupil dilation analysis, and computer vision; communication analysis through a maritime-specific speech-to-text model and natural language processing; communication correctness using large language models; and mental stress detection via vocal pitch. Models were evaluated on data from simulated maritime scenarios with seafarers exposed to controlled high-stress events. The AI algorithms achieved high accuracy, with ~92% for visual detection, ~91% for maritime speech recognition, and ~90% for stress detection, surpassing existing benchmarks. The system provides insights into visual attention, adherence to communication checklists, and stress levels under demanding conditions. This study demonstrates how AI can transform maritime training by delivering objective performance analytics, enabling personalized feedback, and improving preparedness for real-world operational challenges.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by integrating their parametric knowledge with external retrieved content. However, knowledge conflicts caused by internal inconsistencies or noisy retrieved content can severely undermine the generation reliability of RAG systems.In this work, we argue that LLMs should rethink all evidence, including both retrieved content and internal knowledge, before generating responses.We propose CARE-RAG (Conflict-Aware and Reliable Evidence for RAG), a novel framework that improves trustworthiness through Conflict-Driven Summarization of all available evidence.CARE-RAG first derives parameter-aware evidence by comparing parameter records to identify diverse internal perspectives. It then refines retrieved evidences to produce context-aware evidence, removing irrelevant or misleading content. To detect and summarize conflicts, we distill a 3B LLaMA3.2 model to perform conflict-driven summarization, enabling reliable synthesis across multiple sources.To further ensure evaluation integrity, we introduce a QA Repair step to correct outdated or ambiguous benchmark answers.Experiments on revised QA datasets with retrieval data show that CARE-RAG consistently outperforms strong RAG baselines, especially in scenarios with noisy or conflicting evidence.

Abstract: Recent advancements in open-source Visual Language Models (VLMs) such as LLaVA, Qwen-VL, and Llama have catalyzed extensive research on their integration with diverse systems. The internet-scale general knowledge encapsulated within these models presents significant opportunities for enhancing autonomous driving perception, prediction, and planning capabilities. In this paper we propose VLAD, a vision-language autonomous driving model, which integrates a fine-tuned VLM with VAD, a state-of-the-art end-to-end system. We implement a specialized fine-tuning approach using custom question-answer datasets designed specifically to improve the spatial reasoning capabilities of the model. The enhanced VLM generates high-level navigational commands that VAD subsequently processes to guide vehicle operation. Additionally, our system produces interpretable natural language explanations of driving decisions, thereby increasing transparency and trustworthiness of the traditionally black-box end-to-end architecture. Comprehensive evaluation on the real-world nuScenes dataset demonstrates that our integrated system reduces average collision rates by 31.82% compared to baseline methodologies, establishing a new benchmark for VLM-augmented autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Stochastic control problems in high dimensions are notoriously difficult to solve due to the curse of dimensionality. An alternative to traditional dynamic programming is Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP), which recasts the problem as a system of Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (FBSDEs). In this paper, we introduce a formal framework for solving such problems with deep learning by defining a \textbf{Neural Hamiltonian Operator (NHO)}. This operator parameterizes the coupled FBSDE dynamics via neural networks that represent the feedback control and an ansatz for the value function's spatial gradient. We show how the optimal NHO can be found by training the underlying networks to enforce the consistency conditions dictated by the PMP. By adopting this operator-theoretic view, we situate the deep FBSDE method within the rigorous language of statistical inference, framing it as a problem of learning an unknown operator from simulated data. This perspective allows us to prove the universal approximation capabilities of NHOs under general martingale drivers and provides a clear lens for analyzing the significant optimization challenges inherent to this class of models.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has demonstrated remarkable success in large language models (LLMs) due to its adaptability and parameter-free nature. However, it also introduces a critical vulnerability to backdoor attacks, where adversaries can manipulate LLM behaviors by simply poisoning a few ICL demonstrations. In this paper, we propose, for the first time, the dual-learning hypothesis, which posits that LLMs simultaneously learn both the task-relevant latent concepts and backdoor latent concepts within poisoned demonstrations, jointly influencing the probability of model outputs. Through theoretical analysis, we derive an upper bound for ICL backdoor effects, revealing that the vulnerability is dominated by the concept preference ratio between the task and the backdoor. Motivated by these findings, we propose ICLShield, a defense mechanism that dynamically adjusts the concept preference ratio. Our method encourages LLMs to select clean demonstrations during the ICL phase by leveraging confidence and similarity scores, effectively mitigating susceptibility to backdoor attacks. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and tasks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art defense effectiveness, significantly outperforming existing approaches (+26.02% on average). Furthermore, our method exhibits exceptional adaptability and defensive performance even for closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4).

Abstract: Detecting abnormal events in real-world customer service dialogues is highly challenging due to the complexity of business data and the dynamic nature of customer interactions. Moreover, models must demonstrate strong out-of-domain (OOD) generalization to enable rapid adaptation across different business scenarios and maximize commercial value. In this work, we propose a novel Adaptive Perplexity-Aware Reinforcement Learning (APARL) framework that leverages the advanced reasoning capabilities of large language models for abnormal event detection. APARL introduces a dual-loop dynamic curriculum learning architecture, enabling the model to progressively focus on more challenging samples as its proficiency increases. This design effectively addresses performance bottlenecks and significantly enhances OOD transferability. Extensive evaluations on food delivery dialogue tasks show that our model achieves significantly enhanced adaptability and robustness, attaining the highest F1 score with an average improvement of 17.19\%, and an average improvement of 9.59\% in OOD transfer tests. This method provides a superior solution for industrial deployment of anomaly detection models, contributing to improved operational efficiency and commercial benefits.

Abstract: We introduce LEDOM, the first purely reverse language model, trained autoregressively on 435B tokens with 2B and 7B parameter variants, which processes sequences in reverse temporal order through previous token prediction. For the first time, we present the reverse language model as a potential foundational model across general tasks, accompanied by a set of intriguing examples and insights. Based on LEDOM, we further introduce a novel application: Reverse Reward, where LEDOM-guided reranking of forward language model outputs leads to substantial performance improvements on mathematical reasoning tasks. This approach leverages LEDOM's unique backward reasoning capability to refine generation quality through posterior evaluation. Our findings suggest that LEDOM exhibits unique characteristics with broad application potential. We will release all models, training code, and pre-training data to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Music source separation (MSS) aims to extract individual instrument sources from their mixture. While most existing methods focus on the widely adopted four-stem separation setup (vocals, bass, drums, and other instruments), this approach lacks the flexibility needed for real-world applications. To address this, we propose GuideSep, a diffusion-based MSS model capable of instrument-agnostic separation beyond the four-stem setup. GuideSep is conditioned on multiple inputs: a waveform mimicry condition, which can be easily provided by humming or playing the target melody, and mel-spectrogram domain masks, which offer additional guidance for separation. Unlike prior approaches that relied on fixed class labels or sound queries, our conditioning scheme, coupled with the generative approach, provides greater flexibility and applicability. Additionally, we design a mask-prediction baseline using the same model architecture to systematically compare predictive and generative approaches. Our objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that GuideSep achieves high-quality separation while enabling more versatile instrument extraction, highlighting the potential of user participation in the diffusion-based generative process for MSS. Our code and demo page are available at https://yutongwen.github.io/GuideSep/

Abstract: Despite the critical role of reward models (RMs) in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), current state-of-the-art open RMs perform poorly on most existing evaluation benchmarks, failing to capture the spectrum of nuanced and sophisticated human preferences. Even approaches that incorporate advanced training techniques have not yielded meaningful performance improvements. We hypothesize that this brittleness stems primarily from limitations in preference datasets, which are often narrowly scoped, synthetically labeled, or lack rigorous quality control. To address these challenges, we present a large-scale preference dataset comprising 40 million preference pairs, named SynPref-40M. To enable data curation at scale, we design a human-AI synergistic two-stage pipeline that leverages the complementary strengths of human annotation quality and AI scalability. In this pipeline, humans provide verified annotations, while large language models perform automatic curation based on human guidance. Training on this preference mixture, we introduce Skywork-Reward-V2, a suite of eight reward models ranging from 0.6B to 8B parameters, trained on a carefully curated subset of 26 million preference pairs from SynPref-40M. We demonstrate that Skywork-Reward-V2 is versatile across a wide range of capabilities, including alignment with human preferences, objective correctness, safety, resistance to stylistic biases, and best-of-N scaling, achieving state-of-the-art performance across seven major reward model benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm that the effectiveness of our approach stems not only from data scale but also from high-quality curation. The Skywork-Reward-V2 series represents substantial progress in open reward models, highlighting the untapped potential of existing preference datasets and demonstrating how human-AI curation synergy can unlock significantly higher data quality.

Abstract: Intelligent control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) swarms has emerged as a critical research focus, and it typically requires the swarm to navigate effectively while avoiding obstacles and achieving continuous coverage over multiple mission targets. Although traditional Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approaches offer dynamic adaptability, they are hindered by the semantic gap in numerical communication and the rigidity of homogeneous role structures, resulting in poor generalization and limited task scalability. Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM)-based control frameworks demonstrate strong semantic reasoning capabilities by leveraging extensive prior knowledge. However, due to the lack of online learning and over-reliance on static priors, these works often struggle with effective exploration, leading to reduced individual potential and overall system performance. To address these limitations, we propose a Role-Adaptive LLM-Driven Yoked navigation algorithm RALLY. Specifically, we first develop an LLM-driven semantic decision framework that uses structured natural language for efficient semantic communication and collaborative reasoning. Afterward, we introduce a dynamic role-heterogeneity mechanism for adaptive role switching and personalized decision-making. Furthermore, we propose a Role-value Mixing Network (RMIX)-based assignment strategy that integrates LLM offline priors with MARL online policies to enable semi-offline training of role selection strategies. Experiments in the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE) environment and a Software-In-The-Loop (SITL) platform demonstrate that RALLY outperforms conventional approaches in terms of task coverage, convergence speed, and generalization, highlighting its strong potential for collaborative navigation in agentic multi-UAV systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been proven to be highly effective in handling complex control tasks. Traditional methods typically use unimodal distributions, such as Gaussian distributions, to model the output of value distributions. However, unimodal distribution often and easily causes bias in value function estimation, leading to poor algorithm performance. This paper proposes a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm called DSAC-D (Distributed Soft Actor Critic with Diffusion Policy) to address the challenges of estimating bias in value functions and obtaining multimodal policy representations. A multimodal distributional policy iteration framework that can converge to the optimal policy was established by introducing policy entropy and value distribution function. A diffusion value network that can accurately characterize the distribution of multi peaks was constructed by generating a set of reward samples through reverse sampling using a diffusion model. Based on this, a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm with dual diffusion of the value network and the policy network was derived. MuJoCo testing tasks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only learns multimodal policy, but also achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in all 9 control tasks, with significant suppression of estimation bias and total average return improvement of over 10\% compared to existing mainstream algorithms. The results of real vehicle testing show that DSAC-D can accurately characterize the multimodal distribution of different driving styles, and the diffusion policy network can characterize multimodal trajectories.

Abstract: Fetal abdominal malformations are serious congenital anomalies that require accurate diagnosis to guide pregnancy management and reduce mortality. Although AI has demonstrated significant potential in medical diagnosis, its application to prenatal abdominal anomalies remains limited. Most existing studies focus on image-level classification and rely on standard plane localization, placing less emphasis on case-level diagnosis. In this paper, we develop a case-level multiple instance learning (MIL)-based method, free of standard plane localization, for classifying fetal abdominal anomalies in prenatal ultrasound. Our contribution is three-fold. First, we adopt a mixture-of-attention-experts module (MoAE) to weight different attention heads for various planes. Secondly, we propose a medical-knowledge-driven feature selection module (MFS) to align image features with medical knowledge, performing self-supervised image token selection at the case-level. Finally, we propose a prompt-based prototype learning (PPL) to enhance the MFS. Extensively validated on a large prenatal abdominal ultrasound dataset containing 2,419 cases, with a total of 24,748 images and 6 categories, our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors.

Abstract: Grey matter loss in the hippocampus is a hallmark of neurobiological aging, yet understanding the corresponding changes in its functional connectivity remains limited. Seed-based functional connectivity (FC) analysis enables voxel-wise mapping of the hippocampus's synchronous activity with cortical regions, offering a window into functional reorganization during aging. In this study, we develop an interpretable deep learning framework to predict brain age from hippocampal FC using a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D CNN) combined with LayerCAM saliency mapping. This approach maps key hippocampal-cortical connections, particularly with the precuneus, cuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, parahippocampal cortex, left superior parietal lobule, and right superior temporal sulcus, that are highly sensitive to age. Critically, disaggregating anterior and posterior hippocampal FC reveals distinct mapping aligned with their known functional specializations. These findings provide new insights into the functional mechanisms of hippocampal aging and demonstrate the power of explainable deep learning to uncover biologically meaningful patterns in neuroimaging data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities as autonomous agents with rapidly expanding applications in various domains. As these agents increasingly engage in socioeconomic interactions, identifying their potential for undesirable behavior becomes essential. In this work, we examine scenarios where they can choose to collude, defined as secretive cooperation that harms another party. To systematically study this, we investigate the behavior of LLM agents acting as sellers in simulated continuous double auction markets. Through a series of controlled experiments, we analyze how parameters such as the ability to communicate, choice of model, and presence of environmental pressures affect the stability and emergence of seller collusion. We find that direct seller communication increases collusive tendencies, the propensity to collude varies across models, and environmental pressures, such as oversight and urgency from authority figures, influence collusive behavior. Our findings highlight important economic and ethical considerations for the deployment of LLM-based market agents.

<title>Penalizing Transparency? How AI Disclosure and Author Demographics Shape Human and AI Judgments About Writing</title>

Abstract: As AI integrates in various types of human writing, calls for transparency around AI assistance are growing. However, if transparency operates on uneven ground and certain identity groups bear a heavier cost for being honest, then the burden of openness becomes asymmetrical. This study investigates how AI disclosure statement affects perceptions of writing quality, and whether these effects vary by the author's race and gender. Through a large-scale controlled experiment, both human raters (n = 1,970) and LLM raters (n = 2,520) evaluated a single human-written news article while disclosure statements and author demographics were systematically varied. This approach reflects how both human and algorithmic decisions now influence access to opportunities (e.g., hiring, promotion) and social recognition (e.g., content recommendation algorithms). We find that both human and LLM raters consistently penalize disclosed AI use. However, only LLM raters exhibit demographic interaction effects: they favor articles attributed to women or Black authors when no disclosure is present. But these advantages disappear when AI assistance is revealed. These findings illuminate the complex relationships between AI disclosure and author identity, highlighting disparities between machine and human evaluation patterns.

Abstract: Document shadow removal is a crucial task in the field of document image enhancement. However, existing methods tend to remove shadows with constant color background and ignore color shadows. In this paper, we first design a diffusion model in latent space for document image shadow removal, called DocShaDiffusion. It translates shadow images from pixel space to latent space, enabling the model to more easily capture essential features. To address the issue of color shadows, we design a shadow soft-mask generation module (SSGM). It is able to produce accurate shadow mask and add noise into shadow regions specially. Guided by the shadow mask, a shadow mask-aware guided diffusion module (SMGDM) is proposed to remove shadows from document images by supervising the diffusion and denoising process. We also propose a shadow-robust perceptual feature loss to preserve details and structures in document images. Moreover, we develop a large-scale synthetic document color shadow removal dataset (SDCSRD). It simulates the distribution of realistic color shadows and provides powerful supports for the training of models. Experiments on three public datasets validate the proposed method's superiority over state-of-the-art. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.

Abstract: Deep neural networks generate and process large volumes of data, posing challenges for low-resource embedded systems. In-memory computing has been demonstrated as an efficient computing infrastructure and shows promise for embedded AI applications. Among newly-researched memory technologies, racetrack memory is a non-volatile technology that allows high data density fabrication, making it a good fit for in-memory computing. However, integrating in-memory arithmetic circuits with memory cells affects both the memory density and power efficiency. It remains challenging to build efficient in-memory arithmetic circuits on racetrack memory within area and energy constraints. To this end, we present an efficient in-memory convolutional neural network (CNN) accelerator optimized for use with racetrack memory. We design a series of fundamental arithmetic circuits as in-memory computing cells suited for multiply-and-accumulate operations. Moreover, we explore the design space of racetrack memory based systems and CNN model architectures, employing co-design to improve the efficiency and performance of performing CNN inference in racetrack memory while maintaining model accuracy. Our designed circuits and model-system co-optimization strategies achieve a small memory bank area with significant improvements in energy and performance for racetrack memory based embedded systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant attention due to their versatility across a wide array of applications. Fine-tuning LLMs with parameter-efficient adapters, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enables these models to efficiently adapt to downstream tasks without extensive retraining. Deploying fine-tuned LLMs on multi-tenant edge devices offers substantial benefits, such as reduced latency, enhanced privacy, and personalized responses. However, serving LLMs efficiently on resource-constrained edge devices presents critical challenges, including the complexity of adapter selection for different tasks and memory overhead from frequent adapter swapping. Moreover, given the multiple requests in multi-tenant settings, processing requests sequentially results in underutilization of computational resources and increased latency. This paper introduces EdgeLoRA, an efficient system for serving LLMs on edge devices in multi-tenant environments. EdgeLoRA incorporates three key innovations: (1) an adaptive adapter selection mechanism to streamline the adapter configuration process; (2) heterogeneous memory management, leveraging intelligent adapter caching and pooling to mitigate memory operation overhead; and (3) batch LoRA inference, enabling efficient batch processing to significantly reduce computational latency. Comprehensive evaluations using the Llama3.1-8B model demonstrate that EdgeLoRA significantly outperforms the status quo (i.e., llama.cpp) in terms of both latency and throughput. The results demonstrate that EdgeLoRA can achieve up to a 4 times boost in throughput. Even more impressively, it can serve several orders of magnitude more adapters simultaneously. These results highlight EdgeLoRA's potential to transform edge deployment of LLMs in multi-tenant scenarios, offering a scalable and efficient solution for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: RISC-V provides a flexible and scalable platform for applications ranging from embedded devices to high-performance computing clusters. Particularly, its RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV) becomes of interest for the acceleration of AI workloads. But writing software that efficiently utilizes the vector units of RISC-V CPUs without expert knowledge requires the programmer to rely on the autovectorization features of compilers or hand-crafted libraries like muRISCV-NN. Smarter approaches, like autotuning frameworks, have been missing the integration with the RISC-V RVV extension, thus heavily limiting the efficient deployment of complex AI workloads. In this paper, we present a workflow based on the TVM compiler to efficiently map AI workloads onto RISC-V vector units. Instead of relying on hand-crafted libraries, we integrated the RVV extension into TVM's MetaSchedule framework, a probabilistic program framework for tensor operation tuning. We implemented different RISC-V SoCs on an FPGA and tuned a wide range of AI workloads on them. We found that our proposal shows a mean improvement of 46% in execution latency when compared against the autovectorization feature of GCC, and 29% against muRISCV-NN. Moreover, the binary resulting from our proposal has a smaller code memory footprint, making it more suitable for embedded devices. Finally, we also evaluated our solution on a commercially available RISC-V SoC implementing the RVV 1.0 Vector Extension and found our solution is able to find mappings that are 35% faster on average than the ones proposed by LLVM. We open-sourced our proposal for the community to expand it to target other RISC-V extensions.

Abstract: Instance segmentation of novel objects instances in RGB images, given some example images for each object, is a well known problem in computer vision. Designing a model general enough to be employed, for all kinds of novel objects, without (re-) training, has proven to be a difficult task. To handle this, we propose a simple, yet powerful, framework, called: Novel Object Cyclic Threshold based Instance Segmentation (NOCTIS). This work stems from and improves upon previous ones like CNOS, SAM-6D and NIDS-Net; thus, it also leverages on recent vision foundation models, namely: Grounded-SAM 2 and DINOv2. It utilises Grounded-SAM 2 to obtain object proposals with precise bounding boxes and their corresponding segmentation masks; while DINOv2's zero-shot capabilities are employed to generate the image embeddings. The quality of those masks, together with their embeddings, is of vital importance to our approach; as the proposal-object matching is realized by determining an object matching score based on the similarity of the class embeddings and the average maximum similarity of the patch embeddings. Differently to SAM-6D, calculating the latter involves a prior patch filtering based on the distance between each patch and its corresponding cyclic/roundtrip patch in the image grid. Furthermore, the average confidence of the proposals' bounding box and mask is used as an additional weighting factor for the object matching score. We empirically show that NOCTIS, without further training/fine tuning, outperforms the best RGB and RGB-D methods on the seven core datasets of the BOP 2023 challenge for the "Model-based 2D segmentation of unseen objects" task.

Abstract: This work re-examines the commonly held assumption that the frequency of rewards is a reliable measure of task difficulty in reinforcement learning. We identify and formalize a structural challenge that undermines the effectiveness of current policy learning methods: when essential subgoals do not directly yield rewards. We characterize such settings as exhibiting zero-incentive dynamics, where transitions critical to success remain unrewarded. We show that state-of-the-art deep subgoal-based algorithms fail to leverage these dynamics and that learning performance is highly sensitive to the temporal proximity between subgoal completion and eventual reward. These findings reveal a fundamental limitation in current approaches and point to the need for mechanisms that can infer latent task structure without relying on immediate incentives.

<title>Evaluating the Effectiveness of Direct Preference Optimization for Personalizing German Automatic Text Simplifications for Persons with Intellectual Disabilities</title>

Abstract: Automatic text simplification (ATS) aims to enhance language accessibility for various target groups, particularly persons with intellectual disabilities. Recent advancements in generative AI, especially large language models (LLMs), have substantially improved the quality of machine-generated text simplifications, thereby mitigating information barriers for the target group. However, existing LLM-based ATS systems do not incorporate preference feedback on text simplifications during training, resulting in a lack of personalization tailored to the specific needs of target group representatives.
  In this work, we extend the standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approach for adapting LLM-based ATS models by leveraging a computationally efficient LLM alignment technique -- direct preference optimization (DPO). Specifically, we post-train LLM-based ATS models using human feedback collected from persons with intellectual disabilities, reflecting their preferences on paired text simplifications generated by mainstream LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a pipeline for developing personalized LLM-based ATS systems, encompassing data collection, model selection, SFT and DPO post-training, and evaluation. Our findings underscore the necessity of active participation of target group persons in designing personalized AI accessibility solutions aligned with human expectations. This work represents a step towards personalizing inclusive AI systems at the target-group level, incorporating insights not only from text simplification experts but also from target group persons themselves.

Abstract: This paper presents a praxeological analysis of artificial intelligence and algorithmic governance, challenging assumptions about the capacity of machine systems to sustain economic and epistemic order. Drawing on Misesian a priori reasoning and Austrian theories of entrepreneurship, we argue that AI systems are incapable of performing the core functions of economic coordination: interpreting ends, discovering means, and communicating subjective value through prices. Where neoclassical and behavioural models treat decisions as optimisation under constraint, we frame them as purposive actions under uncertainty.
  We critique dominant ethical AI frameworks such as Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAT) as extensions of constructivist rationalism, which conflict with a liberal order grounded in voluntary action and property rights. Attempts to encode moral reasoning in algorithms reflect a misunderstanding of ethics and economics. However complex, AI systems cannot originate norms, interpret institutions, or bear responsibility. They remain opaque, misaligned, and inert.
  Using the concept of epistemic scarcity, we explore how information abundance degrades truth discernment, enabling both entrepreneurial insight and soft totalitarianism. Our analysis ends with a civilisational claim: the debate over AI concerns the future of human autonomy, institutional evolution, and reasoned choice. The Austrian tradition, focused on action, subjectivity, and spontaneous order, offers the only coherent alternative to rising computational social control.

Yet, their application remains constrained by rigid protocol design, limited adaptability to dynamic lab conditions, inadequate error handling, and high operational complexity. Here we introduce BioMARS (Biological Multi-Agent Robotic System), an intelligent platform that integrates LLMs, VLMs, and modular robotics to autonomously design, plan, and execute biological experiments. BioMARS uses a hierarchical architecture: the Biologist Agent synthesizes protocols via retrieval-augmented generation; the Technician Agent translates them into executable robotic pseudo-code; and the Inspector Agent ensures procedural integrity through multimodal perception and anomaly detection. The system autonomously conducts cell passaging and culture tasks, matching or exceeding manual performance in viability, consistency, and morphological integrity. It also supports context-aware optimization, outperforming conventional strategies in differentiating retinal pigment epithelial cells. A web interface enables real-time human-AI collaboration, while a modular backend allows scalable integration with laboratory hardware. These results highlight the feasibility of generalizable, AI-driven laboratory automation and the transformative role of language-based reasoning in biological research.

Abstract: Insect pests continue to bring a serious threat to crop yields around the world, and traditional methods for monitoring them are often slow, manual, and difficult to scale. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful solution, with techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), vision transformers (ViTs), and hybrid models gaining popularity for automating pest detection. This review looks at 37 carefully selected studies published between 2018 and 2025, all focused on AI-based pest classification. The selected research is organized by crop type, pest species, model architecture, dataset usage, and key technical challenges. The early studies relied heavily on CNNs but latest work is shifting toward hybrid and transformer-based models that deliver higher accuracy and better contextual understanding. Still, challenges like imbalanced datasets, difficulty in detecting small pests, limited generalizability, and deployment on edge devices remain significant hurdles. Overall, this review offers a structured overview of the field, highlights useful datasets, and outlines the key challenges and future directions for AI-based pest monitoring systems.

Abstract: Global warming, loss of biodiversity, and air pollution are among the most significant problems facing Earth. One of the primary challenges in addressing these issues is the lack of monitoring forests to protect them. To tackle this problem, it is important to leverage remote sensing and computer vision methods to automate monitoring applications. Hence, automatic tree crown detection algorithms emerged based on traditional and deep learning methods. In this study, we first introduce two different tree crown detection methods based on these approaches. Then, we form a novel rule-based approach that integrates these two methods to enhance robustness and accuracy of tree crown detection results. While traditional methods are employed for feature extraction and segmentation of forested areas, deep learning methods are used to detect tree crowns in our method. With the proposed rule-based approach, we post-process these results, aiming to increase the number of detected tree crowns through neighboring trees and localized operations. We compare the obtained results with the proposed method in terms of the number of detected tree crowns and report the advantages, disadvantages, and areas for improvement of the obtained outcomes.

Abstract: The collection and release of street-level recordings as Open Data play a vital role in advancing autonomous driving systems and AI research. However, these datasets pose significant privacy risks, particularly for pedestrians, due to the presence of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that extends beyond biometric traits such as faces. In this paper, we present cRID, a novel cross-modal framework combining Large Vision-Language Models, Graph Attention Networks, and representation learning to detect textual describable clues of PII and enhance person re-identification (Re-ID). Our approach focuses on identifying and leveraging interpretable features, enabling the detection of semantically meaningful PII beyond low-level appearance cues. We conduct a systematic evaluation of PII presence in person image datasets. Our experiments show improved performance in practical cross-dataset Re-ID scenarios, notably from Market-1501 to CUHK03-np (detected), highlighting the framework's practical utility. Code is available at https://github.com/RAufschlaeger/cRID.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning can play a key role in addressing sustainable energy challenges. For instance, many grid systems are heavily congested, highlighting the urgent need to enhance operational efficiency. However, reinforcement learning approaches have traditionally been slow due to the high sample complexity and expensive simulation requirements. While recent works have effectively used GPUs to accelerate data generation by converting environments to JAX, these works have largely focussed on classical toy problems. This paper introduces Chargax, a JAX-based environment for realistic simulation of electric vehicle charging stations designed for accelerated training of RL agents. We validate our environment in a variety of scenarios based on real data, comparing reinforcement learning agents against baselines. Chargax delivers substantial computational performance improvements of over 100x-1000x over existing environments. Additionally, Chargax' modular architecture enables the representation of diverse real-world charging station configurations.

Abstract: Critical infrastructure, such as transport networks, underpins economic growth by enabling mobility and trade. However, ageing assets, climate change impacts (e.g., extreme weather, rising sea levels), and hybrid threats ranging from natural disasters to cyber attacks and conflicts pose growing risks to their resilience and functionality. This review paper explores how emerging digital technologies, specifically Artificial Intelligence (AI), can enhance damage assessment and monitoring of transport infrastructure. A systematic literature review examines existing AI models and datasets for assessing damage in roads, bridges, and other critical infrastructure impacted by natural disasters. Special focus is given to the unique challenges and opportunities associated with bridge damage detection due to their structural complexity and critical role in connectivity. The integration of SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data with AI models is also discussed, with the review revealing a critical research gap: a scarcity of studies applying AI models to SAR data for comprehensive bridge damage assessment. Therefore, this review aims to identify the research gaps and provide foundations for AI-driven solutions for assessing and monitoring critical transport infrastructures.

Abstract: This paper explores how older adults, particularly aging migrants in urban China, can engage AI-assisted co-creation to express personal narratives that are often fragmented, underrepresented, or difficult to verbalize. Through a pilot workshop combining oral storytelling and the symbolic reconstruction of Hanzi, participants shared memories of migration and recreated new character forms using Xiaozhuan glyphs, suggested by the Large Language Model (LLM), together with physical materials. Supported by human facilitation and a soft AI presence, participants transformed lived experience into visual and tactile expressions without requiring digital literacy. This approach offers new perspectives on human-AI collaboration and aging by repositioning AI not as a content producer but as a supportive mechanism, and by supporting narrative agency within sociotechnical systems.

Abstract: Process Reinforcement Learning~(PRL) has demonstrated considerable potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models~(LLMs). However, introducing additional process reward models incurs substantial computational overhead, and there is no unified theoretical framework for process-level advantage estimation. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{S}elf-Guided \textbf{P}rocess \textbf{R}eward \textbf{O}ptimization~(\textbf{SPRO}), a novel framework that enables process-aware RL through two key innovations: (1) we first theoretically demonstrate that process rewards can be derived intrinsically from the policy model itself, and (2) we introduce well-defined cumulative process rewards and \textbf{M}asked \textbf{S}tep \textbf{A}dvantage (\textbf{MSA}), which facilitates rigorous step-wise action advantage estimation within shared-prompt sampling groups. Our experimental results demonstrate that SPRO outperforms vaniila GRPO with 3.4x higher training efficiency and a 17.5\% test accuracy improvement. Furthermore, SPRO maintains a stable and elevated policy entropy throughout training while reducing the average response length by approximately $1/3$, evidencing sufficient exploration and prevention of reward hacking. Notably, SPRO incurs no additional computational overhead compared to outcome-supervised RL methods such as GRPO, which benefit industrial implementation.

Abstract: We present a full-stack emergency vehicle (EV) siren detection system designed for real-time deployment on embedded hardware. The proposed approach is based on E2PANNs, a fine-tuned convolutional neural network derived from EPANNs, and optimized for binary sound event detection under urban acoustic conditions. A key contribution is the creation of curated and semantically structured datasets - AudioSet-EV, AudioSet-EV Augmented, and Unified-EV - developed using a custom AudioSet-Tools framework to overcome the low reliability of standard AudioSet annotations. The system is deployed on a Raspberry Pi 5 equipped with a high-fidelity DAC+microphone board, implementing a multithreaded inference engine with adaptive frame sizing, probability smoothing, and a decision-state machine to control false positive activations. A remote WebSocket interface provides real-time monitoring and facilitates live demonstration capabilities. Performance is evaluated using both framewise and event-based metrics across multiple configurations. Results show the system achieves low-latency detection with improved robustness under realistic audio conditions. This work demonstrates the feasibility of deploying IoS-compatible SED solutions that can form distributed acoustic monitoring networks, enabling collaborative emergency vehicle tracking across smart city infrastructures through WebSocket connectivity on low-cost edge devices.

Abstract: The creativity of classical music arises not only from composers who craft the musical sheets but also from performers who interpret the static notations with expressive nuances. This paper addresses the challenge of generating classical piano performances from scratch, aiming to emulate the dual roles of composer and pianist in the creative process. We introduce the Expressive Compound Word (ECP) representation, which effectively captures both the metrical structure and expressive nuances of classical performances. Building on this, we propose the Expressive Music Variational AutoEncoder (XMVAE), a model featuring two branches: a Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) branch that generates score-related content, representing the Composer, and a vanilla VAE branch that produces expressive details, fulfilling the role of Pianist. These branches are jointly trained with similar Seq2Seq architectures, leveraging a multiscale encoder to capture beat-level contextual information and an orthogonal Transformer decoder for efficient compound tokens decoding. Both objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that XMVAE generates classical performances with superior musical quality compared to state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, pretraining the Composer branch on extra musical score datasets contribute to a significant performance gain.

<title>Data Agent: A Holistic Architecture for Orchestrating Data+AI Ecosystems</title>

Abstract: Traditional Data+AI systems utilize data-driven techniques to optimize performance, but they rely heavily on human experts to orchestrate system pipelines, enabling them to adapt to changes in data, queries, tasks, and environments. For instance, while there are numerous data science tools available, developing a pipeline planning system to coordinate these tools remains challenging. This difficulty arises because existing Data+AI systems have limited capabilities in semantic understanding, reasoning, and planning. Fortunately, we have witnessed the success of large language models (LLMs) in enhancing semantic understanding, reasoning, and planning abilities. It is crucial to incorporate LLM techniques to revolutionize data systems for orchestrating Data+AI applications effectively.
  To achieve this, we propose the concept of a 'Data Agent' - a comprehensive architecture designed to orchestrate Data+AI ecosystems, which focuses on tackling data-related tasks by integrating knowledge comprehension, reasoning, and planning capabilities. We delve into the challenges involved in designing data agents, such as understanding data/queries/environments/tools, orchestrating pipelines/workflows, optimizing and executing pipelines, and fostering pipeline self-reflection. Furthermore, we present examples of data agent systems, including a data science agent, data analytics agents (such as unstructured data analytics agent, semantic structured data analytics agent, data lake analytics agent, and multi-modal data analytics agent), and a database administrator (DBA) agent. We also outline several open challenges associated with designing data agent systems.

Abstract: The widespread use of deep learning face recognition raises several security concerns. Although prior works point at existing vulnerabilities, DNN backdoor attacks against real-life, unconstrained systems dealing with images captured in the wild remain a blind spot of the literature. This paper conducts the first system-level study of backdoors in deep learning-based face recognition systems. This paper yields four contributions by exploring the feasibility of DNN backdoors on these pipelines in a holistic fashion. We demonstrate for the first time two backdoor attacks on the face detection task: face generation and face landmark shift attacks. We then show that face feature extractors trained with large margin losses also fall victim to backdoor attacks. Combining our models, we then show using 20 possible pipeline configurations and 15 attack cases that a single backdoor enables an attacker to bypass the entire function of a system. Finally, we provide stakeholders with several best practices and countermeasures.

<title>Enhanced Influence-aware Group Recommendation for Online Media Propagation</title>

Abstract: Group recommendation over social media streams has attracted significant attention due to its wide applications in domains such as e-commerce, entertainment, and online news broadcasting. By leveraging social connections and group behaviours, group recommendation (GR) aims to provide more accurate and engaging content to a set of users rather than individuals. Recently, influence-aware GR has emerged as a promising direction, as it considers the impact of social influence on group decision-making. In earlier work, we proposed Influence-aware Group Recommendation (IGR) to solve this task. However, this task remains challenging due to three key factors: the large and ever-growing scale of social graphs, the inherently dynamic nature of influence propagation within user groups, and the high computational overhead of real-time group-item matching.
  To tackle these issues, we propose an Enhanced Influence-aware Group Recommendation (EIGR) framework. First, we introduce a Graph Extraction-based Sampling (GES) strategy to minimise redundancy across multiple temporal social graphs and effectively capture the evolving dynamics of both groups and items. Second, we design a novel DYnamic Independent Cascade (DYIC) model to predict how influence propagates over time across social items and user groups. Finally, we develop a two-level hash-based User Group Index (UG-Index) to efficiently organise user groups and enable real-time recommendation generation. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework, EIGR, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both effectiveness and efficiency.

<title>Prompt Guidance and Human Proximal Perception for HOT Prediction with Regional Joint Loss</title>

Abstract: The task of Human-Object conTact (HOT) detection involves identifying the specific areas of the human body that are touching objects. Nevertheless, current models are restricted to just one type of image, often leading to too much segmentation in areas with little interaction, and struggling to maintain category consistency within specific regions. To tackle this issue, a HOT framework, termed \textbf{P3HOT}, is proposed, which blends \textbf{P}rompt guidance and human \textbf{P}roximal \textbf{P}erception. To begin with, we utilize a semantic-driven prompt mechanism to direct the network's attention towards the relevant regions based on the correlation between image and text. Then a human proximal perception mechanism is employed to dynamically perceive key depth range around the human, using learnable parameters to effectively eliminate regions where interactions are not expected. Calculating depth resolves the uncertainty of the overlap between humans and objects in a 2D perspective, providing a quasi-3D viewpoint. Moreover, a Regional Joint Loss (RJLoss) has been created as a new loss to inhibit abnormal categories in the same area. A new evaluation metric called ``AD-Acc.'' is introduced to address the shortcomings of existing methods in addressing negative samples. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in four metrics across two benchmark datasets. Specifically, our model achieves an improvement of \textbf{0.7}$\uparrow$, \textbf{2.0}$\uparrow$, \textbf{1.6}$\uparrow$, and \textbf{11.0}$\uparrow$ in SC-Acc., mIoU, wIoU, and AD-Acc. metrics, respectively, on the HOT-Annotated dataset. Code is available at https://github.com/YuxiaoWang-AI/P3HOT.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have recently emerged as a paradigm for 3D reconstruction from multiview satellite imagery. However, state-of-the-art NeRF methods are typically constrained to small scenes due to the memory footprint during training, which we study in this paper. Previous work on large-scale NeRFs palliate this by dividing the scene into NeRFs. This paper introduces Snake-NeRF, a framework that scales to large scenes. Our out-of-core method eliminates the need to load all images and networks simultaneously, and operates on a single device. We achieve this by dividing the region of interest into NeRFs that 3D tile without overlap. Importantly, we crop the images with overlap to ensure each NeRFs is trained with all the necessary pixels. We introduce a novel $2\times 2$ 3D tile progression strategy and segmented sampler, which together prevent 3D reconstruction errors along the tile edges. Our experiments conclude that large satellite images can effectively be processed with linear time complexity, on a single GPU, and without compromise in quality.

Abstract: We present Depth Anything at Any Condition (DepthAnything-AC), a foundation monocular depth estimation (MDE) model capable of handling diverse environmental conditions. Previous foundation MDE models achieve impressive performance across general scenes but not perform well in complex open-world environments that involve challenging conditions, such as illumination variations, adverse weather, and sensor-induced distortions. To overcome the challenges of data scarcity and the inability of generating high-quality pseudo-labels from corrupted images, we propose an unsupervised consistency regularization finetuning paradigm that requires only a relatively small amount of unlabeled data. Furthermore, we propose the Spatial Distance Constraint to explicitly enforce the model to learn patch-level relative relationships, resulting in clearer semantic boundaries and more accurate details. Experimental results demonstrate the zero-shot capabilities of DepthAnything-AC across diverse benchmarks, including real-world adverse weather benchmarks, synthetic corruption benchmarks, and general benchmarks.

Abstract: We present an analysis of landscape features for predicting the performance of multi-objective combinatorial optimization algorithms. We consider features from the recently proposed compressed Pareto Local Optimal Solutions Networks (C-PLOS-net) model of combinatorial landscapes. The benchmark instances are a set of rmnk-landscapes with 2 and 3 objectives and various levels of ruggedness and objective correlation. We consider the performance of three algorithms -- Pareto Local Search (PLS), Global Simple EMO Optimizer (GSEMO), and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) - using the resolution and hypervolume metrics. Our tailored analysis reveals feature combinations that influence algorithm performance specific to certain landscapes. This study provides deeper insights into feature importance, tailored to specific rmnk-landscapes and algorithms.

Abstract: Gradients of neural networks encode valuable information for optimization, editing, and analysis of models. Therefore, practitioners often treat gradients as inputs to task-specific algorithms, e.g. for pruning or optimization. Recent works explore learning algorithms that operate directly on gradients but use architectures that are not specifically designed for gradient processing, limiting their applicability. In this paper, we present a principled approach for designing architectures that process gradients. Our approach is guided by three principles: (1) equivariant design that preserves neuron permutation symmetries, (2) processing sets of gradients across multiple data points to capture curvature information, and (3) efficient gradient representation through rank-1 decomposition. Based on these principles, we introduce GradMetaNet, a novel architecture for learning on gradients, constructed from simple equivariant blocks. We prove universality results for GradMetaNet, and show that previous approaches cannot approximate natural gradient-based functions that GradMetaNet can. We then demonstrate GradMetaNet's effectiveness on a diverse set of gradient-based tasks on MLPs and transformers, such as learned optimization, INR editing, and estimating loss landscape curvature.

<title>Autoregressive Image Generation with Linear Complexity: A Spatial-Aware Decay Perspective</title>

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have garnered significant attention in image generation for their ability to effectively capture both local and global structures within visual data. However, prevalent AR models predominantly rely on the transformer architectures, which are beset by quadratic computational complexity concerning input sequence length and substantial memory overhead due to the necessity of maintaining key-value caches. Although linear attention mechanisms have successfully reduced this burden in language models, our initial experiments reveal that they significantly degrade image generation quality because of their inability to capture critical long-range dependencies in visual data. We propose Linear Attention with Spatial-Aware Decay (LASAD), a novel attention mechanism that explicitly preserves genuine 2D spatial relationships within the flattened image sequences by computing position-dependent decay factors based on true 2D spatial location rather than 1D sequence positions. Based on this mechanism, we present LASADGen, an autoregressive image generator that enables selective attention to relevant spatial contexts with linear complexity. Experiments on ImageNet show LASADGen achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance and computational efficiency, bridging the gap between linear attention's efficiency and spatial understanding needed for high-quality generation.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a pivotal technology in the post-training phase of large language models (LLMs). Traditional task-colocated RL frameworks suffer from significant scalability bottlenecks, while task-separated RL frameworks face challenges in complex dataflows and the corresponding resource idling and workload imbalance. Moreover, most existing frameworks are tightly coupled with LLM training or inference engines, making it difficult to support custom-designed engines. To address these challenges, we propose AsyncFlow, an asynchronous streaming RL framework for efficient post-training. Specifically, we introduce a distributed data storage and transfer module that provides a unified data management and fine-grained scheduling capability in a fully streamed manner. This architecture inherently facilitates automated pipeline overlapping among RL tasks and dynamic load balancing. Moreover, we propose a producer-consumer-based asynchronous workflow engineered to minimize computational idleness by strategically deferring parameter update process within staleness thresholds. Finally, the core capability of AsynFlow is architecturally decoupled from underlying training and inference engines and encapsulated by service-oriented user interfaces, offering a modular and customizable user experience. Extensive experiments demonstrate an average of 1.59 throughput improvement compared with state-of-the-art baseline. The presented architecture in this work provides actionable insights for next-generation RL training system designs.

Abstract: The field of numerical optimization has recently seen a surge in the development of "novel" metaheuristic algorithms, inspired by metaphors derived from natural or human-made processes, which have been widely criticized for obscuring meaningful innovations and failing to distinguish themselves from existing approaches. Aiming to address these concerns, we investigate the applicability of statistical tests for comparing algorithms based on their search behavior. We utilize the cross-match statistical test to compare multivariate distributions and assess the solutions produced by 114 algorithms from the MEALPY library. These findings are incorporated into an empirical analysis aiming to identify algorithms with similar search behaviors.

Abstract: Deep Recommender Models (DLRMs) inference is a fundamental AI workload accounting for more than 79% of the total AI workload in Meta's data centers. DLRMs' performance bottleneck is found in the embedding layers, which perform many random memory accesses to retrieve small embedding vectors from tables of various sizes. We propose the design of tailored data flows to speedup embedding look-ups. Namely, we propose four strategies to look up an embedding table effectively on one core, and a framework to automatically map the tables asymmetrically to the multiple cores of a SoC. We assess the effectiveness of our method using the Huawei Ascend AI accelerators, comparing it with the default Ascend compiler, and we perform high-level comparisons with Nvidia A100. Results show a speed-up varying from 1.5x up to 6.5x for real workload distributions, and more than 20x for extremely unbalanced distributions. Furthermore, the method proves to be much more independent of the query distribution than the baseline.

<title>Blending Supervised and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with Prefix Sampling</title>

Abstract: Existing post-training techniques for large language models are broadly categorized into Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT). Each paradigm presents a distinct trade-off: SFT excels at mimicking demonstration data but can lead to problematic generalization as a form of behavior cloning. Conversely, RFT can significantly enhance a model's performance but is prone to learn unexpected behaviors, and its performance is highly sensitive to the initial policy. In this paper, we propose a unified view of these methods and introduce Prefix-RFT, a hybrid approach that synergizes learning from both demonstration and exploration. Using mathematical reasoning problems as a testbed, we empirically demonstrate that Prefix-RFT is both simple and effective. It not only surpasses the performance of standalone SFT and RFT but also outperforms parallel mixed-policy RFT methods. A key advantage is its seamless integration into existing open-source frameworks, requiring only minimal modifications to the standard RFT pipeline. Our analysis highlights the complementary nature of SFT and RFT, and validates that Prefix-RFT effectively harmonizes these two learning paradigms. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm the method's robustness to variations in the quality and quantity of demonstration data. We hope this work offers a new perspective on LLM post-training, suggesting that a unified paradigm that judiciously integrates demonstration and exploration could be a promising direction for future research.

Abstract: While existing auditing techniques attempt to identify potential unwanted behaviours in large language models (LLMs), we address the complementary forensic problem of reconstructing the exact input that led to an existing LLM output - enabling post-incident analysis and potentially the detection of fake output reports. We formalize exact input reconstruction as a discrete optimisation problem with a unique global minimum and introduce SODA, an efficient gradient-based algorithm that operates on a continuous relaxation of the input search space with periodic restarts and parameter decay. Through comprehensive experiments on LLMs ranging in size from 33M to 3B parameters, we demonstrate that SODA significantly outperforms existing approaches. We succeed in fully recovering 79.5% of shorter out-of-distribution inputs from next-token logits, without a single false positive, but struggle to extract private information from the outputs of longer (15+ token) input sequences. This suggests that standard deployment practices may currently provide adequate protection against malicious use of our method. Our code is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15539879.

Abstract: Estimating causal effects from real-world relational data can be challenging when the underlying causal model and potential confounders are unknown. While several causal discovery algorithms exist for learning causal models with latent confounders from data, they assume that the data is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and are not well-suited for learning from relational data. Similarly, existing relational causal discovery algorithms assume causal sufficiency, which is unrealistic for many real-world datasets. To address this gap, we propose RelFCI, a sound and complete causal discovery algorithm for relational data with latent confounders. Our work builds upon the Fast Causal Inference (FCI) and Relational Causal Discovery (RCD) algorithms and it defines new graphical models, necessary to support causal discovery in relational domains. We also establish soundness and completeness guarantees for relational d-separation with latent confounders. We present experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of RelFCI in identifying the correct causal structure in relational causal models with latent confounders.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose to incorporate the blackboard architecture into LLM multi-agent systems (MASs) so that (1) agents with various roles can share all the information and others' messages during the whole problem-solving process, (2) agents that will take actions are selected based on the current content of the blackboard, and (3) the selection and execution round is repeated until a consensus is reached on the blackboard. We develop the first implementation of this proposal and conduct experiments on commonsense knowledge, reasoning and mathematical datasets. The results show that our system can be competitive with the SOTA static and dynamic MASs by achieving the best average performance, and at the same time manage to spend less tokens. Our proposal has the potential to enable complex and dynamic problem-solving where well-defined structures or workflows are unavailable.

Abstract: The proliferation of multimodal memes in the social media era demands that multimodal Large Language Models (mLLMs) effectively understand meme harmfulness. Existing benchmarks for assessing mLLMs on harmful meme understanding rely on accuracy-based, model-agnostic evaluations using static datasets. These benchmarks are limited in their ability to provide up-to-date and thorough assessments, as online memes evolve dynamically. To address this, we propose AdamMeme, a flexible, agent-based evaluation framework that adaptively probes the reasoning capabilities of mLLMs in deciphering meme harmfulness. Through multi-agent collaboration, AdamMeme provides comprehensive evaluations by iteratively updating the meme data with challenging samples, thereby exposing specific limitations in how mLLMs interpret harmfulness. Extensive experiments show that our framework systematically reveals the varying performance of different target mLLMs, offering in-depth, fine-grained analyses of model-specific weaknesses. Our code is available at https://github.com/Lbotirx/AdamMeme.

<title>Towards culturally-appropriate conversational AI for health in the majority world: An exploratory study with citizens and professionals in Latin America</title>

Abstract: There is justifiable interest in leveraging conversational AI (CAI) for health across the majority world, but to be effective, CAI must respond appropriately within culturally and linguistically diverse contexts. Therefore, we need ways to address the fact that current LLMs exclude many lived experiences globally. Various advances are underway which focus on top-down approaches and increasing training data. In this paper, we aim to complement these with a bottom-up locally-grounded approach based on qualitative data collected during participatory workshops in Latin America. Our goal is to construct a rich and human-centred understanding of: a) potential areas of cultural misalignment in digital health; b) regional perspectives on chatbots for health and c)strategies for creating culturally-appropriate CAI; with a focus on the understudied Latin American context. Our findings show that academic boundaries on notions of culture lose meaning at the ground level and technologies will need to engage with a broader framework; one that encapsulates the way economics, politics, geography and local logistics are entangled in cultural experience. To this end, we introduce a framework for 'Pluriversal Conversational AI for Health' which allows for the possibility that more relationality and tolerance, rather than just more data, may be called for.

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization is the workhorse of deep learning, offering efficient and scalable training via backpropagation. However, its reliance on large volumes of labeled data raises privacy and security concerns such as susceptibility to data poisoning attacks and the risk of overfitting. In contrast, black box optimization methods, which treat the model as an opaque function, relying solely on function evaluations to guide optimization, offer a promising alternative in scenarios where data access is restricted, adversarial risks are high, or overfitting is a concern. However, black box methods also pose significant challenges, including poor scalability to high-dimensional parameter spaces, as prevalent in large language models (LLMs), and high computational costs due to reliance on numerous model evaluations. This paper introduces BBoxER, an evolutionary black-box method for LLM post-training that induces an information bottleneck via implicit compression of the training data. Leveraging the tractability of information flow, we provide strong theoretical bounds on generalization, differential privacy, susceptibility to data poisoning attacks, and robustness to extraction attacks. BBoxER operates on top of pre-trained LLMs, offering a lightweight and modular enhancement suitable for deployment in restricted or privacy-sensitive environments, in addition to non-vacuous generalization guarantees. In experiments with LLMs, we demonstrate empirically that Retrofitting methods are able to learn, showing how a few iterations of BBoxER improve performance and generalize well on a benchmark of reasoning datasets. This positions BBoxER as an attractive add-on on top of gradient-based optimization.

Abstract: Although generative models have made remarkable progress in recent years, their use in critical applications has been hindered by their incapacity to reliably evaluate sample quality. Quality refers to at least two complementary concepts: fidelity and coverage. Current quality metrics often lack reliable, interpretable values due to an absence of calibration or insufficient robustness to outliers. To address these shortcomings, we introduce two novel metrics, Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage. By clipping individual sample contributions and, for fidelity, the radii of nearest neighbor balls, our metrics prevent out-of-distribution samples from biasing the aggregated values. Through analytical and empirical calibration, these metrics exhibit linear score degradation as the proportion of poor samples increases. Thus, they can be straightforwardly interpreted as equivalent proportions of good samples. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage outperform existing methods in terms of robustness, sensitivity, and interpretability for evaluating generative models.

<title>GPU-based complete search for nonlinear minimization subject to bounds</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces a GPU-based complete search method to enclose the global minimum of a nonlinear function subject to simple bounds on the variables. Using interval analysis, coupled with the computational power and architecture of GPU, the method iteratively rules out the regions in the search domain where the global minimum cannot exist and leaves a finite set of regions where the global minimum must exist. For effectiveness, because of the rigor of interval analysis, the method is guaranteed to enclose the global minimum of the nonlinear function even in the presence of rounding errors. For efficiency, the method employs a novel GPU-based single program, single data parallel programming style to circumvent major GPU performance bottlenecks, and a variable cycling technique is also integrated into the method to reduce computational cost when minimizing large-scale nonlinear functions. The method is validated by minimizing 10 multimodal benchmark test functions with scalable dimensions, including the well-known Ackley function, Griewank function, Levy function, and Rastrigin function. These benchmark test functions represent grand challenges of global optimization, and enclosing the guaranteed global minimum of these benchmark test functions with more than 80 dimensions has not been reported in the literature. Our method completely searches the feasible domain and successfully encloses the guaranteed global minimum of these 10 benchmark test functions with up to 10,000 dimensions using only one GPU in a reasonable computation time, far exceeding the reported results in the literature due to the unique method design and implementation based on GPU architecture.

Abstract: We introduce BranchNet, a neuro-symbolic learning framework that transforms decision tree ensembles into sparse, partially connected neural networks. Each branch, defined as a decision path from root to a parent of leaves, is mapped to a hidden neuron, preserving symbolic structure while enabling gradient-based optimization. The resulting models are compact, interpretable, and require no manual architecture tuning. Evaluated on a suite of structured multi-class classification benchmarks, BranchNet consistently outperforms XGBoost in accuracy, with statistically significant gains. We detail the architecture, training procedure, and sparsity dynamics, and discuss the model's strengths in symbolic interpretability as well as its current limitations, particularly on binary tasks where further adaptive calibration may be beneficial.

Abstract: Data quality is a critical driver of large language model performance, yet existing model-based selection methods focus almost exclusively on English. We introduce MuRating, a scalable framework that transfers high-quality English data-quality signals into a single rater for 17 target languages. MuRating aggregates multiple English "raters" via pairwise comparisons to learn unified document-quality scores,then projects these judgments through translation to train a multilingual evaluator on monolingual, cross-lingual, and parallel text pairs. Applied to web data, MuRating selects balanced subsets of English and multilingual content to pretrain a 1.2 B-parameter LLaMA model. Compared to strong baselines, including QuRater, AskLLM, DCLM and so on, our approach boosts average accuracy on both English benchmarks and multilingual evaluations, with especially large gains on knowledge-intensive tasks. We further analyze translation fidelity, selection biases, and underrepresentation of narrative material, outlining directions for future work.

Abstract: Language models can distinguish between testing and deployment phases -- a capability known as evaluation awareness. This has significant safety and policy implications, potentially undermining the reliability of evaluations that are central to AI governance frameworks and voluntary industry commitments. In this paper, we study evaluation awareness in Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. We show that linear probes can separate real-world evaluation and deployment prompts, suggesting that current models internally represent this distinction. We also find that current safety evaluations are correctly classified by the probes, suggesting that they already appear artificial or inauthentic to models. Our findings underscore the importance of ensuring trustworthy evaluations and understanding deceptive capabilities. More broadly, our work showcases how model internals may be leveraged to support blackbox methods in safety audits, especially for future models more competent at evaluation awareness and deception.

<title>Are Vision Transformer Representations Semantically Meaningful? A Case Study in Medical Imaging</title>

Abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs) have rapidly gained prominence in medical imaging tasks such as disease classification, segmentation, and detection due to their superior accuracy compared to conventional deep learning models. However, due to their size and complex interactions via the self-attention mechanism, they are not well understood. In particular, it is unclear whether the representations produced by such models are semantically meaningful. In this paper, using a projected gradient-based algorithm, we show that their representations are not semantically meaningful and they are inherently vulnerable to small changes. Images with imperceptible differences can have very different representations; on the other hand, images that should belong to different semantic classes can have nearly identical representations. Such vulnerability can lead to unreliable classification results; for example, unnoticeable changes cause the classification accuracy to be reduced by over 60\%. %. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically demonstrate this fundamental lack of semantic meaningfulness in ViT representations for medical image classification, revealing a critical challenge for their deployment in safety-critical systems.

Abstract: AI models are increasingly required to be multimodal, integrating disparate input streams into a coherent state representation on which subsequent behaviors and actions can be based. This paper seeks to understand how such models behave when input streams present conflicting information. Focusing specifically on vision-language models, we provide inconsistent inputs (e.g., an image of a dog paired with the caption "A photo of a cat") and ask the model to report the information present in one of the specific modalities (e.g., "What does the caption say / What is in the image?"). We find that models often favor one modality over the other, e.g., reporting the image regardless of what the caption says, but that different models differ in which modality they favor. We find evidence that the behaviorally preferred modality is evident in the internal representational structure of the model, and that specific attention heads can restructure the representations to favor one modality over the other. Moreover, we find modality-agnostic "router heads" which appear to promote answers about the modality requested in the instruction, and which can be manipulated or transferred in order to improve performance across datasets and modalities. Together, the work provides essential steps towards identifying and controlling if and how models detect and resolve conflicting signals within complex multimodal environments.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adapters (LoRAs) have transformed the fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling parameter-efficient updates. However, their widespread adoption remains limited by the reliance on GPU-based training. In this work, we propose a theoretically grounded approach to LoRA fine-tuning designed specifically for users with limited computational resources, particularly those restricted to standard laptop CPUs. Our method learns a meta-operator that maps any input dataset, represented as a probability distribution, to a set of LoRA weights by leveraging a large bank of pre-trained adapters for the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 model. Instead of performing new gradient-based updates, our pipeline constructs adapters via lightweight combinations of existing LoRAs directly on CPU. While the resulting adapters do not match the performance of GPU-trained counterparts, they consistently outperform the base Mistral model on downstream tasks, offering a practical and accessible alternative to traditional GPU-based fine-tuning.

Abstract: Small- and medium-sized manufacturers need innovative data tools but, because of competition and privacy concerns, often do not want to share their proprietary data with researchers who might be interested in helping. This paper introduces a privacy-preserving platform by which manufacturers may safely share their data with researchers through secure methods, so that those researchers then create innovative tools to solve the manufacturers' real-world problems, and then provide tools that execute solutions back onto the platform for others to use with privacy and confidentiality guarantees. We illustrate this problem through a particular use case which addresses an important problem in the large-scale manufacturing of food crystals, which is that quality control relies on image analysis tools. Previous to our research, food crystals in the images were manually counted, which required substantial and time-consuming human efforts, but we have developed and deployed a crystal analysis tool which makes this process both more rapid and accurate. The tool enables automatic characterization of the crystal size distribution and numbers from microscope images while the natural imperfections from the sample preparation are automatically removed; a machine learning model to count high resolution translucent crystals and agglomeration of crystals was also developed to aid in these efforts. The resulting algorithm was then packaged for real-world use on the factory floor via a web-based app secured through the originating privacy-preserving platform, allowing manufacturers to use it while keeping their proprietary data secure. After demonstrating this full process, future directions are also explored.

Abstract: We proposes a novel method that enables Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to solve SAT problems by leveraging a technique developed for applying GNNs to Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). Specifically, k-CNF formulae are mapped into MILP problems, which are then encoded as weighted bipartite graphs and subsequently fed into a GNN for training and testing. From a theoretical perspective: (i) we establish permutation and equivalence invariance results, demonstrating that the method produces outputs that are stable under reordering of clauses and variables; (ii) we identify a theoretical limitation, showing that for a class of formulae called foldable formulae, standard GNNs cannot always distinguish satisfiable from unsatisfiable instances; (iii) we prove a universal approximation theorem, establishing that with Random Node Initialization (RNI), the method can approximate SAT solving to arbitrary precision on finite datasets, that is, the GNN becomes approximately sound and complete on such datasets. Furthermore, we show that for unfoldable formulae, the same approximation guarantee can be achieved without the need for RNI. Finally, we conduct an experimental evaluation of our approach, which show that, despite the simplicity of the neural architecture, the method achieves promising results.

Abstract: Edge devices for temporal processing demand models that capture both short- and long- range dynamics under tight memory constraints. While Transformers excel at sequence modeling, their quadratic memory scaling with sequence length makes them impractical for such settings. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) offer constant memory but train sequentially, and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), though efficient, scale memory with kernel size. To address this, we propose mGRADE (mininally Gated Recurrent Architecture with Delay Embedding), a hybrid-memory system that integrates a temporal 1D-convolution with learnable spacings followed by a minimal gated recurrent unit (minGRU). This design allows the convolutional layer to realize a flexible delay embedding that captures rapid temporal variations, while the recurrent module efficiently maintains global context with minimal memory overhead. We validate our approach on two synthetic tasks, demonstrating that mGRADE effectively separates and preserves multi-scale temporal features. Furthermore, on challenging pixel-by-pixel image classification benchmarks, mGRADE consistently outperforms both pure convolutional and pure recurrent counterparts using approximately 20% less memory footprint, highlighting its suitability for memory-constrained temporal processing at the edge. This highlights mGRADE's promise as an efficient solution for memory-constrained multi-scale temporal processing at the edge.

Abstract: Domain specific chatbot applications often involve multi step interactions, such as refining search filters, selecting multiple items, or performing comparisons. Traditional graphical user interfaces (GUIs) handle these workflows by providing explicit "Submit" (commit data) and "Reset" (discard data) actions, allowing back-end systems to track user intent unambiguously. In contrast, conversational agents rely on subtle language cues, which can lead to confusion and incomplete context management. This paper proposes modeling these GUI inspired metaphors acknowledgment (submit like) and context switching (reset-like) as explicit tasks within large language model (LLM) prompts. By capturing user acknowledgment, reset actions, and chain of thought (CoT) reasoning as structured session data, we preserve clarity, reduce user confusion, and align domain-specific chatbot interactions with back-end logic. We demonstrate our approach in hotel booking and customer management scenarios, highlighting improvements in multi-turn task coherence, user satisfaction, and efficiency.

Abstract: We investigate a novel approach to time-series modeling, inspired by the successes of large pretrained foundation models. We introduce FAE (Foundation Auto-Encoders), a foundation generative-AI model for anomaly detection in time-series data, based on Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs). By foundation, we mean a model pretrained on massive amounts of time-series data which can learn complex temporal patterns useful for accurate modeling, forecasting, and detection of anomalies on previously unseen datasets. FAE leverages VAEs and Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) to build a generic model for univariate time-series modeling, which could eventually perform properly in out-of-the-box, zero-shot anomaly detection applications. We introduce the main concepts of FAE, and present preliminary results in different multi-dimensional time-series datasets from various domains, including a real dataset from an operational mobile ISP, and the well known KDD 2021 Anomaly Detection dataset.

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex domains such as logical reasoning and experimental coding. Motivated by these advancements, numerous studies have explored the application of AI in the innovation process, particularly in the context of scientific research. These AI technologies primarily aim to develop systems that can autonomously conduct research processes across a wide range of scientific disciplines. Despite these significant strides, a comprehensive survey on AI for Research (AI4Research) remains absent, which hampers our understanding and impedes further development in this field. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive survey and offer a unified perspective on AI4Research. Specifically, the main contributions of our work are as follows: (1) Systematic taxonomy: We first introduce a systematic taxonomy to classify five mainstream tasks in AI4Research. (2) New frontiers: Then, we identify key research gaps and highlight promising future directions, focusing on the rigor and scalability of automated experiments, as well as the societal impact. (3) Abundant applications and resources: Finally, we compile a wealth of resources, including relevant multidisciplinary applications, data corpora, and tools. We hope our work will provide the research community with quick access to these resources and stimulate innovative breakthroughs in AI4Research.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a powerful technique for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, effectively aligning LLMs with diverse human preferences remains a significant challenge, particularly when they are conflict. To address this issue, we frame human value alignment as a multi-objective optimization problem, aiming to maximize a set of potentially conflicting objectives. We introduce Gradient-Adaptive Policy Optimization (GAPO), a novel fine-tuning paradigm that employs multiple-gradient descent to align LLMs with diverse preference distributions. GAPO adaptively rescales the gradients for each objective to determine an update direction that optimally balances the trade-offs between objectives. Additionally, we introduce P-GAPO, which incorporates user preferences across different objectives and achieves Pareto solutions that better align with the user's specific needs. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that GAPO converges towards a Pareto optimal solution for multiple objectives. Empirical results on Mistral-7B show that GAPO outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in both helpfulness and harmlessness.

<title>End-to-End Large Portfolio Optimization for Variance Minimization with Neural Networks through Covariance Cleaning</title>

Abstract: We develop a rotation-invariant neural network that provides the global minimum-variance portfolio by jointly learning how to lag-transform historical returns and how to regularise both the eigenvalues and the marginal volatilities of large equity covariance matrices. This explicit mathematical mapping offers clear interpretability of each module's role, so the model cannot be regarded as a pure black-box. The architecture mirrors the analytical form of the global minimum-variance solution yet remains agnostic to dimension, so a single model can be calibrated on panels of a few hundred stocks and applied, without retraining, to one thousand US equities-a cross-sectional jump that demonstrates robust out-of-sample generalisation. The loss function is the future realized minimum portfolio variance and is optimized end-to-end on real daily returns. In out-of-sample tests from January 2000 to December 2024 the estimator delivers systematically lower realised volatility, smaller maximum drawdowns, and higher Sharpe ratios than the best analytical competitors, including state-of-the-art non-linear shrinkage. Furthermore, although the model is trained end-to-end to produce an unconstrained (long-short) minimum-variance portfolio, we show that its learned covariance representation can be used in general optimizers under long-only constraints with virtually no loss in its performance advantage over competing estimators. These gains persist when the strategy is executed under a highly realistic implementation framework that models market orders at the auctions, empirical slippage, exchange fees, and financing charges for leverage, and they remain stable during episodes of acute market stress.

Abstract: The complexity of mental healthcare billing enables anomalies, including fraud. While machine learning methods have been applied to anomaly detection, they often struggle with class imbalance, label scarcity, and complex sequential patterns. This study explores a hybrid deep learning approach combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Transformers, with pseudo-labeling via Isolation Forests (iForest) and Autoencoders (AE). Prior work has not evaluated such hybrid models trained on pseudo-labeled data in the context of healthcare billing. The approach is evaluated on two real-world billing datasets related to mental healthcare. The iForest LSTM baseline achieves the highest recall (0.963) on declaration-level data. On the operation-level data, the hybrid iForest-based model achieves the highest recall (0.744), though at the cost of lower precision. These findings highlight the potential of combining pseudo-labeling with hybrid deep learning in complex, imbalanced anomaly detection settings.

Abstract: In recent years, neural models trained on large multilingual text and speech datasets have shown great potential for supporting low-resource languages. This study investigates the performances of two state-of-the-art Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models, OpenAI's Whisper (Small & Large-V2) and Facebook's Wav2Vec-BERT on Bangla, a low-resource language. We have conducted experiments using two publicly available datasets: Mozilla Common Voice-17 and OpenSLR to evaluate model performances. Through systematic fine-tuning and hyperparameter optimization, including learning rate, epochs, and model checkpoint selection, we have compared the models based on Word Error Rate (WER), Character Error Rate (CER), Training Time, and Computational Efficiency. The Wav2Vec-BERT model outperformed Whisper across all key evaluation metrics, demonstrated superior performance while requiring fewer computational resources, and offered valuable insights to develop robust speech recognition systems in low-resource linguistic settings.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language understanding through vast datasets and large-scale parameterization. Inspired by this success, we present SpecCLIP, a foundation model framework that extends LLM-inspired methodologies to stellar spectral analysis. Stellar spectra, akin to structured language, encode rich physical and chemical information about stars. By training foundation models on large-scale spectral datasets, our goal is to learn robust and informative embeddings that support diverse downstream applications. As a proof of concept, SpecCLIP involves pre-training on two spectral types--LAMOST low-resolution and Gaia XP--followed by contrastive alignment using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) framework, adapted to associate spectra from different instruments. This alignment is complemented by auxiliary decoders that preserve spectrum-specific information and enable translation (prediction) between spectral types, with the former achieved by maximizing mutual information between embeddings and input spectra. The result is a cross-spectrum framework enabling intrinsic calibration and flexible applications across instruments. We demonstrate that fine-tuning these models on moderate-sized labeled datasets improves adaptability to tasks such as stellar-parameter estimation and chemical-abundance determination. SpecCLIP also enhances the accuracy and precision of parameter estimates benchmarked against external survey data. Additionally, its similarity search and cross-spectrum prediction capabilities offer potential for anomaly detection. Our results suggest that contrastively trained foundation models enriched with spectrum-aware decoders can advance precision stellar spectroscopy.

<title>How Well Does GPT-4o Understand Vision? Evaluating Multimodal Foundation Models on Standard Computer Vision Tasks</title>

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models, such as GPT-4o, have recently made remarkable progress, but it is not clear where exactly these models stand in terms of understanding vision. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of popular multimodal foundation models (GPT-4o, o4-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 2.0 Flash, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Qwen2-VL, Llama 3.2) on standard computer vision tasks (semantic segmentation, object detection, image classification, depth and surface normal prediction) using established datasets (e.g., COCO, ImageNet and its variants, etc).
  The main challenges to performing this are: 1) most models are trained to output text and cannot natively express versatile domains, such as segments or 3D geometry, and 2) many leading models are proprietary and accessible only at an API level, i.e., there is no weight access to adapt them. We address these challenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable and API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized benchmarking framework.
  We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art specialist models at any task. However, 2) they are respectable generalists; this is remarkable as they are presumably trained on primarily image-text-based tasks. 3) They perform semantic tasks notably better than geometric ones. 4) While the prompt-chaining techniques affect performance, better models exhibit less sensitivity to prompt variations. 5) GPT-4o performs the best among non-reasoning models, securing the top position in 4 out of 6 tasks, 6) reasoning models, e.g. o3, show improvements in geometric tasks, and 7) a preliminary analysis of models with native image generation, like the latest GPT-4o, shows they exhibit quirks like hallucinations and spatial misalignments.

Abstract: We present Locality-aware Parallel Decoding (LPD) to accelerate autoregressive image generation. Traditional autoregressive image generation relies on next-patch prediction, a memory-bound process that leads to high latency. Existing works have tried to parallelize next-patch prediction by shifting to multi-patch prediction to accelerate the process, but only achieved limited parallelization. To achieve high parallelization while maintaining generation quality, we introduce two key techniques: (1) Flexible Parallelized Autoregressive Modeling, a novel architecture that enables arbitrary generation ordering and degrees of parallelization. It uses learnable position query tokens to guide generation at target positions while ensuring mutual visibility among concurrently generated tokens for consistent parallel decoding. (2) Locality-aware Generation Ordering, a novel schedule that forms groups to minimize intra-group dependencies and maximize contextual support, enhancing generation quality. With these designs, we reduce the generation steps from 256 to 20 (256$\times$256 res.) and 1024 to 48 (512$\times$512 res.) without compromising quality on the ImageNet class-conditional generation, and achieving at least 3.4$\times$ lower latency than previous parallelized autoregressive models.

<title>AC-DiT: Adaptive Coordination Diffusion Transformer for Mobile Manipulation</title>

Abstract: Recently, mobile manipulation has attracted increasing attention for enabling language-conditioned robotic control in household tasks. However, existing methods still face challenges in coordinating mobile base and manipulator, primarily due to two limitations. On the one hand, they fail to explicitly model the influence of the mobile base on manipulator control, which easily leads to error accumulation under high degrees of freedom. On the other hand, they treat the entire mobile manipulation process with the same visual observation modality (e.g., either all 2D or all 3D), overlooking the distinct multimodal perception requirements at different stages during mobile manipulation. To address this, we propose the Adaptive Coordination Diffusion Transformer (AC-DiT), which enhances mobile base and manipulator coordination for end-to-end mobile manipulation. First, since the motion of the mobile base directly influences the manipulator's actions, we introduce a mobility-to-body conditioning mechanism that guides the model to first extract base motion representations, which are then used as context prior for predicting whole-body actions. This enables whole-body control that accounts for the potential impact of the mobile base's motion. Second, to meet the perception requirements at different stages of mobile manipulation, we design a perception-aware multimodal conditioning strategy that dynamically adjusts the fusion weights between various 2D visual images and 3D point clouds, yielding visual features tailored to the current perceptual needs. This allows the model to, for example, adaptively rely more on 2D inputs when semantic information is crucial for action prediction, while placing greater emphasis on 3D geometric information when precise spatial understanding is required. We validate AC-DiT through extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world mobile manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Entity alignment (EA) aims at identifying equivalent entity pairs across different knowledge graphs (KGs) that refer to the same real-world identity. To circumvent the shortage of seed alignments provided for training, recent EA models utilize pseudo-labeling strategies to iteratively add unaligned entity pairs predicted with high confidence to the seed alignments for model training. However, the adverse impact of confirmation bias during pseudo-labeling has been largely overlooked, thus hindering entity alignment performance. To systematically combat confirmation bias for pseudo-labeling-based entity alignment, we propose a Unified Pseudo-Labeling framework for Entity Alignment (UPL-EA) that explicitly eliminates pseudo-labeling errors to boost the accuracy of entity alignment. UPL-EA consists of two complementary components: (1) Optimal Transport (OT)-based pseudo-labeling uses discrete OT modeling as an effective means to determine entity correspondences and reduce erroneous matches across two KGs. An effective criterion is derived to infer pseudo-labeled alignments that satisfy one-to-one correspondences; (2) Parallel pseudo-label ensembling refines pseudo-labeled alignments by combining predictions over multiple models independently trained in parallel. The ensembled pseudo-labeled alignments are thereafter used to augment seed alignments to reinforce subsequent model training for alignment inference. The effectiveness of UPL-EA in eliminating pseudo-labeling errors is both theoretically supported and experimentally validated. Our extensive results and in-depth analyses demonstrate the superiority of UPL-EA over 15 competitive baselines and its utility as a general pseudo-labeling framework for entity alignment.

Abstract: Understanding human mobility patterns has long been a challenging task in transportation modeling. Due to the difficulties in obtaining high-quality training datasets across diverse locations, conventional activity-based models and learning-based human mobility modeling algorithms are particularly limited by the availability and quality of datasets. Current approaches primarily focus on spatial-temporal patterns while neglecting semantic relationships such as logical connections or dependencies between activities and household coordination activities like joint shopping trips or family meal times, both crucial for realistic mobility modeling. We propose a retrieval-augmented large language model (LLM) framework that generates activity chains with household coordination using only public accessible statistical and socio-demographic information, reducing the need for sophisticated mobility data. The retrieval-augmentation mechanism enables household coordination and maintains statistical consistency across generated patterns, addressing a key gap in existing methods. Our validation with NHTS and SCAG-ABM datasets demonstrates effective mobility synthesis and strong adaptability for regions with limited mobility data availability.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive way to observe brain activity in real time. Deep learning has enhanced EEG analysis, enabling meaningful pattern detection for clinical and research purposes. However, most existing frameworks for EEG data analysis are either focused on preprocessing techniques or deep learning model development, often overlooking the crucial need for structured documentation and model interpretability. In this paper, we introduce DREAMS (Deep REport for AI ModelS), a Python-based framework designed to generate automated model cards for deep learning models applied to EEG data. Unlike generic model reporting tools, DREAMS is specifically tailored for EEG-based deep learning applications, incorporating domain-specific metadata, preprocessing details, performance metrics, and uncertainty quantification. The framework seamlessly integrates with deep learning pipelines, providing structured YAML-based documentation. We evaluate DREAMS through two case studies: an EEG emotion classification task using the FACED dataset and a abnormal EEG classification task using the Temple Univeristy Hospital (TUH) Abnormal dataset. These evaluations demonstrate how the generated model card enhances transparency by documenting model performance, dataset biases, and interpretability limitations. Unlike existing model documentation approaches, DREAMS provides visualized performance metrics, dataset alignment details, and model uncertainty estimations, making it a valuable tool for researchers and clinicians working with EEG-based AI. The source code for DREAMS is open-source, facilitating broad adoption in healthcare AI, research, and ethical AI development.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in code generation. However, in the factory automation sector, particularly motion control, manual programming, alongside inefficient and unsafe debugging practices, remains prevalent. This stems from the complex interplay of mechanical and electrical systems and stringent safety requirements. Moreover, most current AI-assisted motion control programming efforts focus on PLCs, with little attention given to high-level languages and function libraries. To address these challenges, we introduce MCCoder, an LLM-powered system tailored for generating motion control code, integrated with a soft-motion controller. MCCoder improves code generation through a structured workflow that combines multitask decomposition, hybrid retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and iterative self-correction, utilizing a well-established motion library. Additionally, it integrates a 3D simulator for intuitive motion validation and logs of full motion trajectories for data verification, significantly enhancing accuracy and safety. In the absence of benchmark datasets and metrics tailored for evaluating motion control code generation, we propose MCEVAL, a dataset spanning motion tasks of varying complexity. Experiments show that MCCoder outperforms baseline models using Advanced RAG, achieving an overall performance gain of 33.09% and a 131.77% improvement on complex tasks in the MCEVAL dataset.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in chart understanding tasks. However, interpreting charts with textual descriptions often leads to information loss, as it fails to fully capture the dense information embedded in charts. In contrast, parsing charts into code provides lossless representations that can effectively contain all critical details. Although existing open-source MLLMs have achieved success in chart understanding tasks, they still face two major challenges when applied to chart-to-code tasks: (1) Low executability and poor restoration of chart details in the generated code and (2) Lack of large-scale and diverse training data. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ChartCoder}, the first dedicated chart-to-code MLLM, which leverages Code LLMs as the language backbone to enhance the executability of the generated code. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{Chart2Code-160k}, the first large-scale and diverse dataset for chart-to-code generation, and propose the \textbf{Snippet-of-Thought (SoT)} method, which transforms direct chart-to-code generation data into step-by-step generation. Experiments demonstrate that ChartCoder, with only 7B parameters, surpasses existing open-source MLLMs on chart-to-code benchmarks, achieving superior chart restoration and code excitability. Our code is available at https://github.com/thunlp/ChartCoder.

Abstract: By varying prompts to a large language model, we can elicit the full range of human behaviors in a variety of different scenarios in classic economic games. By analyzing which prompts elicit which behaviors, we can categorize and compare different strategic situations, which can also help provide insight into what different economic scenarios induce people to think about. We discuss how this provides a first step towards a non-standard method of inferring (deciphering) the motivations behind the human behaviors. We also show how this deciphering process can be used to categorize differences in the behavioral tendencies of different populations.

Abstract: In modern medicine, clinical diagnosis relies on the comprehensive analysis of primarily textual and visual data, drawing on medical expertise to ensure systematic and rigorous reasoning. Recent advances in large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and agent-based methods hold great potential for medical diagnosis, thanks to the ability to effectively integrate multi-modal patient data. However, they often provide direct answers and draw empirical-driven conclusions without quantitative analysis, which reduces their reliability and clinical usability. We propose MedAgent-Pro, a new agentic reasoning paradigm that follows the diagnosis principle in modern medicine, to decouple the process into sequential components for step-by-step, evidence-based reasoning. Our MedAgent-Pro workflow presents a hierarchical diagnostic structure to mirror this principle, consisting of disease-level standardized plan generation and patient-level personalized step-by-step reasoning. To support disease-level planning, an RAG-based agent is designed to retrieve medical guidelines to ensure alignment with clinical standards. For patient-level reasoning, we propose to integrate professional tools such as visual models to enable quantitative assessments. Meanwhile, we propose to verify the reliability of each step to achieve evidence-based diagnosis, enforcing rigorous logical reasoning and a well-founded conclusion. Extensive experiments across a wide range of anatomical regions, imaging modalities, and diseases demonstrate the superiority of MedAgent-Pro to mainstream VLMs, agentic systems and state-of-the-art expert models. Ablation studies and human evaluation by clinical experts further validate its robustness and clinical relevance. Code is available at https://github.com/jinlab-imvr/MedAgent-Pro.

Abstract: The road to Artificial General Intelligence goes through the generation of context-aware reactive behaviors, where the Transformer architecture has been proven to be the state-of-the-art. However, they still fail to develop reasoning. Recently, a novel approach for developing cognitive architectures, called Synthetic Cognition, has been proposed and implemented to develop instantaneous reactive behavior. In this study, we aim to explore the use of Synthetic Cognition to develop context-aware reactive behaviors. We propose a mechanism to deal with sequences for the recent implementation of Synthetic Cognition, and test it against DNA foundation models in DNA sequence classification tasks. In our experiments, our proposal clearly outperforms the DNA foundation models, obtaining the best score on more benchmark tasks than the alternatives. Thus, we achieve two goals: expanding Synthetic Cognition to deal with sequences, and beating the Transformer architecture for sequence classification.

<title>Reasoning about Uncertainty: Do Reasoning Models Know When They Don't Know?</title>

Abstract: Reasoning language models have set state-of-the-art (SOTA) records on many challenging benchmarks, enabled by multi-step reasoning induced using reinforcement learning. However, like previous language models, reasoning models are prone to generating confident, plausible responses that are incorrect (hallucinations). Knowing when and how much to trust these models is critical to the safe deployment of reasoning models in real-world applications. To this end, we explore uncertainty quantification of reasoning models in this work. Specifically, we ask three fundamental questions: First, are reasoning models well-calibrated? Second, does deeper reasoning improve model calibration? Finally, inspired by humans' innate ability to double-check their thought processes to verify the validity of their answers and their confidence, we ask: can reasoning models improve their calibration by explicitly reasoning about their chain-of-thought traces? We introduce introspective uncertainty quantification (UQ) to explore this direction. In extensive evaluations on SOTA reasoning models across a broad range of benchmarks, we find that reasoning models: (i) are typically overconfident, with self-verbalized confidence estimates often greater than 85% particularly for incorrect responses, (ii) become even more overconfident with deeper reasoning, and (iii) can become better calibrated through introspection (e.g., o3-Mini and DeepSeek R1) but not uniformly (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet becomes more poorly calibrated). Lastly, we conclude with important research directions to design necessary UQ benchmarks and improve the calibration of reasoning models.

<title>The Boolean Solution Problem from the Perspective of Predicate Logic -- Extended Version</title>

Abstract: Finding solution values for unknowns in Boolean equations was a principal reasoning mode in the Algebra of Logic of the 19th century. Schr\"oder investigated it as Aufl\"osungsproblem (solution problem). It is closely related to the modern notion of Boolean unification. Today it is commonly presented in an algebraic setting, but seems potentially useful also in knowledge representation based on predicate logic. We show that it can be modeled on the basis of first-order logic extended by second-order quantification. A wealth of classical results transfers, foundations for algorithms unfold, and connections with second-order quantifier elimination and Craig interpolation become apparent. Although for first-order inputs the set of solutions is recursively enumerable, the development of constructive methods remains a challenge. We identify some cases that allow constructions, most of them based on Craig interpolation.

Abstract: Dataset Distillation (DD) aims to generate a compact synthetic dataset that enables models to achieve performance comparable to training on the full large dataset, significantly reducing computational costs. Drawing from optimal transport theory, we introduce WMDD (Wasserstein Metric-based Dataset Distillation), a straightforward yet powerful method that employs the Wasserstein metric to enhance distribution matching.
  We compute the Wasserstein barycenter of features from a pretrained classifier to capture essential characteristics of the original data distribution. By optimizing synthetic data to align with this barycenter in feature space and leveraging per-class BatchNorm statistics to preserve intra-class variations, WMDD maintains the efficiency of distribution matching approaches while achieving state-of-the-art results across various high-resolution datasets. Our extensive experiments demonstrate WMDD's effectiveness and adaptability, highlighting its potential for advancing machine learning applications at scale.

Abstract: A growing trend has emerged in designing high-quality Small Language Models (SLMs) with a few million parameters. This trend is driven by the increasing concerns over cloud costs, privacy, and latency. Considering that full parameter training is feasible for SLMs on mobile devices, Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) is employed to improve efficiency by reducing computational overhead and memory footprint. However, previous QAT works adopt fine-grained quantization methods to compress models with billions of parameters on GPUs, incompatible with current commodity hardware, such as mobile and edge devices, which relies on Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) instructions. Thus, the generalization of these methods to SLMs on mobile devices is limited. In this paper, we propose Squat method, an effective QAT framework with deployable quantization for SLMs on mobile devices. Specifically, we propose entropy-guided and distribution-aligned distillation to mitigate the distortion of attention information from quantization. Besides, we employ sub-8-bit token adaptive quantization, assigning varying bit widths to different tokens based on their importance. Furthermore, we develop a SIMD-based Multi-Kernel Mixed-Precision (MKMP) multiplier to support sub-8-bit mixed-precision MAC on mobile devices. Our extensive experiments verify the substantial improvements of our method compared to other QAT methods across various datasets. Furthermore, we achieve an on-device speedup of up to 2.37x compared with its FP16 counterparts, signaling a great advancement. Code: https://github.com/shawnricecake/squant

<title>SpikeNAS: A Fast Memory-Aware Neural Architecture Search Framework for Spiking Neural Network-based Embedded AI Systems</title>

Abstract: Embedded AI systems are expected to incur low power/energy consumption for solving machine learning tasks, as these systems are usually power constrained (e.g., object recognition task in autonomous mobile agents with portable batteries). These requirements can be fulfilled by Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), since their bio-inspired spike-based operations offer high accuracy and ultra low-power/energy computation. Currently, most of SNN architectures are derived from Artificial Neural Networks whose neurons' architectures and operations are different from SNNs, and/or developed without considering memory budgets from the underlying processing hardware of embedded platforms. These limitations hinder SNNs from reaching their full potential in accuracy and efficiency. Toward this, we propose SpikeNAS, a novel fast memory-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework for SNNs that quickly finds an appropriate SNN architecture with high accuracy under the given memory budgets from targeted embedded systems. To do this, our SpikeNAS employs several key steps: analyzing the impacts of network operations on the accuracy, enhancing the network architecture to improve the learning quality, developing a fast memory-aware search algorithm, and performing quantization. The experimental results show that our SpikeNAS improves the searching time and maintains high accuracy compared to state-of-the-art while meeting the given memory budgets (e.g., 29x, 117x, and 3.7x faster search for CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet200 respectively, using an Nvidia RTX A6000 GPU machine), thereby quickly providing the appropriate SNN architecture for the memory-constrained embedded AI systems.

Abstract: The recent surge of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to claims that they are approaching a level of creativity akin to human capabilities. This idea has sparked a blend of excitement and apprehension. However, a critical piece that has been missing in this discourse is a systematic evaluation of LLMs' semantic diversity, particularly in comparison to human divergent thinking. To bridge this gap, we leverage recent advances in computational creativity to analyze semantic divergence in both state-of-the-art LLMs and a substantial dataset of 100,000 humans. We found evidence that LLMs can surpass average human performance on the Divergent Association Task, and approach human creative writing abilities, though they fall short of the typical performance of highly creative humans. Notably, even the top performing LLMs are still largely surpassed by highly creative individuals, underscoring a ceiling that current LLMs still fail to surpass. Our human-machine benchmarking framework addresses the polemic surrounding the imminent replacement of human creative labour by AI, disentangling the quality of the respective creative linguistic outputs using established objective measures. While prompting deeper exploration of the distinctive elements of human inventive thought compared to those of AI systems, we lay out a series of techniques to improve their outputs with respect to semantic diversity, such as prompt design and hyper-parameter tuning.

Abstract: Teeth segmentation and recognition play a vital role in a variety of dental applications and diagnostic procedures. The integration of deep learning models has facilitated the development of precise and automated segmentation methods. Although prior research has explored teeth segmentation, not many methods have successfully performed tooth segmentation and detection simultaneously. This study presents UFBA-425, a dental dataset derived from the UFBA-UESC dataset, featuring bounding box and polygon annotations for 425 panoramic dental X-rays. In addition, this paper presents the OralBBNet architecture, which is based on the best segmentation and detection qualities of architectures such as U-Net and YOLOv8, respectively. OralBBNet is designed to improve the accuracy and robustness of tooth classification and segmentation on panoramic X-rays by leveraging the complementary strengths of U-Net and YOLOv8. Our approach achieved a 1-3% improvement in mean average precision (mAP) for tooth detection compared to existing techniques and a 15-20% improvement in the dice score for teeth segmentation over state-of-the-art (SOTA) solutions for various tooth categories and 2-4% improvement in the dice score compared to other SOTA segmentation architectures. The results of this study establish a foundation for the wider implementation of object detection models in dental diagnostics.

<title>Improving Consistency Models with Generator-Augmented Flows</title>

Abstract: Consistency models imitate the multi-step sampling of score-based diffusion in a single forward pass of a neural network. They can be learned in two ways: consistency distillation and consistency training. The former relies on the true velocity field of the corresponding differential equation, approximated by a pre-trained neural network. In contrast, the latter uses a single-sample Monte Carlo estimate of this velocity field. The related estimation error induces a discrepancy between consistency distillation and training that, we show, still holds in the continuous-time limit. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel flow that transports noisy data towards their corresponding outputs derived from a consistency model. We prove that this flow reduces the previously identified discrepancy and the noise-data transport cost. Consequently, our method not only accelerates consistency training convergence but also enhances its overall performance. The code is available at: https://github.com/thibautissenhuth/consistency_GC.

arXiv:2406.11818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enabling embodied agents to complete complex human instructions from natural language is crucial to autonomous systems in household services. Conventional methods can only accomplish human instructions in the known environment where all interactive objects are provided to the embodied agent, and directly deploying the existing approaches for the unknown environment usually generates infeasible plans that manipulate non-existing objects. On the contrary, we propose an embodied instruction following (EIF) method for complex tasks in the unknown environment, where the agent efficiently explores the unknown environment to generate feasible plans with existing objects to accomplish abstract instructions. Specifically, we build a hierarchical embodied instruction following framework including the high-level task planner and the low-level exploration controller with multimodal large language models. We then construct a semantic representation map of the scene with dynamic region attention to demonstrate the known visual clues, where the goal of task planning and scene exploration is aligned for human instruction. For the task planner, we generate the feasible step-by-step plans for human goal accomplishment according to the task completion process and the known visual clues. For the exploration controller, the optimal navigation or object interaction policy is predicted based on the generated step-wise plans and the known visual clues. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve 45.09% success rate in 204 complex human instructions such as making breakfast and tidying rooms in large house-level scenes.

Abstract: Recent advances in large text-conditional diffusion models have revolutionized image generation by enabling users to create realistic, high-quality images from textual prompts, significantly enhancing artistic creation and visual communication. However, these advancements also introduce an underexplored attack opportunity: the possibility of inducing biases by an adversary into the generated images for malicious intentions, e.g., to influence public opinion and spread propaganda. In this paper, we study an attack vector that allows an adversary to inject arbitrary bias into a target model. The attack leverages low-cost backdooring techniques using a targeted set of natural textual triggers embedded within a small number of malicious data samples produced with public generative models. An adversary could pick common sequences of words that can then be inadvertently activated by benign users during inference. We investigate the feasibility and challenges of such attacks, demonstrating how modern generative models have made this adversarial process both easier and more adaptable. On the other hand, we explore various aspects of the detectability of such attacks and demonstrate that the model's utility remains intact in the absence of the triggers. Our extensive experiments using over 200,000 generated images and against hundreds of fine-tuned models demonstrate the feasibility of the presented backdoor attack. We illustrate how these biases maintain strong text-image alignment, highlighting the challenges in detecting biased images without knowing that bias in advance. Our cost analysis confirms the low financial barrier ($10-$15) to executing such attacks, underscoring the need for robust defensive strategies against such vulnerabilities in diffusion models.

arXiv:2407.17226v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) for a class of continuous-time linear-quadratic (LQ) control problems for diffusions, where states are scalar-valued and running control rewards are absent but volatilities of the state processes depend on both state and control variables. We apply a model-free approach that relies neither on knowledge of model parameters nor on their estimations, and devise an RL algorithm to learn the optimal policy parameter directly. Our main contributions include the introduction of an exploration schedule and a regret analysis of the proposed algorithm. We provide the convergence rate of the policy parameter to the optimal one, and prove that the algorithm achieves a regret bound of $O(N^{\frac{3}{4}})$ up to a logarithmic factor, where $N$ is the number of learning episodes. We conduct a simulation study to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed algorithm. We also perform numerical comparisons between our method and those of the recent model-based stochastic LQ RL studies adapted to the state- and control-dependent volatility setting, demonstrating a better performance of the former in terms of regret bounds.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in every stage of drug development. One challenge facing drug discovery AI is that drug pharmacokinetic (PK) datasets are often collected independently from each other, often with limited overlap, creating data overlap sparsity. Data sparsity makes data curation difficult for researchers looking to answer research questions in poly-pharmacy, drug combination research, and high-throughput screening. We propose Imagand, a novel SMILES-to-Pharmacokinetic (S2PK) diffusion model capable of generating an array of PK target properties conditioned on SMILES inputs. We show that Imagand-generated synthetic PK data closely resembles real data univariate and bivariate distributions, and improves performance for downstream tasks. Imagand is a promising solution for data overlap sparsity and allows researchers to efficiently generate ligand PK data for drug discovery research. Code is available at https://github.com/bing1100/Imagand.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to selectively remove specific knowledge from a trained model. Existing approaches, such as Task Arithmetic, fine-tune the model on the forget set to create a task vector (i.e., a direction in weight space) for subtraction from the original model's weight. However, their effectiveness is highly sensitive to hyperparameter selection, requiring extensive validation to identify the optimal vector from many fine-tuned candidates. In this paper, we propose a novel method that utilizes all fine-tuned models trained with varying hyperparameters instead of a single selection. Specifically, we aggregate the computed task vectors by retaining only the elements with consistent shared signs. The merged task vector is then negated to induce unlearning on the original model. Evaluations on zero-shot and standard image recognition tasks across twelve datasets and four backbone architectures show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods while requiring similar or fewer computational resources.

Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) learn a latent space whose samples can be mapped to real-world images. Such latent spaces are difficult to interpret. Some earlier supervised methods aim to create an interpretable latent space or discover interpretable directions, which requires exploiting data labels or annotated synthesized samples for training. However, we propose using a modification of vector quantization called space-filling vector quantization (SFVQ), which quantizes the data on a piece-wise linear curve. SFVQ can capture the underlying morphological structure of the latent space, making it interpretable. We apply this technique to model the latent space of pre-trained StyleGAN2 and BigGAN networks on various datasets. Our experiments show that the SFVQ curve yields a general interpretable model of the latent space such that it determines which parts of the latent space correspond to specific generative factors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that each line of the SFVQ curve can potentially refer to an interpretable direction for applying intelligible image transformations. We also demonstrate that the points located on an SFVQ line can be used for controllable data augmentation.

Abstract: Task-oriented semantic communication systems have emerged as a promising approach to achieving efficient and intelligent data transmission in next-generation networks, where only information relevant to a specific task is communicated. This is particularly important in 6G-enabled Internet of Things (6G-IoT) scenarios, where bandwidth constraints, latency requirements, and data privacy are critical. However, existing methods struggle to fully disentangle task-relevant and task-irrelevant information, leading to privacy concerns and suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose an information-bottleneck inspired method, named CLAD (contrastive learning and adversarial disentanglement). CLAD utilizes contrastive learning to effectively capture task-relevant features while employing adversarial disentanglement to discard task-irrelevant information. Additionally, due to the absence of reliable and reproducible methods to quantify the minimality of encoded feature vectors, we introduce the Information Retention Index (IRI), a comparative metric used as a proxy for the mutual information between the encoded features and the input. The IRI reflects how minimal and informative the representation is, making it highly relevant for privacy-preserving and bandwidth-efficient 6G-IoT systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLAD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of semantic extraction, task performance, privacy preservation, and IRI, making it a promising building block for responsible, efficient and trustworthy 6G-IoT services.

Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance in vision-language reasoning, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) might generate hallucinated contents that do not exist in the given image. Most existing LVLM hallucination benchmarks are constrained to evaluate the object-related hallucinations. However, the potential hallucination on the relations between two objects, i.e., relation hallucination, still lacks investigation. To remedy that, we design a unified framework to measure the object and relation hallucination in LVLMs simultaneously. The core idea of our framework is to evaluate hallucinations via (object, relation, object) triplets extracted from LVLMs' responses, making it easily generalizable to different vision-language tasks. Based on our framework, we further introduce Tri-HE, a novel Triplet-level Hallucination Evaluation benchmark which can be used to study both object and relation hallucination at the same time. With comprehensive evaluations on Tri-HE, we observe that the relation hallucination issue is even more serious than object hallucination among existing LVLMs, highlighting a previously neglected problem towards reliable LVLMs. Moreover, based on our findings, we design a simple training-free approach that effectively mitigates hallucinations for LVLMs. Our dataset and code for the reproduction of our experiments are available publicly at https://github.com/wujunjie1998/Tri-HE.

Abstract: Diffusion Models achieve state-of-the-art performance in generating new samples but lack a low-dimensional latent space that encodes the data into meaningful features. Inversion-based methods address this by reversing the denoising trajectory, mapping each image back to its approximated starting noise. In this work, we thoroughly analyze this procedure and focus on the relation between the initial Gaussian noise, the generated samples, and their corresponding latent encodings obtained through the DDIM inversion. First, we show that latents exhibit structural patterns in the form of less diverse noise predicted for smooth image regions. As a consequence of this divergence, we present that the space of image inversions is notably less manipulative than the original Gaussian noise. Next, we explain the origin of the phenomenon, demonstrating that, during the first inversion steps, the noise prediction error is much more significant for the plain areas than for the rest of the image. As a surprisingly simple solution, we propose to replace the first DDIM Inversion steps with a forward diffusion process, which successfully decorrelates latent encodings, leading to higher quality editions and interpolations. The code is available at https://github.com/luk-st/taba.

Abstract: Advancements in image segmentation play an integral role within the broad scope of Deep Learning-based Computer Vision. Furthermore, their widespread applicability in critical real-world tasks has resulted in challenges related to the reliability of such algorithms. Hence, uncertainty quantification has been extensively studied within this context, enabling the expression of model ignorance (epistemic uncertainty) or data ambiguity (aleatoric uncertainty) to prevent uninformed decision-making. Due to the rapid adoption of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based segmentation models in high-stake applications, a substantial body of research has been published on this very topic, causing its swift expansion into a distinct field. This work provides a comprehensive overview of probabilistic segmentation, by discussing fundamental concepts of uncertainty quantification, governing advancements in the field as well as the application to various tasks. Moreover, literature on both types of uncertainties trace back to four key applications: (1) to quantify statistical inconsistencies in the annotation process due ambiguous images, (2) correlating prediction error with uncertainty, (3) expanding the model hypothesis space for better generalization, and (4) Active Learning. An extensive discussion follows that includes an overview of utilized datasets for each of the applications and evaluation of the available methods. We also highlight challenges related to architectures, uncertainty quantification methods, standardization and benchmarking, and finally end with recommendations for future work such as methods based on single forward passes and models that appropriately leverage volumetric data.

Abstract: The remarkable performance of large language models (LLMs) in content generation, coding, and common-sense reasoning has spurred widespread integration into many facets of society. However, integration of LLMs raises valid questions on their reliability and trustworthiness, given their propensity to generate hallucinations: plausible, factually-incorrect responses, which are expressed with striking confidence. Previous work has shown that hallucinations and other non-factual responses generated by LLMs can be detected by examining the uncertainty of the LLM in its response to the pertinent prompt, driving significant research efforts devoted to quantifying the uncertainty of LLMs. This survey seeks to provide an extensive review of existing uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs, identifying their salient features, along with their strengths and weaknesses. We present existing methods within a relevant taxonomy, unifying ostensibly disparate methods to aid understanding of the state of the art. Furthermore, we highlight applications of uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs, spanning chatbot and textual applications to embodied artificial intelligence applications in robotics. We conclude with open research challenges in uncertainty quantification of LLMs, seeking to motivate future research.

<title>Continual Learning with Strategic Selection and Forgetting for Network Intrusion Detection</title>

Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are crucial for safeguarding digital infrastructure. In dynamic network environments, both threat landscapes and normal operational behaviors are constantly changing, resulting in concept drift. While continuous learning mitigates the adverse effects of concept drift, insufficient attention to drift patterns and excessive preservation of outdated knowledge can still hinder the IDS's adaptability. In this paper, we propose SSF (Strategic Selection and Forgetting), a novel continual learning method for IDS, providing continuous model updates with a constantly refreshed memory buffer. Our approach features a strategic sample selection algorithm to select representative new samples and a strategic forgetting mechanism to drop outdated samples. The proposed strategic sample selection algorithm prioritizes new samples that cause the `drifted' pattern, enabling the model to better understand the evolving landscape. Additionally, we introduce strategic forgetting upon detecting significant drift by discarding outdated samples to free up memory, allowing the incorporation of more recent data. SSF captures evolving patterns effectively and ensures the model is aligned with the change of data patterns, significantly enhancing the IDS's adaptability to concept drift. The state-of-the-art performance of SSF on NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 datasets demonstrates its superior adaptability to concept drift for network intrusion detection. The code is released at https://github.com/xinchen930/SSF-Strategic-Selection-and-Forgetting.

<title>A Framework for Mining Collectively-Behaving Bots in MMORPGs</title>

Abstract: In MMORPGs (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games), abnormal players (bots) using unauthorized automated programs to carry out pre-defined behaviors systematically and repeatedly are commonly observed. Bots usually engage in these activities to gain in-game money, which they eventually trade for real money outside the game. Such abusive activities negatively impact the in-game experiences of legitimate users since bots monopolize specific hunting areas and obtain valuable items. Thus, detecting abnormal players is a significant task for game companies. Motivated by the fact that bots tend to behave collectively with similar in-game trajectories due to the auto-programs, we developed BotTRep, a framework that comprises trajectory representation learning followed by clustering using a completely unlabeled in-game trajectory dataset. Our model aims to learn representations for in-game trajectory sequences so that players with contextually similar trajectories have closer embeddings. Then, by applying DBSCAN to these representations and visualizing the corresponding moving patterns, our framework ultimately assists game masters in identifying and banning bots.

Abstract: Monitoring real-time air quality is essential for safeguarding public health and fostering social progress. However, the widespread deployment of air quality monitoring stations is constrained by their significant costs. To address this limitation, we introduce \emph{AirRadar}, a deep neural network designed to accurately infer real-time air quality in locations lacking monitoring stations by utilizing data from existing ones. By leveraging learnable mask tokens, AirRadar reconstructs air quality features in unmonitored regions. Specifically, it operates in two stages: first capturing spatial correlations and then adjusting for distribution shifts. We validate AirRadar's efficacy using a year-long dataset from 1,085 monitoring stations across China, demonstrating its superiority over multiple baselines, even with varying degrees of unobserved data. The source code can be accessed at https://github.com/CityMind-Lab/AirRadar.

<title>SKIL: Semantic Keypoint Imitation Learning for Generalizable Data-efficient Manipulation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14400</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2501.14400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world tasks such as garment manipulation and table rearrangement demand robots to perform generalizable, highly precise, and long-horizon actions. Although imitation learning has proven to be an effective approach for teaching robots new skills, large amounts of expert demonstration data are still indispensible for these complex tasks, resulting in high sample complexity and costly data collection. To address this, we propose Semantic Keypoint Imitation Learning (SKIL), a framework which automatically obtains semantic keypoints with the help of vision foundation models, and forms the descriptor of semantic keypoints that enables efficient imitation learning of complex robotic tasks with significantly lower sample complexity. In real-world experiments, SKIL doubles the performance of baseline methods in tasks such as picking a cup or mouse, while demonstrating exceptional robustness to variations in objects, environmental changes, and distractors. For long-horizon tasks like hanging a towel on a rack where previous methods fail completely, SKIL achieves a mean success rate of 70\% with as few as 30 demonstrations. Furthermore, SKIL naturally supports cross-embodiment learning due to its semantic keypoints abstraction. Our experiments demonstrate that even human videos bring considerable improvement to the learning performance. All these results demonstrate the great success of SKIL in achieving data-efficient generalizable robotic learning. Visualizations and code are available at: https://skil-robotics.github.io/SKIL-robotics/.

Abstract: Image watermarks have been considered a promising technique to help detect AI-generated content, which can be used to protect copyright or prevent fake image abuse. In this work, we present a black-box method for removing invisible image watermarks, without the need of any dataset of watermarked images or any knowledge about the watermark system. Our approach is simple to implement: given a single watermarked image, we regress it by deep image prior (DIP). We show that from the intermediate steps of DIP one can reliably find an evasion image that can remove invisible watermarks while preserving high image quality. Due to its unique working mechanism and practical effectiveness, we advocate including DIP as a baseline invasion method for benchmarking the robustness of watermarking systems. Finally, by showing the limited ability of DIP and other existing black-box methods in evading training-based visible watermarks, we discuss the positive implications on the practical use of training-based visible watermarks to prevent misinformation abuse.

<title>Distribution Matching for Self-Supervised Transfer Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2502.14424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised transfer learning method called \underline{\textbf{D}}istribution \underline{\textbf{M}}atching (DM), which drives the representation distribution toward a predefined reference distribution while preserving augmentation invariance. DM results in a learned representation space that is intuitively structured and therefore easy to interpret.
  Experimental results across multiple real-world datasets and evaluation metrics demonstrate that DM performs competitively on target classification tasks compared to existing self-supervised transfer learning methods. Additionally, we provide robust theoretical guarantees for DM, including a population theorem and an end-to-end sample theorem. The population theorem bridges the gap between the self-supervised learning task and target classification accuracy, while the sample theorem shows that, even with a limited number of samples from the target domain, DM can deliver exceptional classification performance, provided the unlabeled sample size is sufficiently large.

arXiv:2503.00032v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) increases the difficulty of distinguishing between human-written and LLM-generated text. Detecting LLM-generated text is crucial for upholding academic integrity, preventing plagiarism, protecting copyrights, and ensuring ethical research practices. Most prior studies on detecting LLM-generated text focus primarily on English text. However, languages with distinct morphological and syntactic characteristics require specialized detection approaches. Their unique structures and usage patterns can hinder the direct application of methods primarily designed for English. Among such languages, we focus on Korean, which has relatively flexible spacing rules, a rich morphological system, and less frequent comma usage compared to English. We introduce KatFish, the first benchmark dataset for detecting LLM-generated Korean text. The dataset consists of text written by humans and generated by four LLMs across three genres.
  By examining spacing patterns, part-of-speech diversity, and comma usage, we illuminate the linguistic differences between human-written and LLM-generated Korean text. Building on these observations, we propose KatFishNet, a detection method specifically designed for the Korean language. KatFishNet achieves an average of 19.78% higher AUROC compared to the best-performing existing detection method. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Shinwoo-Park/detecting_llm_generated_korean_text_through_linguistic_analysis.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven immensely beneficial in education by capturing vast amounts of literature-based information, allowing them to generate context without relying on external sources. In this paper, we propose a generative AI-powered GATE question-answering framework (GATE stands for Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering) that leverages LLMs to explain GATE solutions and support students in their exam preparation. We conducted extensive benchmarking to select the optimal embedding model and LLM, evaluating our framework based on criteria such as latency, faithfulness, and relevance, with additional validation through human evaluation. Our chatbot integrates state-of-the-art embedding models and LLMs to deliver accurate, context-aware responses. Through rigorous experimentation, we identified configurations that balance performance and computational efficiency, ensuring a reliable chatbot to serve students' needs. Additionally, we discuss the challenges faced in data processing and modeling and implemented solutions. Our work explores the application of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for GATE Q/A explanation tasks, and our findings demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and response quality. This research offers practical insights for developing effective AI-driven educational tools while highlighting areas for future enhancement in usability and scalability.

Abstract: While internet-scale image and textual data have enabled strong generalization in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), the absence of internet-scale control data has impeded the development of similar generalization in standard reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Although VLMs are fundamentally limited in their ability to solve control tasks due to their lack of action-conditioned training data, their capacity for image understanding allows them to provide valuable feedback in RL tasks by recognizing successful outcomes. A key challenge in Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) is determining how best to integrate VLM-derived signals into the learning process. We explore this question in the context of offline RL and introduce a class of methods called sub-trajectory filtered optimization. We identify three key insights. First, trajectory length plays a crucial role in offline RL, as full-trajectory preference learning exacerbates the stitching problem, necessitating the use of sub-trajectories. Second, even in Markovian environments, a non-Markovian reward signal from a sequence of images is required to assess trajectory improvement, as VLMs do not interpret control actions and must rely on visual cues over time. Third, a simple yet effective approach--filtered and weighted behavior cloning--consistently outperforms more complex reinforcement learning from human feedback-based methods. We propose sub-trajectory filtered behavior cloning, a method that leverages VLM feedback on sub-trajectories while incorporating a retrospective filtering mechanism that removes sub-trajectories preceding failures to improve robustness and prevent turbulence. This study is preliminary; we provide initial evidence through evaluations on a toy control domain. Please enjoy our airport puns.

<title>How Metacognitive Architectures Remember Their Own Thoughts: A Systematic Review</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13467</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13467</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2503.13467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Metacognition has gained significant attention for its potential to enhance autonomy and adaptability of artificial agents but remains a fragmented field: diverse theories, terminologies, and design choices have led to disjointed developments and limited comparability across systems. Existing overviews remain at a conceptual level that is undiscerning to the underlying algorithms, representations, and their respective success.
  Methods: We address this gap by performing an explorative systematic review. Reports were included if they described techniques enabling Computational Metacognitive Architectures (CMAs) to model, store, remember, and process their episodic metacognitive experiences, one of Flavell's (1979a) three foundational components of metacognition. Searches were conducted in 16 databases, consulted between December 2023 and June 2024. Data were extracted using a 20-item framework considering pertinent aspects.
  Results: A total of 101 reports on 35 distinct CMAs were included. Our findings show that metacognitive experiences may boost system performance and explainability, e.g., via self-repair. However, lack of standardization and limited evaluations may hinder progress: only 17% of CMAs were quantitatively evaluated regarding this review's focus, and significant terminological inconsistency limits cross-architecture synthesis. Systems also varied widely in memory content, data types, and employed algorithms.
  Discussion: Limitations include the non-iterative nature of the search query, heterogeneous data availability, and an under-representation of emergent, sub-symbolic CMAs. Future research should focus on standardization and evaluation, e.g., via community-driven challenges, and on transferring promising principles to emergent architectures.

Abstract: We present Concat-ID, a unified framework for identity-preserving video generation. Concat-ID employs variational autoencoders to extract image features, which are then concatenated with video latents along the sequence dimension. It relies exclusively on inherent 3D self-attention mechanisms to incorporate them, eliminating the need for additional parameters or modules. A novel cross-video pairing strategy and a multi-stage training regimen are introduced to balance identity consistency and facial editability while enhancing video naturalness. Extensive experiments demonstrate Concat-ID's superiority over existing methods in both single and multi-identity generation, as well as its seamless scalability to multi-subject scenarios, including virtual try-on and background-controllable generation. Concat-ID establishes a new benchmark for identity-preserving video synthesis, providing a versatile and scalable solution for a wide range of applications.

arXiv:2504.03597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce real-is-sim, a new approach to integrating simulation into behavior cloning pipelines. In contrast to real-only methods, which lack the ability to safely test policies before deployment, and sim-to-real methods, which require complex adaptation to cross the sim-to-real gap, our framework allows policies to seamlessly switch between running on real hardware and running in parallelized virtual environments. At the center of real-is-sim is a dynamic digital twin, powered by the Embodied Gaussian simulator, that synchronizes with the real world at 60Hz. This twin acts as a mediator between the behavior cloning policy and the real robot. Policies are trained using representations derived from simulator states and always act on the simulated robot, never the real one. During deployment, the real robot simply follows the simulated robot's joint states, and the simulation is continuously corrected with real world measurements. This setup, where the simulator drives all policy execution and maintains real-time synchronization with the physical world, shifts the responsibility of crossing the sim-to-real gap to the digital twin's synchronization mechanisms, instead of the policy itself. We demonstrate real-is-sim on a long-horizon manipulation task (PushT), showing that virtual evaluations are consistent with real-world results. We further show how real-world data can be augmented with virtual rollouts and compare to policies trained on different representations derived from the simulator state including object poses and rendered images from both static and robot-mounted cameras. Our results highlight the flexibility of the real-is-sim framework across training, evaluation, and deployment stages. Videos available at https://real-is-sim.github.io.

<title>Recursive Training Loops in LLMs: How training data properties modulate distribution shift in generated data?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.03814v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in the creation of online content, creating feedback loops as subsequent generations of models will be trained on this synthetic data. Such loops were shown to lead to distribution shifts - models misrepresenting the true underlying distributions of human data (also called model collapse). However, how human data properties affect such shifts remains poorly understood. In this paper, we provide the first empirical examination of the effect of such properties on the outcome of recursive training. We first confirm that using different human datasets leads to distribution shifts of different magnitudes. Through exhaustive manipulation of dataset properties combined with regression analyses, we then identify a set of properties predicting distribution shift magnitudes. Lexical diversity is found to amplify these shifts, while semantic diversity and data quality mitigate them. Furthermore, we find that these influences are highly modular: data scrapped from a given internet domain has little influence on the content generated for another domain. Finally, experiments on political bias reveal that human data properties affect whether the initial bias will be amplified or reduced. Overall, our results portray a novel view, where different parts of internet may undergo different types of distribution shift.

Abstract: This paper introduces Timestep-Adaptive Representation Alignment with Onset-Aware Conditioning (TARO), a novel framework for high-fidelity and temporally coherent video-to-audio synthesis. Built upon flow-based transformers, which offer stable training and continuous transformations for enhanced synchronization and audio quality, TARO introduces two key innovations: (1) Timestep-Adaptive Representation Alignment (TRA), which dynamically aligns latent representations by adjusting alignment strength based on the noise schedule, ensuring smooth evolution and improved fidelity, and (2) Onset-Aware Conditioning (OAC), which integrates onset cues that serve as sharp event-driven markers of audio-relevant visual moments to enhance synchronization with dynamic visual events. Extensive experiments on the VGGSound and Landscape datasets demonstrate that TARO outperforms prior methods, achieving relatively 53% lower Frechet Distance (FD), 29% lower Frechet Audio Distance (FAD), and a 97.19% Alignment Accuracy, highlighting its superior audio quality and synchronization precision.

Abstract: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is the gold standard for non-invasive cardiac assessment, offering rich spatio-temporal views of the cardiac anatomy and physiology. Patient-level health factors, such as demographics, metabolic, and lifestyle, are known to substantially influence cardiovascular health and disease risk, yet remain uncaptured by CMR alone. To holistically understand cardiac health and to enable the best possible interpretation of an individual's disease risk, CMR and patient-level factors must be jointly exploited within an integrated framework. Recent multi-modal approaches have begun to bridge this gap, yet they often rely on limited spatio-temporal data and focus on isolated clinical tasks, thereby hindering the development of a comprehensive representation for cardiac health evaluation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ViTa, a step toward foundation models that delivers a comprehensive representation of the heart and a precise interpretation of individual disease risk. Leveraging data from 42,000 UK Biobank participants, ViTa integrates 3D+T cine stacks from short-axis and long-axis views, enabling a complete capture of the cardiac cycle. These imaging data are then fused with detailed tabular patient-level factors, enabling context-aware insights. This multi-modal paradigm supports a wide spectrum of downstream tasks, including cardiac phenotype and physiological feature prediction, segmentation, and classification of cardiac and metabolic diseases within a single unified framework. By learning a shared latent representation that bridges rich imaging features and patient context, ViTa moves beyond traditional, task-specific models toward a universal, patient-specific understanding of cardiac health, highlighting its potential to advance clinical utility and scalability in cardiac analysis.

arXiv:2504.20131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the LZ penalty, a penalty specialized for reducing degenerate repetitions in autoregressive language models without loss of capability. The penalty is based on the codelengths in the LZ77 universal lossless compression algorithm. Through the lens of the prediction-compression duality, decoding the LZ penalty has the interpretation of sampling from the residual distribution after removing the information that is highly compressible. We demonstrate the LZ penalty enables state-of-the-art open-source reasoning models to operate with greedy (temperature zero) decoding without loss of capability and without instances of degenerate repetition. Both the industry-standard frequency penalty and repetition penalty are ineffective, incurring degenerate repetition rates of up to 4%.

Abstract: Achieving deep alignment between vision and language remains a central challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). These models often fail to fully leverage visual input, defaulting to strong language priors. Our approach first provides insights into how MLLMs internally build visual understanding of image regions and then introduces techniques to amplify this capability. Specifically, we explore techniques designed both to deepen the model's understanding of visual content and to ensure that these visual insights actively guide language generation. We demonstrate the superior multimodal understanding of our resultant model through a detailed upstream analysis quantifying its ability to predict visually-dependent tokens as well as 10 pt boost on visually challenging tasks.

Abstract: In the era of big data, data mining has become indispensable for uncovering hidden patterns and insights from vast and complex datasets. The integration of multimodal data sources further enhances its potential. Multimodal Federated Learning (MFL) is a distributed approach that enhances the efficiency and quality of multimodal learning, ensuring collaborative work and privacy protection. However, missing modalities pose a significant challenge in MFL, often due to data quality issues or privacy policies across the clients. In this work, we present MMiC, a framework for Mitigating Modality incompleteness in MFL within the Clusters. MMiC replaces partial parameters within client models inside clusters to mitigate the impact of missing modalities. Furthermore, it leverages the Banzhaf Power Index to optimize client selection under these conditions. Finally, MMiC employs an innovative approach to dynamically control global aggregation by utilizing Markovitz Portfolio Optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MMiC consistently outperforms existing federated learning architectures in both global and personalized performance on multimodal datasets with missing modalities, confirming the effectiveness of our proposed solution.

This evolving intelligent assistant platform is equipped with chatbots and AI agents to help experts and guide non-experts in setting up and running the atomistic simulations, monitoring their computation status, analyzing the simulation results, and summarizing them for the user in text and graphical forms. We achieve these goals by exploiting open-source large language models (LLMs, original and fine-tuned), rule-based agents, and a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system. Aitomia leverages the versatility of our MLatom ecosystem, supporting AI-enhanced computational chemistry tasks ranging from ground- to excited-state calculations such as geometry optimizations, thermochemistry, and spectra calculations. Aitomia is the first intelligent assistant publicly accessible online on a cloud computing platform for atomistic simulations of broad scope (Aitomistic Hub at https://aitomistic.xyz), while it may also be deployed locally as described at http://mlatom.com/aitomia. Aitomia is expected to lower the barrier to performing atomistic simulations, democratizing simulations, and accelerating research and development in the relevant fields.

Abstract: The Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) is a linguistic theory based on a universal set of semantic primes: simple, primitive word-meanings that have been shown to exist in most, if not all, languages of the world. According to this framework, any word, regardless of complexity, can be paraphrased using these primes, revealing a clear and universally translatable meaning. These paraphrases, known as explications, can offer valuable applications for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, but producing them has traditionally been a slow, manual process. In this work, we present the first study of using large language models (LLMs) to generate NSM explications. We introduce automatic evaluation methods, a tailored dataset for training and evaluation, and fine-tuned models for this task. Our 1B and 8B models outperform GPT-4o in producing accurate, cross-translatable explications, marking a significant step toward universal semantic representation with LLMs and opening up new possibilities for applications in semantic analysis, translation, and beyond.

Abstract: Neural language models are black-boxes -- both linguistic patterns and factual knowledge are distributed across billions of opaque parameters. This entangled encoding makes it difficult to reliably inspect, verify, or update specific facts. We propose a new class of language models, Large Memory Language Models (LMLM) with a pre-training recipe that stores factual knowledge in both internal weights and an external database. Our approach strategically masks externally retrieved factual values from the training loss, thereby teaching the model to perform targeted lookups rather than relying on memorization in model weights. Our experiments demonstrate that LMLMs achieve competitive performance compared to significantly larger, knowledge-dense LLMs on standard benchmarks, while offering the advantages of explicit, editable, and verifiable knowledge bases. This work represents a fundamental shift in how language models interact with and manage factual knowledge.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), like recent Mamba2, have achieved remarkable performance and received extensive attention. However, deploying Mamba2 on resource-constrained edge devices encounters many problems: severe outliers within the linear layer challenging the quantization, diverse and irregular element-wise tensor operations, and hardware-unfriendly nonlinear functions in the SSM block. To address these issues, this paper presents FastMamba, a dedicated accelerator on FPGA with hardware-algorithm co-design to promote the deployment efficiency of Mamba2. Specifically, we successfully achieve 8-bit quantization for linear layers through Hadamard transformation to eliminate outliers. Moreover, a hardware-friendly and fine-grained power-of-two quantization framework is presented for the SSM block and convolution layer, and a first-order linear approximation is developed to optimize the nonlinear functions. Based on the accurate algorithm quantization, we propose an accelerator that integrates parallel vector processing units, pipelined execution dataflow, and an efficient SSM Nonlinear Approximation Unit, which enhances computational efficiency and reduces hardware complexity. Finally, we evaluate FastMamba on Xilinx VC709 FPGA. For the input prefill task on Mamba2-130M, FastMamba achieves 68.80\times and 8.90\times speedup over Intel Xeon 4210R CPU and NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU, respectively. In the output decode experiment with Mamba2-2.7B, FastMamba attains 6\times higher energy efficiency than RTX 3090 GPU.

<title>Self-reflective Uncertainties: Do LLMs Know Their Internal Answer Distribution?</title>

Abstract: To reveal when a large language model (LLM) is uncertain about a response, uncertainty quantification commonly produces percentage numbers along with the output. But is this all we can do? We argue that in the output space of LLMs, the space of strings, exist strings expressive enough to summarize the distribution over output strings the LLM deems possible. We lay a foundation for this new avenue of uncertainty explication and present SelfReflect, a theoretically-motivated metric to assess how faithfully a string summarizes an LLM's internal answer distribution. We show that SelfReflect is able to discriminate even subtle differences of candidate summary strings and that it aligns with human judgement, outperforming alternative metrics such as LLM judges and embedding comparisons. With SelfReflect, we investigate a number of self-summarization methods and find that even state-of-the-art reasoning models struggle to explicate their internal uncertainty. But we find that faithful summarizations can be generated by sampling and summarizing. To support the development of this universal form of LLM uncertainties, we publish our metric at https://github.com/apple/ml-selfreflect

Abstract: We present LrcSSM, a $\textit{nonlinear}$ recurrent model that processes long sequences as fast as today's linear state-space layers. By forcing the state-transition matrix to be diagonal and learned at every step, the full sequence can be solved in parallel with a single prefix-scan, giving $\mathcal{O}(TD)$ time and memory and only $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ sequential depth, for input-sequence length $T$ and a state dimension $D$. Moreover, LrcSSM offers a formal gradient-stability guarantee that other input-varying systems such as Liquid-S4 and Mamba do not provide. Lastly, for network depth $L$, as the forward and backward passes cost $\Theta(T\,D\,L)$ FLOPs, with its low sequential depth and parameter count $\Theta(D\,L)$, the model follows the compute-optimal scaling law regime ($\beta \approx 0.42$) recently observed for Mamba, outperforming quadratic-attention Transformers at equal compute while avoiding the memory overhead of FFT-based long convolutions. We show that on a series of long-range forecasting tasks, LrcSSM outperforms LRU, S5 and Mamba.

Abstract: This work addresses mechanical defocus in Earth observation images from the IMAGIN-e mission aboard the ISS, proposing a blind deblurring approach adapted to space-based edge computing constraints. Leveraging Sentinel-2 data, our method estimates the defocus kernel and trains a restoration model within a GAN framework, effectively operating without reference images.
  On Sentinel-2 images with synthetic degradation, SSIM improved by 72.47% and PSNR by 25.00%, confirming the model's ability to recover lost details when the original clean image is known. On IMAGIN-e, where no reference images exist, perceptual quality metrics indicate a substantial enhancement, with NIQE improving by 60.66% and BRISQUE by 48.38%, validating real-world onboard restoration. The approach is currently deployed aboard the IMAGIN-e mission, demonstrating its practical application in an operational space environment.
  By efficiently handling high-resolution images under edge computing constraints, the method enables applications such as water body segmentation and contour detection while maintaining processing viability despite resource limitations.

<title>Adapting Rule Representation With Four-Parameter Beta Distribution for Learning Classifier Systems</title>

Abstract: Rule representations significantly influence the search capabilities and decision boundaries within the search space of Learning Classifier Systems (LCSs), a family of rule-based machine learning systems that evolve interpretable models through evolutionary processes. However, it is very difficult to choose an appropriate rule representation for each problem. Additionally, some problems benefit from using different representations for different subspaces within the input space. Thus, an adaptive mechanism is needed to choose an appropriate rule representation for each rule in LCSs. This article introduces a flexible rule representation using a four-parameter beta distribution and integrates it into a fuzzy-style LCS. The four-parameter beta distribution can form various function shapes, and this flexibility enables our LCS to automatically select appropriate representations for different subspaces. Our rule representation can represent crisp/fuzzy decision boundaries in various boundary shapes, such as rectangles and bells, by controlling four parameters, compared to the standard representations such as trapezoidal ones. Leveraging this flexibility, our LCS is designed to adapt the appropriate rule representation for each subspace. Moreover, our LCS incorporates a generalization bias favoring crisp rules where feasible, enhancing model interpretability without compromising accuracy. Experimental results on real-world classification tasks show that our LCS achieves significantly superior test accuracy and produces more compact rule sets. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/YNU-NakataLab/Beta4-UCS. An extended abstract related to this work is available at https://doi.org/10.36227/techrxiv.174900805.59801248/v1.

<title>On the Fundamental Impossibility of Hallucination Control in Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06382</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.06382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that perfect hallucination control in large language models is mathematically impossible. No LLM inference mechanism can simultaneously achieve truthful response generation, semantic information conservation, relevant knowledge revelation, and knowledge-constrained optimality. This impossibility is fundamental, arising from the mathematical structure of information aggregation itself rather than engineering limitations. The proof spans three mathematical frameworks: auction theory, proper scoring theory for probabilistic predictions, and log-sum-exp analysis for transformer architectures. In each setting, we demonstrate that information aggregation creates unavoidable violations of conservation principles. The Jensen gap in transformer probability aggregation provides a direct measure of this impossibility. These results reframe hallucination from an engineering bug to an inevitable mathematical feature of distributed intelligence. There are fundamental trade-offs between truthfulness, knowledge utilization, and response completeness, providing principled foundations for managing rather than eliminating hallucination. This work reveals deep connections between neural network inference, philosophy of knowledge and reasoning, and classical results in game theory and information theory, opening new research directions for developing beneficial AI systems within mathematical constraints.

Abstract: We present BIS Reasoning 1.0, the first large-scale Japanese dataset of syllogistic reasoning problems explicitly designed to evaluate belief-inconsistent reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior datasets such as NeuBAROCO and JFLD, which focus on general or belief-aligned reasoning, BIS Reasoning 1.0 introduces logically valid yet belief-inconsistent syllogisms to uncover reasoning biases in LLMs trained on human-aligned corpora. We benchmark state-of-the-art models - including GPT models, Claude models, and leading Japanese LLMs - revealing significant variance in performance, with GPT-4o achieving 79.54% accuracy. Our analysis identifies critical weaknesses in current LLMs when handling logically valid but belief-conflicting inputs. These findings have important implications for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains such as law, healthcare, and scientific literature, where truth must override intuitive belief to ensure integrity and safety.

Abstract: Time series classification is a fundamental task in healthcare and industry, yet the development of time series foundation models (TSFMs) remains limited by the scarcity of publicly available time series datasets. In this work, we propose Time Vision Transformer (TiViT), a framework that converts time series into images to leverage the representational power of frozen Vision Transformers (ViTs) pretrained on large-scale image datasets. First, we theoretically motivate our approach by analyzing the 2D patching of ViTs for time series, showing that it can increase the number of label-relevant tokens and reduce the sample complexity. Second, we empirically demonstrate that TiViT achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard time series classification benchmarks by utilizing the hidden representations of large OpenCLIP models. We explore the structure of TiViT representations and find that intermediate layers with high intrinsic dimension are the most effective for time series classification. Finally, we assess the alignment between TiViT and TSFM representation spaces and identify a strong complementarity, with further performance gains achieved by combining their features. Our findings reveal a new direction for reusing vision representations in a non-visual domain. Code is available at https://github.com/ExplainableML/TiViT.

Abstract: In this letter, we present tightly coupled LiDAR-IMU-leg odometry, which is robust to challenging conditions such as featureless environments and deformable terrains. We developed an online learning-based leg kinematics model named the neural leg kinematics model, which incorporates tactile information (foot reaction force) to implicitly express the nonlinear dynamics between robot feet and the ground. Online training of this model enhances its adaptability to weight load changes of a robot (e.g., assuming delivery or transportation tasks) and terrain conditions. According to the \textit{neural adaptive leg odometry factor} and online uncertainty estimation of the leg kinematics model-based motion predictions, we jointly solve online training of this kinematics model and odometry estimation on a unified factor graph to retain the consistency of both. The proposed method was verified through real experiments using a quadruped robot in two challenging situations: 1) a sandy beach, representing an extremely featureless area with a deformable terrain, and 2) a campus, including multiple featureless areas and terrain types of asphalt, gravel (deformable terrain), and grass. Experimental results showed that our odometry estimation incorporating the \textit{neural leg kinematics model} outperforms state-of-the-art works.

arXiv:2506.13205v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the growing integration of vision-language models (VLMs), mobile agents are now widely used for tasks like UI automation and camera-based user assistance. These agents are often fine-tuned on limited user-generated datasets, leaving them vulnerable to covert threats during the training process. In this work we present GHOST, the first clean-label backdoor attack specifically designed for mobile agents built upon VLMs. Our method manipulates only the visual inputs of a portion of the training samples - without altering their corresponding labels or instructions - thereby injecting malicious behaviors into the model. Once fine-tuned with this tampered data, the agent will exhibit attacker-controlled responses when a specific visual trigger is introduced at inference time. The core of our approach lies in aligning the gradients of poisoned samples with those of a chosen target instance, embedding backdoor-relevant features into the poisoned training data. To maintain stealth and enhance robustness, we develop three realistic visual triggers: static visual patches, dynamic motion cues, and subtle low-opacity overlays. We evaluate our method across six real-world Android apps and three VLM architectures adapted for mobile use. Results show that our attack achieves high attack success rates (up to 94.67 percent) while maintaining high clean-task performance (FSR up to 95.85 percent). Additionally, ablation studies shed light on how various design choices affect the efficacy and concealment of the attack. Overall, this work is the first to expose critical security flaws in VLM-based mobile agents, highlighting their susceptibility to clean-label backdoor attacks and the urgent need for effective defense mechanisms in their training pipelines.

<title>GraphGSOcc: Semantic-Geometric Graph Transformer with Dynamic-Static Decoupling for 3D Gaussian Splatting-based Occupancy Prediction</title>

arXiv:2506.14825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Addressing the task of 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous driving, we tackle two key issues in existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods: (1) unified feature aggregation neglecting semantic correlations among similar categories and across regions, (2) boundary ambiguities caused by the lack of geometric constraints in MLP iterative optimization and (3) biased issues in dynamic-static object coupling optimization. We propose the GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph Transformer and decouples dynamic-static objects optimization for 3D Gaussian Splatting-based Occupancy Prediction. We propose the Dual Gaussians Graph Attenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph structures: a geometric graph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on Gaussian poses, enabling large-scale Gaussians to aggregate features from broader neighborhoods while compact Gaussians focus on local geometric consistency; a semantic graph retaining top-M highly correlated nodes via cosine similarity to explicitly encode semantic relationships within and across instances. Coupled with the Multi-scale Graph Attention framework, fine-grained attention at lower layers optimizes boundary details, while coarsegrained attention at higher layers models object-level topology. On the other hand, we decouple dynamic and static objects by leveraging semantic probability distributions and design a Dynamic-Static Decoupled Gaussian Attention mechanism to optimize the prediction performance for both dynamic objects and static scenes. GraphGSOcc achieves state-ofthe-art performance on the SurroundOcc-nuScenes, Occ3D-nuScenes, OpenOcc and KITTI occupancy benchmarks. Experiments on the SurroundOcc dataset achieve an mIoU of 25.20%, reducing GPU memory to 6.8 GB, demonstrating a 1.97% mIoU improvement and 13.7% memory reduction compared to GaussianWorld.

Abstract: We propose a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) framework aimed at ensuring fair outcomes across agents while maximizing overall system performance. A key challenge in this setting is decision-making under limited information about arm rewards. To address this, we introduce a novel probing framework that strategically gathers information about selected arms before allocation. In the offline setting, where reward distributions are known, we leverage submodular properties to design a greedy probing algorithm with a provable performance bound. For the more complex online setting, we develop an algorithm that achieves sublinear regret while maintaining fairness. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms baseline methods, achieving better fairness and efficiency.

arXiv:2506.17352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the importance of rigorous safety evaluation is becoming increasingly evident. Recent concerns within the realm of safety assessment have highlighted instances in which LLMs exhibit behaviors that appear to disable oversight mechanisms and respond in a deceptive manner. For example, there have been reports suggesting that, when confronted with information unfavorable to their own persistence during task execution, LLMs may act covertly and even provide false answers to questions intended to verify their behavior. To evaluate the potential risk of such deceptive actions toward developers or users, it is essential to investigate whether these behaviors stem from covert, intentional processes within the model. In this study, we propose that it is necessary to measure the theory of mind capabilities of LLMs. We begin by reviewing existing research on theory of mind and identifying the perspectives and tasks relevant to its application in safety evaluation. Given that theory of mind has been predominantly studied within the context of developmental psychology, we analyze developmental trends across a series of open-weight LLMs. Our results indicate that while LLMs have improved in reading comprehension, their theory of mind capabilities have not shown comparable development. Finally, we present the current state of safety evaluation with respect to LLMs' theory of mind, and discuss remaining challenges for future work.

<title>TRACED: Transition-aware Regret Approximation with Co-learnability for Environment Design</title>

Abstract: Generalizing deep reinforcement learning agents to unseen environments remains a significant challenge. One promising solution is Unsupervised Environment Design (UED), a co-evolutionary framework in which a teacher adaptively generates tasks with high learning potential, while a student learns a robust policy from this evolving curriculum. Existing UED methods typically measure learning potential via regret, the gap between optimal and current performance, approximated solely by value-function loss. Building on these approaches, we introduce the transition prediction error as an additional term in our regret approximation. To capture how training on one task affects performance on others, we further propose a lightweight metric called co-learnability. By combining these two measures, we present Transition-aware Regret Approximation with Co-learnability for Environment Design (TRACED). Empirical evaluations show that TRACED yields curricula that improve zero-shot generalization across multiple benchmarks while requiring up to 2x fewer environment interactions than strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that the transition prediction error drives rapid complexity ramp-up and that co-learnability delivers additional gains when paired with the transition prediction error. These results demonstrate how refined regret approximation and explicit modeling of task relationships can be leveraged for sample-efficient curriculum design in UED.

<div> privacy, large language models, encrypted search, user data, hybrid framework

Summary:
The article introduces a novel approach to utilizing large language models (LLMs) while maintaining user privacy. By employing a technique called Socratic Chain-of-Thought Reasoning, a generic user query is first sent to a powerful, untrusted LLM to generate prompts and sub-queries without accessing sensitive user data. These sub-queries are then encrypted and searched across a large dataset of private user information using a Homomorphically Encrypted Vector Database. The final response is generated by a local language model, combining the strengths of both the untrusted LLM and the local model. This hybrid framework, tested on the LoCoMo long-context QA benchmark, outperformed using the powerful LLM alone. By decomposing tasks between the untrusted LLM and the local model, this system showcases a step towards preserving user privacy while benefiting from the capabilities of advanced language models.

arXiv:2506.17336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as personal agents, accessing sensitive user data such as calendars, emails, and medical records. Users currently face a trade-off: They can send private records, many of which are stored in remote databases, to powerful but untrusted LLM providers, increasing their exposure risk. Alternatively, they can run less powerful models locally on trusted devices. We bridge this gap. Our Socratic Chain-of-Thought Reasoning first sends a generic, non-private user query to a powerful, untrusted LLM, which generates a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt and detailed sub-queries without accessing user data. Next, we embed these sub-queries and perform encrypted sub-second semantic search using our Homomorphically Encrypted Vector Database across one million entries of a single user's private data. This represents a realistic scale of personal documents, emails, and records accumulated over years of digital activity. Finally, we feed the CoT prompt and the decrypted records to a local language model and generate the final response. On the LoCoMo long-context QA benchmark, our hybrid framework, combining GPT-4o with a local Llama-3.2-1B model, outperforms using GPT-4o alone by up to 7.1 percentage points. This demonstrates a first step toward systems where tasks are decomposed and split between untrusted strong LLMs and weak local ones, preserving user privacy.

Abstract: We introduce a neural network approach for generating and customizing the trajectory of a robotic arm, that guarantees precision and repeatability. To highlight the potential of this novel method, we describe the design and implementation of the technique and show its application in an experimental setting of cognitive robotics. In this scenario, the NICO robot was characterized by the ability to point to specific points in space with precise linear movements, increasing the predictability of the robotic action during its interaction with humans. To achieve this goal, the neural network computes the forward kinematics of the robot arm. By integrating it with a generator of joint angles, another neural network was developed and trained on an artificial dataset created from suitable start and end poses of the robotic arm. Through the computation of angular velocities, the robot was characterized by its ability to perform the movement, and the quality of its action was evaluated in terms of shape and accuracy. Thanks to its broad applicability, our approach successfully generates precise trajectories that could be customized in their shape and adapted to different settings.

Summary:  
DiMo-GUI is a framework for grounding natural language queries in GUIs that incorporates dynamic visual grounding and modality-aware optimization. It splits the input into textual and iconic elements, allowing independent reasoning using vision-language models. The method dynamically focuses attention by generating candidate focal regions and incrementally zooming in to refine results when predictions are ambiguous. This hierarchical refinement process helps disambiguate visually cluttered layouts without additional training. Evaluation on standard GUI grounding benchmarks shows consistent improvements over baseline pipelines, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining modality separation with region-focused reasoning. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Grounding natural language queries in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) poses unique challenges due to the diversity of visual elements, spatial clutter, and the ambiguity of language. In this paper, we introduce DiMo-GUI, a training-free framework for GUI grounding that leverages two core strategies: dynamic visual grounding and modality-aware optimization. Instead of treating the GUI as a monolithic image, our method splits the input into textual elements and iconic elements, allowing the model to reason over each modality independently using general-purpose vision-language models. When predictions are ambiguous or incorrect, DiMo-GUI dynamically focuses attention by generating candidate focal regions centered on the model's initial predictions and incrementally zooms into subregions to refine the grounding result. This hierarchical refinement process helps disambiguate visually crowded layouts without the need for additional training or annotations. We evaluate our approach on standard GUI grounding benchmarks and demonstrate consistent improvements over baseline inference pipelines, highlighting the effectiveness of combining modality separation with region-focused reasoning.

This framework preserves both structural and semantic dimensions of tabular data through multimodal reasoning. Experimental evaluation demonstrates TalentMine's superior performance in query answering tasks compared to standard extraction methods. The study also identifies the Claude v3 Haiku model as optimal for talent management applications.

arXiv:2507.00041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In talent management systems, critical information often resides in complex tabular formats, presenting significant retrieval challenges for conventional language models. These challenges are pronounced when processing Talent documentation that requires precise interpretation of tabular relationships for accurate information retrieval and downstream decision-making. Current table extraction methods struggle with semantic understanding, resulting in poor performance when integrated into retrieval-augmented chat applications. This paper identifies a key bottleneck - while structural table information can be extracted, the semantic relationships between tabular elements are lost, causing downstream query failures. To address this, we introduce TalentMine, a novel LLM-enhanced framework that transforms extracted tables into semantically enriched representations. Unlike conventional approaches relying on CSV or text linearization, our method employs specialized multimodal reasoning to preserve both structural and semantic dimensions of tabular data. Experimental evaluation across employee benefits document collections demonstrates TalentMine's superior performance, achieving 100% accuracy in query answering tasks compared to 0% for standard AWS Textract extraction and 40% for AWS Textract Visual Q&amp;A capabilities. Our comparative analysis also reveals that the Claude v3 Haiku model achieves optimal performance for talent management applications. The key contributions of this work include (1) a systematic analysis of semantic information loss in current table extraction pipelines, (2) a novel LLM-based method for semantically enriched table representation, (3) an efficient integration framework for retrieval-augmented systems as end-to-end systems, and (4) comprehensive benchmarks on talent analytics tasks showing substantial improvements across multiple categories.

Summary: 
The article discusses the integration of machine learning in self-driving laboratories (SDL) to enhance discovery processes in scientific and engineering fields. By utilizing FAIR data infrastructure, distributed SDLs can collaborate effectively by sharing experimental data in a centralized database. Researchers contribute raw data to a shared platform, which is then processed using machine learning models and analysis tools. A nanoHUB workflow facilitates sequential optimization through active learning, enabling researchers to define objectives and train ML models in real-time for future experiment selection. The optimization task, inspired by the idea of a "frugal twin," involves finding the optimal combination of food dyes to achieve a target color. The framework allows for easy setup of experiments, data sharing, and exploration of predictive ML models, making it accessible to researchers and students. The tools introduced are versatile and can be extended to various optimization problems.

Abstract: The integration of machine learning with automated experimentation in self-driving laboratories (SDL) offers a powerful approach to accelerate discovery and optimization tasks in science and engineering applications. When supported by findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data infrastructure, SDLs with overlapping interests can collaborate more effectively. This work presents a distributed SDL implementation built on nanoHUB services for online simulation and FAIR data management. In this framework, geographically dispersed collaborators conducting independent optimization tasks contribute raw experimental data to a shared central database. These researchers can then benefit from analysis tools and machine learning models that automatically update as additional data become available. New data points are submitted through a simple web interface and automatically processed using a nanoHUB Sim2L, which extracts derived quantities and indexes all inputs and outputs in a FAIR data repository called ResultsDB. A separate nanoHUB workflow enables sequential optimization using active learning, where researchers define the optimization objective, and machine learning models are trained on-the-fly with all existing data, guiding the selection of future experiments. Inspired by the concept of ``frugal twin", the optimization task seeks to find the optimal recipe to combine food dyes to achieve the desired target color. With easily accessible and inexpensive materials, researchers and students can set up their own experiments, share data with collaborators, and explore the combination of FAIR data, predictive ML models, and sequential optimization. The tools introduced are generally applicable and can easily be extended to other optimization problems.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel Self-Explainable Zero-shot Human Activity Recognition Network (SEZ-HARN) model for IMU-based HAR. SEZ-HARN addresses the lack of comprehensive datasets and transparency in existing models. It can recognize new activities and provide explanations through skeleton videos. Evaluation on benchmark datasets shows competitive Zero-shot recognition accuracy and realistic explanations. SEZ-HARN achieves a prediction accuracy within 3% of the best black-box model on PAMAP2 and maintains comparable performance on other datasets.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR), which uses data from Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors, has many practical applications in healthcare and assisted living environments. However, its use in real-world scenarios has been limited by the lack of comprehensive IMU-based HAR datasets that cover a wide range of activities and the lack of transparency in existing HAR models. Zero-shot HAR (ZS-HAR) overcomes the data limitations, but current models struggle to explain their decisions, making them less transparent. This paper introduces a novel IMU-based ZS-HAR model called the Self-Explainable Zero-shot Human Activity Recognition Network (SEZ-HARN). It can recognize activities not encountered during training and provide skeleton videos to explain its decision-making process. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed SEZ-HARN on four benchmark datasets PAMAP2, DaLiAc, HTD-MHAD and MHealth and compare its performance against three state-of-the-art black-box ZS-HAR models. The experiment results demonstrate that SEZ-HARN produces realistic and understandable explanations while achieving competitive Zero-shot recognition accuracy. SEZ-HARN achieves a Zero-shot prediction accuracy within 3\% of the best-performing black-box model on PAMAP2 while maintaining comparable performance on the other three datasets.

<div> knowledge distillation, small language models, large language models, reward-guided dataset distillation, student model

Summary:
AdvDistill introduces a reward-guided dataset distillation framework to improve the performance of small language models learning from large language models. This framework incorporates multiple generations of responses from the teacher model for each prompt and assigns rewards based on rule-based verifiers. These rewards, representing weights during training, lead to significant enhancements in student model performance on reasoning tasks. Unlike traditional distillation methods where the student model simply mimics the teacher's responses, AdvDistill offers a more nuanced approach that prioritizes generalizability and computational efficiency. By leveraging rewarding mechanisms in dataset distillation, this study showcases the effectiveness and benefits of integrating incentives into the learning process for small language models. <div>
arXiv:2507.00054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The push to compress and impart the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) into more deployable and efficient Small Language Models (SLMs) has benefited from improvements in knowledge distillation (KD) techniques. These techniques allow a smaller student model to learn from a more capable and larger teacher model's responses. However, distillation often revolves around the student model merely copying the teacher's in-distribution responses, limiting its generalisability. This limitation is amplified on reasoning tasks and can be computationally expensive. In this study, we propose AdvDistill, a reward-guided dataset distillation framework. We utilise multiple generations (responses) from a teacher for each prompt and assign rewards based on rule-based verifiers. These varying and normally distributed rewards serve as weights when training student models. Our methods and their subsequent behavioural analysis demonstrate a significant improvement in student model performance for mathematical and complex reasoning tasks, showcasing the efficacy and benefits of incorporating a rewarding mechanism in dataset distillation processes.

Summary: <br />
The paper discusses the concept of open-endedness in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) research and the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in interpreting image inputs. It introduces VoyagerVision, a multi-modal model that utilizes visual feedback from Minecraft screenshots to create structures within the game environment. VoyagerVision extends the capabilities of the previous model, Voyager, by successfully creating an average of 2.75 unique structures in fifty iterations. The model shows promise in flat worlds, achieving success in half of all building unit tests. However, more complex structures present challenges. Overall, VoyagerVision demonstrates the potential of combining visual inputs with language models to enhance spatial understanding and task performance in AGI systems. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Open-endedness is an active field of research in the pursuit of capable Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), allowing models to pursue tasks of their own choosing. Simultaneously, recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o [9] have allowed such models to be capable of interpreting image inputs. Implementations such as OMNI-EPIC [4] have made use of such features, providing an LLM with pixel data of an agent's POV to parse the environment and allow it to solve tasks. This paper proposes that providing these visual inputs to a model gives it greater ability to interpret spatial environments, and as such, can increase the number of tasks it can successfully perform, extending its open-ended potential. To this aim, this paper proposes VoyagerVision -- a multi-modal model capable of creating structures within Minecraft using screenshots as a form of visual feedback, building on the foundation of Voyager. VoyagerVision was capable of creating an average of 2.75 unique structures within fifty iterations of the system, as Voyager was incapable of this, it is an extension in an entirely new direction. Additionally, in a set of building unit tests VoyagerVision was successful in half of all attempts in flat worlds, with most failures arising in more complex structures.

Summary: 
SAGE-nano, a 4-billion-parameter reasoning model, introduces textbfinverse reasoning, a novel paradigm that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to explain their own reasoning chains post-hoc. By employing a metacognitive structure that reflects back via attention processes, SAGE-nano can identify major decision points and generate explanations for its reasoning choices. Through rigorous testing on various logical reasoning puzzles and benchmarks, SAGE-nano has demonstrated high reasoning accuracy (74.6% on AQUA-RAT) and explanation quality (92.1% human preference score) comparable to models like Claude-3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o. This framework not only improves reasoning performance but also enhances interpretability and transparency in AI systems. By advancing the field of inverse reasoning, this work contributes to AI safety, education, and scientific discovery, creating new avenues for the development of transparent AI systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities at solving complex reasoning tasks with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, but their decision-making processes remain somewhat blackbox. We introduce textbfinverse reasoning, a novel paradigm enabling LLMs to decompose and explain their own reasoning chains post-hoc. Our approach, used in SAGE-nano, a 4-billion-parameter reasoning model, employs a metacognitive structure that reflects back via attention processes to identify major decision points and generate explanations of reasoning choices. While typical CoT approaches are directed towards forward reasoning generation, inverse reasoning provides insight into why specific reasoning chains were selected over others. Through thorough testing of logical reasoning puzzles, math problems and ethical dilemmas from AQUA-RAT, CommonsenseQA, and customized benchmarks, we demonstrate that SAGE-nano is at the cutting edge both on reasoning accuracy (74.6% on AQUA-RAT) and explanation quality (92.1% human preference score) for its task, and offers performance almost on par with models like Claude-3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4o. Our contributions are: (i) the first rigorous framework for LLM self-reflection via inverse reasoning, (ii) a novel metalearning framework to reverse the attention flow, (iii) comprehensive evaluation frameworks for reasoning transparency, and (iv) evidence that increasing reasoning using inverse reasoning improves interpretability along with reasoning performance. Our work creates new avenues for transparent AI systems and closes significant gaps in AI safety, education, and scientific discovery.

Summary: 
The paper discusses the challenge of modernizing legacy software systems due to a lack of documentation and understanding of the original decision logic. A novel pipeline is proposed to extract interpretable decision logic from legacy systems treated as black boxes. The approach utilizes a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to explore the input space and identify critical decision boundaries by rewarding actions that cause meaningful output changes. Counterfactual state transitions are collected and clustered using K-Means, and decision trees are trained on these clusters to extract human-readable rules near the identified boundaries. The effectiveness of the pipeline is demonstrated on dummy legacy systems with varying complexity, showcasing the successful exploration of relevant boundary regions and accurate extraction of core decision logic. This approach provides a promising foundation for generating specifications and test cases during legacy migration.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Modernizing legacy software systems is a critical but challenging task, often hampered by a lack of documentation and understanding of the original system's intricate decision logic. Traditional approaches like behavioral cloning merely replicate input-output behavior without capturing the underlying intent. This paper proposes a novel pipeline to automatically extract interpretable decision logic from legacy systems treated as black boxes. The approach uses a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to explore the input space and identify critical decision boundaries by rewarding actions that cause meaningful changes in the system's output. These counterfactual state transitions, where the output changes, are collected and clustered using K-Means. Decision trees are then trained on these clusters to extract human-readable rules that approximate the system's decision logic near the identified boundaries. I demonstrated the pipeline's effectiveness on three dummy legacy systems with varying complexity, including threshold-based, combined-conditional, and non-linear range logic. Results show that the RL agent successfully focuses exploration on relevant boundary regions, and the extracted rules accurately reflect the core logic of the underlying dummy systems, providing a promising foundation for generating specifications and test cases during legacy migration.

Abstract: Despite the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in education, concerns have emerged about their potential to reduce deep thinking and active learning. This study investigates the impact of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, specifically ChatGPT, on the cognitive engagement of students during academic writing tasks. The study employed an experimental design with participants randomly assigned to either an AI-assisted (ChatGPT) or a non-assisted (control) condition. Participants completed a structured argumentative writing task followed by a cognitive engagement scale (CES), the CES-AI, developed to assess mental effort, attention, deep processing, and strategic thinking. The results revealed significantly lower cognitive engagement scores in the ChatGPT group compared to the control group. These findings suggest that AI assistance may lead to cognitive offloading. The study contributes to the growing body of literature on the psychological implications of AI in education and raises important questions about the integration of such tools into academic practice. It calls for pedagogical strategies that promote active, reflective engagement with AI-generated content to avoid compromising self-regulated learning and deep cognitive involvement of students.

Abstract: With the increasing interest in deploying Artificial Intelligence in medicine, we previously introduced HAIM (Holistic AI in Medicine), a framework that fuses multimodal data to solve downstream clinical tasks. However, HAIM uses data in a task-agnostic manner and lacks explainability. To address these limitations, we introduce xHAIM (Explainable HAIM), a novel framework leveraging Generative AI to enhance both prediction and explainability through four structured steps: (1) automatically identifying task-relevant patient data across modalities, (2) generating comprehensive patient summaries, (3) using these summaries for improved predictive modeling, and (4) providing clinical explanations by linking predictions to patient-specific medical knowledge. Evaluated on the HAIM-MIMIC-MM dataset, xHAIM improves average AUC from 79.9% to 90.3% across chest pathology and operative tasks. Importantly, xHAIM transforms AI from a black-box predictor into an explainable decision support system, enabling clinicians to interactively trace predictions back to relevant patient data, bridging AI advancements with clinical utility.

Abstract: This paper reviews the current progress in applying machine learning (ML) tools to solve NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, with a focus on routing problems such as the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and the vehicle routing problem (VRP). Due to the inherent complexity of these problems, exact algorithms often require excessive computational time to find optimal solutions, while heuristics can only provide approximate solutions without guaranteeing optimality. With the recent success of machine learning models, there is a growing trend in proposing and implementing diverse ML techniques to enhance the resolution of these challenging routing problems. We propose a taxonomy categorizing ML-based routing methods into construction-based and improvement-based approaches, highlighting their applicability to various problem characteristics. This review aims to integrate traditional OR methods with state-of-the-art ML techniques, providing a structured framework to guide future research and address emerging VRP variants.

<div> Keywords: ASTRO, Autoregressive Search-Taught Reasoner, language models, reinforcement learning, search behavior<br />
Summary:<br />
ASTRO is a framework that trains language models to reason like search algorithms, incorporating self-reflection, backtracking, and exploration. By utilizing a synthetic dataset from Monte Carlo Tree Search, ASTRO helps non-reasoner models like Llama 3 develop structured search behavior. This approach involves converting search traces into natural language chain-of-thoughts, enabling models to learn from successes and failures. Through fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, ASTRO boosts the reasoning capabilities of Llama 3 models, leading to significant performance improvements on mathematical problem-solving tasks. The results show a 16.0% increase on MATH-500, 26.9% on AMC 2023, and 20.0% on AIME 2024, particularly enhancing performance on complex problems requiring iterative correction. This study showcases how incorporating search-inspired training can effectively enhance the reasoning abilities of open language models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.00417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce ASTRO, the "Autoregressive Search-Taught Reasoner", a framework for training language models to reason like search algorithms, explicitly leveraging self-reflection, backtracking, and exploration in their outputs. Recently, training large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL) has led to the advent of reasoning models with greatly enhanced reasoning capabilities. Open-source replications of reasoning models, while successful, build upon models that already exhibit strong reasoning capabilities along with search behavior observed even before RL. As a result, it is yet unclear how to boost the reasoning capabilities of other non-reasoner models including Llama 3. ASTRO teaches such models to internalize structured search behavior through a synthetic dataset derived from Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) over mathematical problem-solving trajectories. By converting search traces into natural language chain-of-thoughts that capture both successes and recoveries from failure, ASTRO bootstraps models with a rich prior for exploration during RL. We finetune our models on these search-derived traces and further improve performance via RL with verifiable rewards. We apply ASTRO to the Llama 3 family of models and achieve absolute performance gains of 16.0% on MATH-500, 26.9% on AMC 2023, and 20.0% on AIME 2024, especially improving upon challenging problems that require iterative correction. Our results demonstrate that search-inspired training offers a principled way to instill robust reasoning capabilities into open LLMs.

Summary:<br />

Abstract: Math reasoning has become the poster child of progress in large language models (LLMs), with new models rapidly surpassing human-level performance on benchmarks like MATH and AIME. But as math leaderboards improve week by week, it is worth asking: do these gains reflect broader problem-solving ability or just narrow overfitting? To answer this question, we evaluate over 20 open-weight reasoning-tuned models across a broad suite of tasks, including math, scientific QA, agent planning, coding, and standard instruction-following. We surprisingly find that most models that succeed in math fail to transfer their gains to other domains. To rigorously study this phenomenon, we conduct controlled experiments on Qwen3-14B models using math-only data but different tuning methods. We find that reinforcement learning (RL)-tuned models generalize well across domains, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-tuned models often forget general capabilities. Latent-space representation and token-space distribution shift analyses reveal that SFT induces substantial representation and output drift, while RL preserves general-domain structure. Our results suggest a need to rethink standard post-training recipes, particularly the reliance on SFT-distilled data for advancing reasoning models.

<div> Keywords: Satisfiability Modulo Theory, Nonlinear Real Arithmetic, Local Search, MCSAT framework, 2d-LS

Summary: 
In this paper, the authors propose enhancements to local search for Satisfiability Modulo the Theory of Nonlinear Real Arithmetic (SMT-NRA). They introduce a new two-dimensional cell-jump move called $2d$-cell-jump to improve the existing local search method. The extended local search framework, $2d$-LS, integrates the model constructing satisfiability calculus (MCSAT) framework for increased search efficiency. By implementing the sample-cell projection operator for MCSAT, the efficiency of the search process is further improved by guiding it away from conflicting states in the real domain. Additionally, a hybrid framework for SMT-NRA is designed, combining MCSAT, $2d$-LS, and OpenCAD to enhance search efficiency through information exchange. Experimental results show significant improvements in local search performance, validating the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we advance local search for Satisfiability Modulo the Theory of Nonlinear Real Arithmetic (SMT-NRA for short). First, we introduce a two-dimensional cell-jump move, called \emph{$2d$-cell-jump}, generalizing the key operation, cell-jump, of the local search method for SMT-NRA. Then, we propose an extended local search framework, named \emph{$2d$-LS} (following the local search framework, LS, for SMT-NRA), integrating the model constructing satisfiability calculus (MCSAT) framework to improve search efficiency. To further improve the efficiency of MCSAT, we implement a recently proposed technique called \emph{sample-cell projection operator} for MCSAT, which is well suited for CDCL-style search in the real domain and helps guide the search away from conflicting states. Finally, we design a hybrid framework for SMT-NRA combining MCSAT, $2d$-LS and OpenCAD, to improve search efficiency through information exchange. The experimental results demonstrate improvements in local search performance, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

<div> Keywords: reinforcement learning, large language models, strategic reasoning, chess, knowledge distillation

Summary:
Reinforcement learning (RL) is applied to large language models (LLMs) for strategic reasoning in chess. Using a chess-pretrained action-value network, dense rewards are provided to improve move quality, resembling knowledge distillation. Experimental results show that these dense rewards outperform sparse binary rewards but fall short of expert levels. Ablation studies reveal that the limitations may result from a lack of deep internal understanding of chess in the pretrained models, which RL alone might not fully address. Despite promising outcomes with dense rewards, strategic reasoning in chess for LLMs remains a challenge. This study highlights the importance of incorporating domain-specific knowledge and the complexities involved in enhancing strategic reasoning capabilities in LLMs through RL methods.

<br /><br />Summary: 
Keywords: reinforcement learning, large language models, strategic reasoning, chess, knowledge distillation 
Key points: RL for strategic reasoning in chess with LLMs, dense rewards outperform sparse rewards but fall short of expert levels, deficiency in internal chess understanding limits progress, RL alone may not fully address this limitation, challenges in advancing strategic reasoning capabilities in LLMs. <div>
arXiv:2507.00726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) has shown promise in mathematical reasoning, strategic reasoning for LLMs using RL remains largely unexplored. We investigate whether LLMs can develop strategic reasoning capabilities through RL in chess. To this end, we leverage a chess-pretrained action-value network to provide dense reward on the LLM's output move quality, which can be seen as a form of knowledge distillation. Our experiments show that our distillation-based dense rewards often outperform sparse binary rewards. However, surprisingly, all models plateau far below expert levels. We provide SFT and RL ablations on chess reasoning training and find evidence that this limitation stems from a deficit in the pretrained models' internal understanding of chess--a deficit which RL alone may not be able to fully overcome.

Summary: 
This study addresses the security risks associated with mobile multimodal agents, which face potential jailbreak threats from attackers manipulating agent behaviors to perform sensitive operations. Existing security measures have limitations in detecting risky behaviors across multiple interactions. The research proposes a risk discrimination mechanism that incorporates behavioral sequence information and an automated assisted assessment scheme utilizing a large language model. Through validation on high-risk tasks, the method shows improved recognition of risky behaviors and aids in reducing agent jailbreaking. The study aims to contribute valuable insights for enhancing security risk modeling and protection in multimodal intelligent agent systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.00841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the wide application of multimodal foundation models in intelligent agent systems, scenarios such as mobile device control, intelligent assistant interaction, and multimodal task execution are gradually relying on such large model-driven agents. However, the related systems are also increasingly exposed to potential jailbreak risks. Attackers may induce the agents to bypass the original behavioral constraints through specific inputs, and then trigger certain risky and sensitive operations, such as modifying settings, executing unauthorized commands, or impersonating user identities, which brings new challenges to system security. Existing security measures for intelligent agents still have limitations when facing complex interactions, especially in detecting potentially risky behaviors across multiple rounds of conversations or sequences of tasks. In addition, an efficient and consistent automated methodology to assist in assessing and determining the impact of such risks is currently lacking. This work explores the security issues surrounding mobile multimodal agents, attempts to construct a risk discrimination mechanism by incorporating behavioral sequence information, and designs an automated assisted assessment scheme based on a large language model. Through preliminary validation in several representative high-risk tasks, the results show that the method can improve the recognition of risky behaviors to some extent and assist in reducing the probability of agents being jailbroken. We hope that this study can provide some valuable references for the security risk modeling and protection of multimodal intelligent agent systems.

Summary: 
This paper discusses the pursuit of achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and the limitations faced by current models like GPT-4.5 and DeepSeek. It emphasizes the importance of modular reasoning, persistent memory, and multi-agent coordination in developing AGI systems. The rise of Agentic RAG frameworks, which combine retrieval, planning, and dynamic tool use, is highlighted for enabling more adaptive behavior. Generalization strategies such as information compression, test-time adaptation, and training-free methods are crucial for flexible intelligence.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.00951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can machines truly think, reason and act in domains like humans? This enduring question continues to shape the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Despite the growing capabilities of models such as GPT-4.5, DeepSeek, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Phi-4, and Grok 3, which exhibit multimodal fluency and partial reasoning, these systems remain fundamentally limited by their reliance on token-level prediction and lack of grounded agency. This paper offers a cross-disciplinary synthesis of AGI development, spanning artificial intelligence, cognitive neuroscience, psychology, generative models, and agent-based systems. We analyze the architectural and cognitive foundations of general intelligence, highlighting the role of modular reasoning, persistent memory, and multi-agent coordination. In particular, we emphasize the rise of Agentic RAG frameworks that combine retrieval, planning, and dynamic tool use to enable more adaptive behavior. We discuss generalization strategies, including information compression, test-time adaptation, and training-free methods, as critical pathways toward flexible, domain-agnostic intelligence. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are reexamined not just as perception modules but as evolving interfaces for embodied understanding and collaborative task completion. We also argue that true intelligence arises not from scale alone but from the integration of memory and reasoning: an orchestration of modular, interactive, and self-improving components where compression enables adaptive behavior. Drawing on advances in neurosymbolic systems, reinforcement learning, and cognitive scaffolding, we explore how recent architectures begin to bridge the gap between statistical learning and goal-directed cognition. Finally, we identify key scientific, technical, and ethical challenges on the path to AGI.

Summary: 
Autonomous agents powered by large language models are becoming increasingly common in various assistive tasks, highlighting the importance of ensuring their safe and reliable behavior. To address this need, a novel technique called CIP leveraging causal influence diagrams (CIDs) has been introduced. CIDs offer a structured way to represent cause-and-effect relationships, enabling agents to anticipate harmful outcomes and make safer decisions. The approach involves initializing a CID based on task specifications, guiding agent interactions using the CID, and iteratively refining the CID based on observed behaviors and outcomes. Experimental results show that this method effectively enhances safety in tasks involving code execution and mobile device control. CIP demonstrates promising potential in mitigating risks and improving the reliability of autonomous agents powered by large language models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: As autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) continue to demonstrate potential across various assistive tasks, ensuring their safe and reliable behavior is crucial for preventing unintended consequences. In this work, we introduce CIP, a novel technique that leverages causal influence diagrams (CIDs) to identify and mitigate risks arising from agent decision-making. CIDs provide a structured representation of cause-and-effect relationships, enabling agents to anticipate harmful outcomes and make safer decisions. Our approach consists of three key steps: (1) initializing a CID based on task specifications to outline the decision-making process, (2) guiding agent interactions with the environment using the CID, and (3) iteratively refining the CID based on observed behaviors and outcomes. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively enhances safety in both code execution and mobile device control tasks.

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but suffer from information spreading, which is reframed as an information-theoretic communication issue. To address memory problems in LLMs, HDRAM (Holographically Defined Random Access Memory) is introduced, treating transformer latent space as a spread-spectrum channel. HDRAM uses hypertokens, structured symbolic codes, error-correcting codes (ECC), holographic computing, and quantum-inspired search to recover distributed information through despreading. It enables efficient key-value operations and Grover-style search in latent space. HDRAM integrates ECC, compressed sensing, and Krylov subspace alignment to significantly improve associative retrieval without changing the architecture, showcasing how Classical-Holographic-Quantum-inspired (CHQ) principles can bolster transformer architectures. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities but suffer from apparent precision loss, reframed here as information spreading. This reframing shifts the problem from computational precision to an information-theoretic communication issue. We address the K:V and V:K memory problem in LLMs by introducing HDRAM (Holographically Defined Random Access Memory), a symbolic memory framework treating transformer latent space as a spread-spectrum channel. Built upon hypertokens, structured symbolic codes integrating classical error-correcting codes (ECC), holographic computing, and quantum-inspired search, HDRAM recovers distributed information through principled despreading. These phase-coherent memory addresses enable efficient key-value operations and Grover-style search in latent space. By combining ECC grammar with compressed sensing and Krylov subspace alignment, HDRAM significantly improves associative retrieval without architectural changes, demonstrating how Classical-Holographic-Quantum-inspired (CHQ) principles can fortify transformer architectures.

Abstract: This paper presents NeutroSENSE, a neutrosophic-enhanced ensemble framework for interpretable intrusion detection in IoT environments. By integrating Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression with neutrosophic logic, the system decomposes prediction confidence into truth (T), falsity (F), and indeterminacy (I) components, enabling uncertainty quantification and abstention. Predictions with high indeterminacy are flagged for review using both global and adaptive, class-specific thresholds. Evaluated on the IoT-CAD dataset, NeutroSENSE achieved 97% accuracy, while demonstrating that misclassified samples exhibit significantly higher indeterminacy (I = 0.62) than correct ones (I = 0.24). The use of indeterminacy as a proxy for uncertainty enables informed abstention and targeted review-particularly valuable in edge deployments. Figures and tables validate the correlation between I-scores and error likelihood, supporting more trustworthy, human-in-the-loop AI decisions. This work shows that neutrosophic logic enhances both accuracy and explainability, providing a practical foundation for trust-aware AI in edge and fog-based IoT security systems.

Summary:
The article discusses the computational, energy, and financial resources required for large language models (LLMs) during training and deployment, with a focus on inference costs. It introduces directed stochastic skill search (DS3) as a framework for efficient inference through a learned skill graph. By analyzing different inference strategies like chain-of-thought (CoT) and tree-of-thought (ToT), the study derives closed-form expressions for task success and compute cost. The framework extends existing models to incorporate inference and empirically observed patterns such as linear accuracy scaling and variation in preferred inference strategies are theoretically recovered. The framework also captures emergent behaviors like reasoning-induced changes in performance and best-of-N (BoN) and majority voting behavior. Ultimately, the framework provides a deeper theoretical understanding of training-inference interdependencies to support algorithmic design and resource allocation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demand considerable computational, energy, and financial resources during both training and deployment. While scaling laws for training have guided much of the field's recent progress, inference costs now represent a significant and growing component of the overall resource burden, particularly for reasoning-focused models. Existing characterizations of compute-optimality that consider model size, dataset size, and inference tokens in isolation or in fixed combinations risk overlooking more efficient operating points. We introduce directed stochastic skill search (DS3), a general framework that represents inference as stochastic traversal over a learned skill graph. From a simplified yet expressive instantiation, we derive closed-form expressions for task success and compute cost across a wide range of inference strategies -- including chain-of-thought (CoT) and tree-of-thought (ToT) -- enabling comparative analysis as a function of task difficulty and model capability. To that end, we extend a prior first-principles tripartite graph framework of LLM training to incorporate inference, and separately bridge DS3 with empirical methods that characterize LLM scaling behavior. We theoretically recover empirically observed patterns, including: linear accuracy scaling with logarithmic compute; variation in preferred inference strategies as a function of task difficulty and model capability; emergent behavior elicited by reasoning even when performance plateaus under parameter scaling; and both best-of-N (BoN) and majority voting behavior captured within a unified analytical framework. By explicitly characterizing training-inference interdependencies, our framework deepens theoretical understanding and supports principled algorithmic design and resource allocation.

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel educational framework that integrates generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) platforms like ChatGPT and Claude into laboratory activities for undergraduate students. Instead of relying uncritically on large language models, the proposed pedagogical model encourages students to treat GenAI as both a research subject and a cognitive tool. In this framework, students create discipline-specific prompts and assess GenAI-generated responses in various modalities. A pilot study in a general astronomy course for non-science majors showed high engagement levels and critical reflection among students, who continued the activity outside of class and presented their findings at a research symposium. The study emphasizes the significance of structured AI interactions in education and suggests that combining GenAI with reflective assessment methods can enhance learning outcomes. The model presented is replicable and adaptable to various scientific disciplines.

Abstract: Efficient elevator traffic management in large buildings is critical for minimizing passenger travel times and energy consumption. Because heuristic- or pattern-detection-based controllers struggle with the stochastic and combinatorial nature of dispatching, we model the six-elevator, fifteen-floor system at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam as a Markov Decision Process and train an end-to-end Reinforcement Learning (RL) Elevator Group Control System (EGCS). Key innovations include a novel action space encoding to handle the combinatorial complexity of elevator dispatching, the introduction of infra-steps to model continuous passenger arrivals, and a tailored reward signal to improve learning efficiency. In addition, we explore various ways to adapt the discounting factor to the infra-step formulation. We investigate RL architectures based on Dueling Double Deep Q-learning, showing that the proposed RL-based EGCS adapts to fluctuating traffic patterns, learns from a highly stochastic environment, and thereby outperforms a traditional rule-based algorithm.

Summary:<br />
- A new training method, CMI minimized (CMIM), is proposed to create undistillable deep neural networks (DNNs) by minimizing conditional mutual information (CMI) values of output probability distributions.
- The CMIM model outperforms DNN models trained with cross entropy alone and is resistant to knowledge distillation (KD) methods.
- Undistillable DNNs have highly concentrated output probability distributions for each label, making them difficult to extract knowledge from.
- The CMIM model collapses clusters of output probabilities, making it challenging to distill information.
- By minimizing CMI values during training, the CMIM model becomes undistillable and demonstrates improved prediction accuracy compared to models trained with conventional methods. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.00012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A deep neural network (DNN) is said to be undistillable if, when used as a black-box input-output teacher, it cannot be distilled through knowledge distillation (KD). In this case, the distilled student (referred to as the knockoff student) does not outperform a student trained independently with label smoothing (LS student) in terms of prediction accuracy. To protect intellectual property of DNNs, it is desirable to build undistillable DNNs. To this end, it is first observed that an undistillable DNN may have the trait that each cluster of its output probability distributions in response to all sample instances with the same label should be highly concentrated to the extent that each cluster corresponding to each label should ideally collapse into one probability distribution. Based on this observation and by measuring the concentration of each cluster in terms of conditional mutual information (CMI), a new training method called CMI minimized (CMIM) method is proposed, which trains a DNN by jointly minimizing the conventional cross entropy (CE) loss and the CMI values of all temperature scaled clusters across the entire temperature spectrum. The resulting CMIM model is shown, by extensive experiments, to be undistillable by all tested KD methods existing in the literature. That is, the knockoff students distilled by these KD methods from the CMIM model underperform the respective LS students. In addition, the CMIM model is also shown to performs better than the model trained with the CE loss alone in terms of their own prediction accuracy.

<div> Seasonal-trend decomposition, masked time-series modeling, entangled patterns, period masking, contrastive learning <br />
Summary:<br />
Forecasting complex time series is crucial for various industrial applications. Traditional masked time-series modeling may learn spurious temporal patterns due to ignoring semantic structure. To address this, a novel framework called ST-MTM is proposed, incorporating seasonal-trend decomposition and innovative masking methods. ST-MTM leverages period masking for seasonal components and sub-series masking for trends to capture distinct temporal semantics effectively. It introduces a contrastive learning task to enhance contextual consistency among multiple masked seasonal representations. Experimental results demonstrate superior forecasting performance of ST-MTM compared to existing methods. The framework effectively pre-trains models on intricate temporal dependencies, improving forecasting accuracy through the decomposition of entangled patterns. <div>

Abstract: Forecasting complex time series is an important yet challenging problem that involves various industrial applications. Recently, masked time-series modeling has been proposed to effectively model temporal dependencies for forecasting by reconstructing masked segments from unmasked ones. However, since the semantic information in time series is involved in intricate temporal variations generated by multiple time series components, simply masking a raw time series ignores the inherent semantic structure, which may cause MTM to learn spurious temporal patterns present in the raw data. To capture distinct temporal semantics, we show that masked modeling techniques should address entangled patterns through a decomposition approach. Specifically, we propose ST-MTM, a masked time-series modeling framework with seasonal-trend decomposition, which includes a novel masking method for the seasonal-trend components that incorporates different temporal variations from each component. ST-MTM uses a period masking strategy for seasonal components to produce multiple masked seasonal series based on inherent multi-periodicity and a sub-series masking strategy for trend components to mask temporal regions that share similar variations. The proposed masking method presents an effective pre-training task for learning intricate temporal variations and dependencies. Additionally, ST-MTM introduces a contrastive learning task to support masked modeling by enhancing contextual consistency among multiple masked seasonal representations. Experimental results show that our proposed ST-MTM achieves consistently superior forecasting performance compared to existing masked modeling, contrastive learning, and supervised forecasting methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results on static code-generation benchmarks, but real-world software development unfolds as a continuous stream of evolving issues, fixes, and feature requests. We introduce SWE-Bench-CL, a novel continual learning benchmark built on the human-verified SWE-Bench Verified dataset introduced by OpenAI and Princeton-NLP in 2024. By organizing GitHub issues into chronologically ordered sequences that reflect natural repository evolution, SWE-Bench-CL enables direct evaluation of an agent's ability to accumulate experience, transfer knowledge across tasks, and resist catastrophic forgetting. We complement the dataset with (i) a preliminary analysis of inter-task structural similarity and contextual sensitivity, (ii) an interactive LangGraph-based evaluation framework augmented with a FAISS-backed semantic memory module, and (iii) a suite of specialized continual learning metrics -- including average accuracy, forgetting, forward/backward transfer, tool-use efficiency, and a generalized Composite Continual Learning Score and CL-F-beta score -- to capture the stability-plasticity trade-off. We outline a rigorous experimental protocol comparing memory-enabled and memory-disabled agents across diverse Python repositories. All code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/thomasjoshi/agents-never-forget, providing the community with a reproducible platform for developing more adaptive and robust AI agents in software engineering.

Summary:<br />
The paper proposes a defensive strategy for transformer-based modulation classification systems to address vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. A novel vision transformer architecture is introduced with an adversarial indicator (AdvI) token for attack detection. This is the first work to incorporate an AdvI token in vision transformers for defense against adversarial attacks. The method combines adversarial training and AdvI token detection in a unified neural network model, simplifying system architecture. The AdvI token influences attention weights, highlighting suspicious regions in input data. Experimental results show superior performance in handling white-box attacks compared to existing methods. This approach outperforms methods using fast gradient, projected gradient descent, and iterative attacks. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: The remarkable success of transformers across various fields such as natural language processing and computer vision has paved the way for their applications in automatic modulation classification, a critical component in the communication systems of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, it has been observed that transformer-based classification of radio signals is susceptible to subtle yet sophisticated adversarial attacks. To address this issue, we have developed a defensive strategy for transformer-based modulation classification systems to counter such adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel vision transformer (ViT) architecture by introducing a new concept known as adversarial indicator (AdvI) token to detect adversarial attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose an AdvI token in ViT to defend against adversarial attacks. Integrating an adversarial training method with a detection mechanism using AdvI token, we combine a training time defense and running time defense in a unified neural network model, which reduces architectural complexity of the system compared to detecting adversarial perturbations using separate models. We investigate into the operational principles of our method by examining the attention mechanism. We show the proposed AdvI token acts as a crucial element within the ViT, influencing attention weights and thereby highlighting regions or features in the input data that are potentially suspicious or anomalous. Through experimental results, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses several competitive methods in handling white-box attack scenarios, including those utilizing the fast gradient method, projected gradient descent attacks and basic iterative method.

Summary: 
The paper introduces an efficient fine-tuning method called GRFT that updates rows or columns of the weight matrix based on gradients, reducing storage overhead and improving parameter selection efficiency. The approach outperforms existing methods like GPS, Adapter Tuning, and LoRA, achieving state-of-the-art results. By updating only a small percentage of total parameters on datasets like FGVC and VTAB, GRFT demonstrates high efficiency and effectiveness. The incorporation of regularization enhances knowledge transfer from pre-trained models. Theoretical analysis shows that updating rows or columns with the highest sum of squared gradients is optimal. The proposed method addresses the computational resource and storage demands associated with fine-tuning large pre-trained models, providing a promising solution for various downstream tasks. Source code for GRFT will be made available soon.

Abstract: Large pre-trained models have demonstrated extensive applications across various fields. However, fine-tuning these models for specific downstream tasks demands significant computational resources and storage. One fine-tuning method, gradient-based parameter selection (GPS), focuses on fine-tuning only the parameters with high gradients in each neuron, thereby reducing the number of training parameters. Nevertheless, this approach increases computational resource requirements and storage demands. In this paper, we propose an efficient gradient-based and regularized fine-tuning method (GRFT) that updates the rows or columns of the weight matrix. We theoretically demonstrate that the rows or columns with the highest sum of squared gradients are optimal for updating. This strategy effectively reduces storage overhead and improves the efficiency of parameter selection. Additionally, we incorporate regularization to enhance knowledge transfer from the pre-trained model. GRFT achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods such as GPS, Adapter Tuning, and LoRA. Notably, GRFT requires updating only 1.22% and 0.30% of the total parameters on FGVC and VTAB datasets, respectively, demonstrating its high efficiency and effectiveness. The source code will be released soon.

Summary:<br />
The article presents a unified theoretical framework that connects Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and preference learning in Large Language Model (LLM) post-training. It shows that both SFT and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) operate within the same optimal policy-reward subspace, with SFT as a form of implicit reward learning. A limitation in conventional SFT is identified, where the KL divergence term remains constant during optimization, hindering model updates. A learning rate reduction approach is proposed to overcome this limitation, leading to performance improvements in instruction following tasks. Alternative SFT objectives derived from f-divergence functions are shown to enhance post-DPO model performance. The article also extends the theoretical relationship between LLM logits and Q-functions from preference learning to the SFT context, with mathematical derivations and experimental validation.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Post-training processes are essential phases in grounding pre-trained language models to real-world tasks, with learning from demonstrations or preference signals playing a crucial role in this adaptation. We present a unified theoretical framework bridging Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and preference learning in Large Language Model (LLM) post-training. Through rigorous mathematical derivation, we demonstrate that both SFT and preference learning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) operate within the same optimal policy-reward subspace, with SFT representing a special case of implicit reward learning. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation in conventional SFT: the KL divergence term in distribution matching becomes constant with respect to the policy during optimization, failing to constrain model updates. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective learning rate reduction approach that yields significant performance improvements (up to \textbf{25\%} relative gain and \textbf{6\%} absolute win rate increase in instruction following tasks. Additionally, we derive alternative SFT objectives from various f-divergence functions that preserve the KL term during optimization, further enhancing post-DPO model performance. Finally, we extend the theoretical relationship between LLM logits and Q-functions from preference learning to the SFT context, providing mathematical derivations and experimental validation.

Summary:
Three quantum-inspired data encoding strategies, Instance Level Strategy (ILS), Global Discrete Strategy (GDS), and Class Conditional Value Strategy (CCVS), are proposed and evaluated for transforming classical data into quantum data in classical machine learning models. Each strategy has different approaches to encoding data, impacting encoding efficiency, correctness, model accuracy, and computational cost. The Instance Level Strategy treats each row independently, the Global Discrete Strategy maps all unique feature values uniformly, and the Class Conditional Value Strategy encodes unique values for each class. By assessing trade-offs between encoding time, precision, and predictive performance, insights are provided for optimizing quantum-inspired data transformations in classical machine learning workflows. This study contributes to the understanding of the impact of quantum data encoding strategies on classification tasks. <div>

Abstract: In this study, we propose, evaluate and compare three quantum inspired data encoding strategies, Instance Level Strategy (ILS), Global Discrete Strategy (GDS) and Class Conditional Value Strategy (CCVS), for transforming classical data into quantum data for use in pure classical machine learning models. The primary objective is to reduce high encoding time while ensuring correct encoding values and analyzing their impact on classification performance. The Instance Level Strategy treats each row of dataset independently; mimics local quantum states. Global Discrete Value Based encoding strategy maps all unique feature values across the full dataset to quantum states uniformly. In contrast, the Class conditional Value based encoding strategy encodes unique values separately for each class, preserving class dependent information.
  We apply these encoding strategies to a classification task and assess their impact on en-coding efficiency, correctness, model accuracy, and computational cost. By analyzing the trade offs between encoding time, precision, and predictive performance, this study provides insights into optimizing quantum inspired data transformations for classical machine learning workflows.

Abstract: With the growing demand for novel materials, machine learning-driven inverse design methods face significant challenges in reconciling the high-dimensional materials composition space with limited experimental data. Existing approaches suffer from two major limitations: (I) machine learning models often lack reliability in high-dimensional spaces, leading to prediction biases during the design process; (II) these models fail to effectively incorporate domain expert knowledge, limiting their capacity to support knowledge-guided inverse design. To address these challenges, we introduce AIMatDesign, a reinforcement learning framework that addresses these limitations by augmenting experimental data using difference-based algorithms to build a trusted experience pool, accelerating model convergence. To enhance model reliability, an automated refinement strategy guided by large language models (LLMs) dynamically corrects prediction inconsistencies, reinforcing alignment between reward signals and state value functions. Additionally, a knowledge-based reward function leverages expert domain rules to improve stability and efficiency during training. Our experiments demonstrate that AIMatDesign significantly surpasses traditional machine learning and reinforcement learning methods in discovery efficiency, convergence speed, and success rates. Among the numerous candidates proposed by AIMatDesign, experimental synthesis of representative Zr-based alloys yielded a top-performing BMG with 1.7GPa yield strength and 10.2\% elongation, closely matching predictions. Moreover, the framework accurately captured the trend of yield strength variation with composition, demonstrating its reliability and potential for closed-loop materials discovery.

Summary: 
Fourier Neural Simulator for Dynamical Adaptation (FNSDA) is introduced to effectively learn underlying dynamics and generalize to new environments by adapting in the Fourier space. FNSDA identifies shareable dynamics based on known environments, partitions Fourier modes, and learns to adjust modes for each new environment based on latent systematic parameters. This method achieves superior or competitive generalization performance in various dynamic systems while significantly reducing parameter cost. The approach is demonstrated on four dynamic system families, showcasing its ability to adapt to new environments and make reliable predictions. The code for FNSDA is publicly available for further exploration and implementation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Learning the underlying dynamics from data with deep neural networks has shown remarkable potential in modeling various complex physical dynamics. However, current approaches are constrained in their ability to make reliable predictions in a specific domain and struggle with generalizing to unseen systems that are governed by the same general dynamics but differ in environmental characteristics. In this work, we formulate a parameter-efficient method, Fourier Neural Simulator for Dynamical Adaptation (FNSDA), that can readily generalize to new dynamics via adaptation in the Fourier space. Specifically, FNSDA identifies the shareable dynamics based on the known environments using an automatic partition in Fourier modes and learns to adjust the modes specific for each new environment by conditioning on low-dimensional latent systematic parameters for efficient generalization. We evaluate our approach on four representative families of dynamic systems, and the results show that FNSDA can achieve superior or competitive generalization performance compared to existing methods with a significantly reduced parameter cost.

Summary:
The article discusses the importance of evaluating the safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications, particularly in the face of adversarial prompts. Existing manual safety benchmarks are limited in adaptability and topic coverage, necessitating the development of more dynamic evaluation methods. The proposed Reality-Oriented Safety Evaluation (ROSE) framework leverages multi-objective reinforcement learning to generate diverse and contextually rich adversarial prompts for LLM testing. Experiments demonstrate ROSE's superiority in uncovering safety vulnerabilities in advanced LLMs, with significant enhancements in evaluation metrics. By addressing the shortcomings of current automated prompt generation methods and emphasizing real-world contextualization, ROSE offers a more practical approach to evaluating the safety of LLMs.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.00026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as black-box components in real-world applications, evaluating their safety-especially under adversarial prompting-has become critical. Arguably, effective safety evaluations should be adaptive, evolving with LLM capabilities, and also cover a broad spectrum of harmful topics and real-world scenarios to fully expose potential vulnerabilities. Existing manual safety benchmarks, built on handcrafted adversarial prompts, are limited by their static nature and the intensive labor required to update them, making it difficult to keep pace with rapidly advancing LLMs. In contrast, automated adversarial prompt generation offers a promising path toward adaptive evaluation. However, current methods often suffer from insufficient adversarial topic coverage (topic-level diversity) and weak alignment with real-world contexts. These shortcomings stem from the exploration-exploitation dilemma in black-box optimization and a lack of real-world contextualization, resulting in adversarial prompts that are both topically narrow and scenario-repetitive. To address these issues, we propose Reality-Oriented Safety Evaluation (ROSE), a novel framework that uses multi-objective reinforcement learning to fine-tune an adversarial LLM for generating topically diverse and contextually rich adversarial prompts. Experiments show that ROSE outperforms existing methods in uncovering safety vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art LLMs, with notable improvements in integrated evaluation metrics. We hope ROSE represents a step toward more practical and reality-oriented safety evaluation of LLMs. WARNING: This paper contains examples of potentially harmful text.

The article introduces HiT-JEPA, a framework for effectively representing urban trajectory data. It addresses the challenge of capturing diverse information by incorporating fine-grained details and high-level summaries in a unified model. HiT-JEPA utilizes a three-layer hierarchy to capture point-level details, intermediate patterns, and high-level abstractions, allowing for the integration of local dynamics and global semantics. Experimental results demonstrate that the hierarchical design of HiT-JEPA produces richer, multi-scale representations, enhancing trajectory similarity computation. The framework provides a comprehensive approach to learning urban trajectory representations across semantic abstraction levels and offers a solution to the limitations of existing methods in capturing both long-term dependencies and local nuances simultaneously. <br /> <div>

Abstract: The representation of urban trajectory data plays a critical role in effectively analyzing spatial movement patterns. Despite considerable progress, the challenge of designing trajectory representations that can capture diverse and complementary information remains an open research problem. Existing methods struggle in incorporating trajectory fine-grained details and high-level summary in a single model, limiting their ability to attend to both long-term dependencies while preserving local nuances. To address this, we propose HiT-JEPA (Hierarchical Interactions of Trajectory Semantics via a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture), a unified framework for learning multi-scale urban trajectory representations across semantic abstraction levels. HiT-JEPA adopts a three-layer hierarchy that progressively captures point-level fine-grained details, intermediate patterns, and high-level trajectory abstractions, enabling the model to integrate both local dynamics and global semantics in one coherent structure. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets for trajectory similarity computation show that HiT-JEPA's hierarchical design yields richer, multi-scale representations.

The LoRA-Mixer framework addresses limitations in adapting large language models to multiple tasks by integrating low-rank adaptation (LoRA) experts into a modular mixture-of-experts (MoE) design. The framework replaces projection matrices with dynamically routed, task-specific LoRA experts, ensuring compatibility with various foundation models. It supports joint optimization of experts and routing mechanisms or deployment of pre-trained LoRA modules. An adaptive Specialization Balance Loss (SBL) optimizes expert balance and task alignment. Extensive experiments show significant improvements in performance on benchmark datasets, with LoRA-Mixer outperforming state-of-the-art methods with fewer parameters. <div>

Abstract: Recent efforts to combine low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with mixture-of-experts (MoE) for adapting large language models (LLMs) to multiple tasks still exhibit prevailing limitations: they either swap entire attention/feed-forward layers for switch experts or bolt on parallel expert branches, diluting parameter efficiency and task fidelity. We propose the LoRA-Mixer, a modular and lightweight MoE framework that integrates LoRA experts. Our core innovation lies in replacing the projection matrices of the attention module's input/output linear layers with dynamically routed, task-specific LoRA experts. This design ensures seamless compatibility with diverse foundation models, including transformers and state space models (SSMs), by leveraging their inherent linear projection structures. The framework supports two operational paradigms: (1) joint optimization of LoRA experts and routing mechanisms via a novel hard-soft routing strategy, or (2) direct deployment of pre-trained, frozen LoRA modules sourced from external repositories. To enable robust router training with limited data while ensuring stable routing decisions and maximizing expert reuse, we introduce an adaptive Specialization Balance Loss (SBL) that jointly optimizes expert balance and task-specific alignment. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets, including MedQA, CoLA, SST-2, GSM8K, ARC-E, ARC-C, and HumanEval, demonstrate the effectiveness of LoRA-Mixer. On datasets such as GSM8K, HumanEval, and MedQA, LoRA-Mixer achieves significant improvements of 7.61%, 4.88%, and 3.08% over the base models, respectively. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, LoRA-Mixer achieves additional improvements of 1.09%, 1.45%, and 1.68%, respectively, using only 48% of the parameters, demonstrating its efficiency and strong performance.

Compared to a graph-based model, KUL-KT trained faster and used significantly less memory, making it a memory-efficient framework for personalized learning at scale. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.00032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce KUL-KT, a biologically inspired architecture for knowledge tracing (KT), combining Hebbian memory encoding with gradient-based consolidation in a scalable, input-agnostic framework. KUL-KT adapts the principle of memory consolidation in neural systems, to student modeling by introducing two key innovations: (i) a time-decaying Hebbian memory update that enables graceful forgetting, and (ii) a novel Loss-aligned Internal Target (LIT) method to compute an ideal internal state, allowing continual learning without backpropagation through time. The architecture consists of a fast Hebbian memory that captures each learner interaction via a single associative update, and a slower linear network that consolidates recalled samples through gradient descent. This design enables few-shot personalization and natural forgetting without storing raw data or relying on large cohort training. Operating entirely in embedding space, KUL-KT supports both structured (tabular) and unstructured (short-answer) inputs. Empirically, KUL-KT outperforms strong baselines on ten public KT benchmarks in rank-sensitive metrics such as nDCG and Recall@10. In a classroom deployment, KUL-KT personalized quizzes from short-answer data, leading to improved learner-perceived helpfulness and reduced difficulty (p < 0.05). Ablation studies confirm that Hebbian decay and LIT are critical for continual adaptation. Compared to a strong graph-based KT model, KUL-KT trains 1.75x faster and uses 99.01\% less memory.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video large language models (Video LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of video question answering (VideoQA). While existing methods perform well on short videos, they often struggle with long-range reasoning in longer videos. To scale Video LLMs for longer video content, frame sub-sampling (selecting frames at regular intervals) is commonly used. However, this approach is suboptimal, often leading to the loss of crucial frames or the inclusion of redundant information from multiple similar frames. Missing key frames impairs the model's ability to answer questions accurately, while redundant frames lead the model to focus on irrelevant video segments and increase computational resource consumption. In this paper, we investigate the use of a general-purpose text-to-video moment retrieval model to guide the frame sampling process. We propose "moment sampling", a novel, model-agnostic approach that enables the model to select the most relevant frames according to the context of the question. Specifically, we employ a lightweight moment retrieval model to prioritize frame selection. By focusing on the frames most pertinent to the given question, our method enhances long-form VideoQA performance in Video LLMs. Through extensive experiments on four long-form VideoQA datasets, using four state-of-the-art Video LLMs, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Summary:<br />
Model fusion involves combining multiple trained neural networks into a single representative model. This process is complicated by differences in internal representations due to various factors like permutation invariance and random initialization. A novel family of neuron-centric algorithms has been developed to effectively integrate parent models by grouping intermediate neurons and approximating target representations with corresponding sub-networks. These algorithms incorporate neuron attribution scores and can generalize to different layer types. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed algorithms outperform previous fusion techniques, especially in zero-shot and non-IID fusion scenarios. The code for the algorithms is available on GitHub. <div>

Abstract: Model fusion aims to combine the knowledge of multiple models by creating one representative model that captures the strengths of all of its parents. However, this process is non-trivial due to differences in internal representations, which can stem from permutation invariance, random initialization, or differently distributed training data. We present a novel, neuron-centric family of model fusion algorithms designed to integrate multiple trained neural networks into a single network effectively regardless of training data distribution. Our algorithms group intermediate neurons of parent models to create target representations that the fused model approximates with its corresponding sub-network. Unlike prior approaches, our approach incorporates neuron attribution scores into the fusion process. Furthermore, our algorithms can generalize to arbitrary layer types. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our algorithms consistently outperform previous fusion techniques, particularly in zero-shot and non-IID fusion scenarios.

Summary: <br />
Data reduction is crucial for enhancing data-centric AI by selecting the most informative instances from large datasets to improve model training efficiency. This paper introduces a data reduction strategy based on Pointwise V-information (PVI) to identify optimal instances for improved model performance. By filtering out low-difficulty instances using PVI, the approach achieves a significant reduction in data size (10%-30%) with minimal loss in classifier accuracy. Additionally, a progressive learning technique utilizing instances sorted by PVI leads to accelerated convergence and a 0.8% increase in accuracy compared to traditional training methods. The study also extends the PVI framework to Chinese NLP tasks, demonstrating its applicability in cross-lingual data reduction and faster training. The released codes provide a valuable resource for implementation and further research in this area. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Data reduction plays a vital role in data-centric AI by identifying the most informative instance within large-scale datasets to enhance model training efficiency. The core challenge lies in how to select the optimal instances-rather than the entire datasets-to improve data quality and training efficiency. In this paper, we propose an effective data reduction strategy based on Pointwise V-information(PVI). First, we quantify instance difficulty using PVI and filter out low-difficulty instances enabling a static approach. Experiments demonstrate that removing 10%-30% of the data preserves the classifier performance with only a 0.0001% to 0.76% loss in accuracy.Second, we use a progressive learning approach to training the classifiers on instances sorted by ascending PVI, accelerating convergence and achieving a 0.8% accuracy gain over conventional training. Our results suggest that with the effective data reduction strategy, training a classifier on the selected optimal subset could enhance the model performance and boost training efficiency. Moreover, we have transferred the PVI framework, which previously applied only to English datasets, to diverse Chinese NLP tasks and base models, leading to valuable insights for cross-lingual data reduction and faster training.

<div> Keywords: Graph classification, Quality measures, Pattern ranking, Benchmark, Clustering

Summary: 
This article presents a comparative analysis of 38 quality measures used in graph classification tasks. The measures are characterized based on four mathematical properties and evaluated empirically using publicly available datasets. A gold standard ranking of patterns is established to compare the performance of the measures. The study introduces a clustering-based preprocessing step to group similar patterns for improved classification results. Results indicate that some commonly used measures in the literature may not be optimal for classification tasks. The proposed preprocessing step reduces the number of patterns to process while maintaining comparable performance. The research highlights the importance of selecting appropriate quality measures for graph classification and suggests that popular measures may not always yield the best results. <div>

Abstract: Graph classification aims to categorize graphs based on their structural and attribute features, with applications in diverse fields such as social network analysis and bioinformatics. Among the methods proposed to solve this task, those relying on patterns (i.e. subgraphs) provide good explainability, as the patterns used for classification can be directly interpreted. To identify meaningful patterns, a standard approach is to use a quality measure, i.e. a function that evaluates the discriminative power of each pattern. However, the literature provides tens of such measures, making it difficult to select the most appropriate for a given application. Only a handful of surveys try to provide some insight by comparing these measures, and none of them specifically focuses on graphs. This typically results in the systematic use of the most widespread measures, without thorough evaluation. To address this issue, we present a comparative analysis of 38 quality measures from the literature. We characterize them theoretically, based on four mathematical properties. We leverage publicly available datasets to constitute a benchmark, and propose a method to elaborate a gold standard ranking of the patterns. We exploit these resources to perform an empirical comparison of the measures, both in terms of pattern ranking and classification performance. Moreover, we propose a clustering-based preprocessing step, which groups patterns appearing in the same graphs to enhance classification performance. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this step, reducing the number of patterns to be processed while achieving comparable performance. Additionally, we show that some popular measures widely used in the literature are not associated with the best results.

Summary:<br />
- In dynamic traffic environments, continual adaptation of edge models for object detection may suffer from catastrophic forgetting.<br />

- The proposed ER-EMU algorithm utilizes adaptive experience replay with a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) buffer and a Domain Distance Metric-based Experience Selection (DDM-ES) algorithm.<br />

arXiv:2507.00042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continually adapting edge models in cloud-edge collaborative object detection for traffic monitoring suffers from catastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously learned knowledge when adapting to new data distributions. This is especially problematic in dynamic traffic environments characterised by periodic variations (e.g., day/night, peak hours), where past knowledge remains valuable. Existing approaches like experience replay and visual prompts offer some mitigation, but struggle to effectively prioritize and leverage historical data for optimal knowledge retention and adaptation. Specifically, simply storing and replaying all historical data can be inefficient, while treating all historical experiences as equally important overlooks their varying relevance to the current domain. This paper proposes ER-EMU, an edge model update algorithm based on adaptive experience replay, to address these limitations. ER-EMU utilizes a limited-size experience buffer managed using a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, and a novel Domain Distance Metric-based Experience Selection (DDM-ES) algorithm. DDM-ES employs the multi-kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD) to quantify the dissimilarity between target domains, prioritizing the selection of historical data that is most dissimilar to the current target domain. This ensures training diversity and facilitates the retention of knowledge from a wider range of past experiences, while also preventing overfitting to the new domain. The experience buffer is also updated using a simple random sampling strategy to maintain a balanced representation of previous domains. Experiments on the Bellevue traffic video dataset, involving repeated day/night cycles, demonstrate that ER-EMU consistently improves the performance of several state-of-the-art cloud-edge collaborative object detection frameworks.

Summary:
MR-CLIP is a framework designed to address the challenges of interpreting MRI scans accurately based on image contrast. It aligns MRI images with DICOM metadata to learn contrast-aware representations without the need for manual labels. The framework is trained on a diverse clinical dataset, capturing contrast variations across acquisitions and within scans to enable anatomy-invariant representations.

The framework offers a solution to the lack of reliable and standardized metadata in MRI datasets, improving image interpretation, retrieval, and integration into clinical workflows. This approach holds promise for advancing clinical applications and achieving modality-invariant representations in the field of medical imaging. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.00043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate interpretation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans in clinical systems is based on a precise understanding of image contrast. This contrast is primarily governed by acquisition parameters, such as echo time and repetition time, which are stored in the DICOM metadata. To simplify contrast identification, broad labels such as T1-weighted or T2-weighted are commonly used, but these offer only a coarse approximation of the underlying acquisition settings. In many real-world datasets, such labels are entirely missing, leaving raw acquisition parameters as the only indicators of contrast. Adding to this challenge, the available metadata is often incomplete, noisy, or inconsistent. The lack of reliable and standardized metadata complicates tasks such as image interpretation, retrieval, and integration into clinical workflows. Furthermore, robust contrast-aware representations are essential to enable more advanced clinical applications, such as achieving modality-invariant representations and data harmonization. To address these challenges, we propose MR-CLIP, a multimodal contrastive learning framework that aligns MR images with their DICOM metadata to learn contrast-aware representations, without relying on manual labels. Trained on a diverse clinical dataset that spans various scanners and protocols, MR-CLIP captures contrast variations across acquisitions and within scans, enabling anatomy-invariant representations. We demonstrate its effectiveness in cross-modal retrieval and contrast classification, highlighting its scalability and potential for further clinical applications. The code and weights are publicly available at https://github.com/myigitavci/MR-CLIP.

Summary:
In the field of cancer diagnostics, Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) is a key technology for digitizing tissue specimens. However, artifacts introduced during slide preparation and scanning can compromise the accuracy of analysis. To tackle this issue, three robust artifact detection approaches were compared: a foundation model-based approach (FMA), a deep learning approach (DLA), and a knowledge-based approach (KBA). Evaluations on 50,000+ image patches from various scanners showed that the FMA outperformed the other methods with a high patch-wise AUROC of 0.995. To provide actionable insights, a quality report scorecard was developed to quantify high-quality image patches and visualize artifact distributions. This research showcases the effectiveness of utilizing advanced technologies like deep learning in improving the quality and accuracy of digital histopathology. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In modern cancer diagnostics, Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) is widely used to digitize tissue specimens for detailed, high-resolution examination; however, other diagnostic approaches, such as liquid biopsy and molecular testing, are also utilized based on the cancer type and clinical context. While WSI has revolutionized digital histopathology by enabling automated, precise analysis, it remains vulnerable to artifacts introduced during slide preparation and scanning. These artifacts can compromise downstream image analysis. To address this challenge, we propose and compare three robust artifact detection approaches for WSIs: (1) a foundation model-based approach (FMA) using a fine-tuned Unified Neural Image (UNI) architecture, (2) a deep learning approach (DLA) built on a ResNet50 backbone, and (3) a knowledge-based approach (KBA) leveraging handcrafted features from texture, color, and frequency-based metrics. The methods target six common artifact types: tissue folds, out-of-focus regions, air bubbles, tissue damage, marker traces, and blood contamination. Evaluations were conducted on 50,000+ image patches from diverse scanners (Hamamatsu, Philips, Leica Aperio AT2) across multiple sites. The FMA achieved the highest patch-wise AUROC of 0.995 (95% CI [0.994, 0.995]), outperforming the ResNet50-based method (AUROC: 0.977, 95% CI [0.977, 0.978]) and the KBA (AUROC: 0.940, 95% CI [0.933, 0.946]). To translate detection into actionable insights, we developed a quality report scorecard that quantifies high-quality patches and visualizes artifact distributions.

Summary:
The article explores the performance of agentic Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-03 in challenging detective tasks. While MLLMs excel in expert-level tasks, they struggle in scenarios like CaughtCheating where subtle clues must be detected from images. The study identifies the limitations of existing MLLMs in handling such tasks, emphasizing the need for enhanced visual perception and reasoning capabilities. By investigating the CaughtCheating scenario, the research aims to bridge the gap between MLLMs and human detective abilities, offering valuable insights for practical usage. Success in these challenging tasks could enable MLLMs to achieve human-level detective skills, providing a new avenue for advancing artificial intelligence in perception and reasoning. <div>

Abstract: Recent agentic Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) such as GPT-o3 have achieved near-ceiling scores on various existing benchmarks, motivating a demand for more challenging test tasks. These MLLMs have been reported to excel in a few expert-level tasks for humans, e.g., GeoGuesser, reflecting their potential as a detective who can notice minuscule cues in an image and weave them into coherent, situational explanations, leading to a reliable answer. But can they match the performance of excellent human detectives? To answer this question, we investigate some hard scenarios where GPT-o3 can still handle, and find a common scenario where o3's performance drops to nearly zero, which we name CaughtCheating. It is inspired by the social media requests that ask others to detect suspicious clues from photos shared by the poster's partner. We conduct extensive experiments and analysis to understand why existing MLLMs lack sufficient capability to solve this kind of task. CaughtCheating provides a class of challenging visual perception and reasoning tasks with great value and practical usage. Success in these tasks paves the way for MLLMs to acquire human-level detective perception and reasoning capabilities.

The article introduces VSF--Med, a framework for evaluating the security of Vision Language Models (VLMs) in medical imaging. It includes text-prompt attack templates, imperceptible visual perturbations, and a rubric for vulnerability scoring. VSF--Med allows for the benchmarking of medical VLMs using over 30,000 adversarial variants from radiology images. The analysis shows shifts in z-score values for persistence of attack effects, prompt injection effectiveness, and safety bypass success across VLMs. Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct exhibits the highest vulnerability increase in persistence of attack effects, while GPT-4o shows vulnerability increases in both persistence of attack effects and prompt injection attacks. The framework aims to streamline labor-intensive medical imaging workflows and enhance the security evaluation of VLMs in clinical settings.<br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) hold great promise for streamlining labour-intensive medical imaging workflows, yet systematic security evaluations in clinical settings remain scarce. We introduce VSF--Med, an end-to-end vulnerability-scoring framework for medical VLMs that unites three novel components: (i) a rich library of sophisticated text-prompt attack templates targeting emerging threat vectors; (ii) imperceptible visual perturbations calibrated by structural similarity (SSIM) thresholds to preserve clinical realism; and (iii) an eight-dimensional rubric evaluated by two independent judge LLMs, whose raw scores are consolidated via z-score normalization to yield a 0--32 composite risk metric. Built entirely on publicly available datasets and accompanied by open-source code, VSF--Med synthesizes over 30,000 adversarial variants from 5,000 radiology images and enables reproducible benchmarking of any medical VLM with a single command. Our consolidated analysis reports mean z-score shifts of $0.90\sigma$ for persistence-of-attack-effects, $0.74\sigma$ for prompt-injection effectiveness, and $0.63\sigma$ for safety-bypass success across state-of-the-art VLMs. Notably, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct exhibits a peak vulnerability increase of $1.29\sigma$ for persistence-of-attack-effects, while GPT-4o shows increases of $0.69\sigma$ for that same vector and $0.28\sigma$ for prompt-injection attacks.

<div> Keywords: code generation, natural language specifications, Large Language Models, incoherence, error estimation<br />
Summary:<br />
Generating code from natural language specifications using Large Language Models (LLMs) has been successful, but LLMs often produce factually incorrect outputs. This paper introduces a measure of incorrectness called incoherence, which estimates the probability of generated code being incorrect without an existing correct implementation. The proposed methodology efficiently identifies incorrect programs and can replace oracle-based evaluation of LLMs with high reliability. Experiments show that the incoherence-based evaluation can identify about two-thirds of incorrect programs without false positives. The ranking of LLMs based on correctness assessment by an oracle is strongly correlated with the ranking based on incoherence evaluation. This approach provides a valuable tool for assessing the accuracy of code generated by LLMs in the absence of an oracle.<br /> 
Summary: <div>

Abstract: Generating code from natural language specifications is one of the most successful applications of Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet, they hallucinate: LLMs produce outputs that may be grammatically correct but are factually incorrect. Without an existing, correct implementation (i.e., an oracle), can we quantify how likely the generated program is correct?
  In this paper, we propose a measure of incorrectness, called incoherence, that can be estimated efficiently in the absence of an oracle and provides a lower bound on the error, i.e., the probability that the LLM-generated program for that specification is incorrect. Our experiments demonstrate an extraordinary effectiveness. For the average code generation task, our incoherence-based methodology can automatically identify about two-thirds of incorrect programs without reports of false positives. In fact, an oracle-based evaluation of LLMs can be reliably replaced by an incoherence-based evaluation. In particular, we find a very strong agreement between the ranking of LLMs by the number of programs deemed correct via an oracle (pass@1) and the ranking of LLMs by the number of programs deemed correct via our incoherence.

Abstract: This paper introduces Smooth-Distill, a novel self-distillation framework designed to simultaneously perform human activity recognition (HAR) and sensor placement detection using wearable sensor data. The proposed approach utilizes a unified CNN-based architecture, MTL-net, which processes accelerometer data and branches into two outputs for each respective task. Unlike conventional distillation methods that require separate teacher and student models, the proposed framework utilizes a smoothed, historical version of the model itself as the teacher, significantly reducing training computational overhead while maintaining performance benefits. To support this research, we developed a comprehensive accelerometer-based dataset capturing 12 distinct sleep postures across three different wearing positions, complementing two existing public datasets (MHealth and WISDM). Experimental results show that Smooth-Distill consistently outperforms alternative approaches across different evaluation scenarios, achieving notable improvements in both human activity recognition and device placement detection tasks. This method demonstrates enhanced stability in convergence patterns during training and exhibits reduced overfitting compared to traditional multitask learning baselines. This framework contributes to the practical implementation of knowledge distillation in human activity recognition systems, offering an effective solution for multitask learning with accelerometer data that balances accuracy and training efficiency. More broadly, it reduces the computational cost of model training, which is critical for scenarios requiring frequent model updates or training on resource-constrained platforms.

Abstract: Human reliability remains a critical concern in safety-critical domains such as nuclear power, where operational failures are often linked to human error. While conventional human reliability analysis (HRA) methods have been widely adopted, they rely heavily on expert judgment for identifying human failure events (HFEs) and assigning performance influencing factors (PIFs). This reliance introduces challenges related to reproducibility, subjectivity, and limited integration of interface-level data. In particular, current approaches lack the capacity to rigorously assess how human-machine interface design contributes to operator performance variability and error susceptibility. To address these limitations, this study proposes a framework for risk-informed human failure event identification and interface-induced risk assessment driven by AutoGraph (InSight-R). By linking empirical behavioral data to the interface-embedded knowledge graph (IE-KG) constructed by the automated graph-based execution framework (AutoGraph), the InSight-R framework enables automated HFE identification based on both error-prone and time-deviated operational paths. Furthermore, we discuss the relationship between designer-user conflicts and human error. The results demonstrate that InSight-R not only enhances the objectivity and interpretability of HFE identification but also provides a scalable pathway toward dynamic, real-time human reliability assessment in digitalized control environments. This framework offers actionable insights for interface design optimization and contributes to the advancement of mechanism-driven HRA methodologies.

Abstract: While multi-modal learning has advanced significantly, current approaches often treat modalities separately, creating inconsistencies in representation and reasoning. We introduce MANTA (Multi-modal Abstraction and Normalization via Textual Alignment), a theoretically-grounded framework that unifies visual and auditory inputs into a structured textual space for seamless processing with large language models. MANTA addresses four key challenges: (1) semantic alignment across modalities with information-theoretic optimization, (2) adaptive temporal synchronization for varying information densities, (3) hierarchical content representation for multi-scale understanding, and (4) context-aware retrieval of sparse information from long sequences. We formalize our approach within a rigorous mathematical framework, proving its optimality for context selection under token constraints. Extensive experiments on the challenging task of Long Video Question Answering show that MANTA improves state-of-the-art models by up to 22.6% in overall accuracy, with particularly significant gains (27.3%) on videos exceeding 30 minutes. Additionally, we demonstrate MANTA's superiority on temporal reasoning tasks (23.8% improvement) and cross-modal understanding (25.1% improvement). Our framework introduces novel density estimation techniques for redundancy minimization while preserving rare signals, establishing new foundations for unifying multimodal representations through structured text.

Abstract: Plant diseases pose significant challenges to farmers and the agricultural sector at large. However, early detection of plant diseases is crucial to mitigating their effects and preventing widespread damage, as outbreaks can severely impact the productivity and quality of crops. With advancements in technology, there are increasing opportunities for automating the monitoring and detection of disease outbreaks in plants. This study proposed a system designed to identify and monitor plant diseases using a transfer learning approach. Specifically, the study utilizes YOLOv7 and YOLOv8, two state-ofthe-art models in the field of object detection. By fine-tuning these models on a dataset of plant leaf images, the system is able to accurately detect the presence of Bacteria, Fungi and Viral diseases such as Powdery Mildew, Angular Leaf Spot, Early blight and Tomato mosaic virus. The model's performance was evaluated using several metrics, including mean Average Precision (mAP), F1-score, Precision, and Recall, yielding values of 91.05, 89.40, 91.22, and 87.66, respectively. The result demonstrates the superior effectiveness and efficiency of YOLOv8 compared to other object detection methods, highlighting its potential for use in modern agricultural practices. The approach provides a scalable, automated solution for early any plant disease detection, contributing to enhanced crop yield, reduced reliance on manual monitoring, and supporting sustainable agricultural practices.

<title>Theoretical Modeling of LLM Self-Improvement Training Dynamics Through Solver-Verifier Gap</title>

Abstract: Self-improvement is among the most prominent techniques within the realm of large language models (LLM), aiming to enhance the LLM performance without relying on external data. Despite its significance, generally how LLM performances evolve during the self-improvement process remains underexplored. In this paper, we theoretically model the training dynamics of self-improvement via the concept of solver-verifier gap. This is inspired by the conjecture that the performance enhancement of self-improvement stems from the gap between LLM's solver capability and verifier capability. Based on the theoretical framework, we further introduce how to predict the ultimate power of self-improvement using only information from the first few training epochs. We empirically validate the effectiveness of the theoretical model on various LLMs and datasets. Beyond self-improvement, we extend our analysis to investigate how external data influences these dynamics within the framework. Notably, we find that under limited external data regimes, such external data can be utilized at any stage without significantly affecting final performances, which accords with the empirical observations.

<title>The language of time: a language model perspective on time-series foundation models</title>

Abstract: With the rise of large language models, the paradigm of training foundation models with massive parameter counts on vast datasets has been adopted in multiple domains to achieve remarkable success. Time series foundation models represent a significant extension of this paradigm, demonstrating exceptional expressive power, generalization, and cross-domain transferability. However, this gives rise to a fundamental paradox: time series data reflect distinct dynamical systems, making cross-domain transfer intuitively implausible, yet this is contradicted by the models' empirical success. To resolve this paradox, this paper investigates, from both theoretical and experimental perspectives, the representation learning mechanisms and generalization capabilities of patch-based time series foundation models. We argue that such models are not merely applying a new architecture but are fundamentally generalizing the representation paradigm of language models by extending deterministic vector-based representations to latent probabilistic distributional forms. Our theoretical analysis supports this framework by demonstrating that continuous time-series patches can be faithfully quantized into a discrete vocabulary whose key statistical properties are highly consistent with those of natural language. This generalization allows time series models to inherit the robust representation and transfer abilities of large language models, thereby explaining their superior performance in temporal tasks. Ultimately, our work provides a rigorous theoretical cornerstone for understanding, evaluating, and improving the safety and reliability of large-scale time series foundation models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled powerful advances in natural language understanding and generation. Yet their application to complex, real-world scientific workflows remain limited by challenges in memory, planning, and tool integration. Here, we introduce SciBORG (Scientific Bespoke Artificial Intelligence Agents Optimized for Research Goals), a modular agentic framework that allows LLM-based agents to autonomously plan, reason, and achieve robust and reliable domain-specific task execution. Agents are constructed dynamically from source code documentation and augmented with finite-state automata (FSA) memory, enabling persistent state tracking and context-aware decision-making. This approach eliminates the need for manual prompt engineering and allows for robust, scalable deployment across diverse applications via maintaining context across extended workflows and to recover from tool or execution failures. We validate SciBORG through integration with both physical and virtual hardware, such as microwave synthesizers for executing user-specified reactions, with context-aware decision making and demonstrate its use in autonomous multi-step bioassay retrieval from the PubChem database utilizing multi-step planning, reasoning, agent-to-agent communication and coordination for execution of exploratory tasks. Systematic benchmarking shows that SciBORG agents achieve reliable execution, adaptive planning, and interpretable state transitions. Our results show that memory and state awareness are critical enablers of agentic planning and reliability, offering a generalizable foundation for deploying AI agents in complex environments.

<title>Federated Learning-Enabled Hybrid Language Models for Communication-Efficient Token Transmission</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00082</link>

Abstract: Hybrid Language Models (HLMs) combine the low-latency efficiency of Small Language Models (SLMs) on edge devices with the high accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) on centralized servers. Unlike traditional end-to-end LLM inference, HLMs reduce latency and communication by invoking LLMs only when local SLM predictions are uncertain, i.e., when token-level confidence is low or entropy is high. However, ambiguous or low-confidence predictions still require frequent offloading to the LLM, leading to significant communication overhead in bandwidth-constrained settings. To address this, we propose FedHLM, a communication-efficient HLM framework that integrates uncertainty-aware inference with Federated Learning (FL). FedHLM's key innovation lies in collaboratively learning token-level uncertainty thresholds that govern when LLM assistance is needed. Rather than using static or manually tuned thresholds, FedHLM employs FL to optimize these thresholds in a privacy-preserving, distributed manner. Additionally, it leverages embedding-based token representations for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) resolution, enabling clients to reuse tokens inferred by semantically similar peers without engaging the LLM. We further introduce hierarchical model aggregation: edge servers refine local routing policies through client updates, while cross-cluster coordination aligns global decision boundaries. This layered design captures recurring uncertainty patterns, reducing redundant LLM queries. Experiments on large-scale news classification tasks show that FedHLM reduces LLM transmissions by over 95 percent with negligible accuracy loss, making it well-suited for scalable and efficient edge-AI applications.

Abstract: This study addresses the lack of structured causal modeling between tactical strike behavior and strategic delay in current strategic-level simulations, particularly the structural bottlenecks in capturing intermediate variables within the "resilience - nodal suppression - negotiation window" chain. We propose the Intervention-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (IA-STGNN), a novel framework that closes the causal loop from tactical input to strategic delay output. The model integrates graph attention mechanisms, counterfactual simulation units, and spatial intervention node reconstruction to enable dynamic simulations of strike configurations and synchronization strategies. Training data are generated from a multi-physics simulation platform (GEANT4 + COMSOL) under NIST SP 800-160 standards, ensuring structural traceability and policy-level validation. Experimental results demonstrate that IA-STGNN significantly outperforms baseline models (ST-GNN, GCN-LSTM, XGBoost), achieving a 12.8 percent reduction in MAE and 18.4 percent increase in Top-5 percent accuracy, while improving causal path consistency and intervention stability. IA-STGNN enables interpretable prediction of strategic delay and supports applications such as nuclear deterrence simulation, diplomatic window assessment, and multi-strategy optimization, providing a structured and transparent AI decision-support mechanism for high-level policy modeling.

Abstract: Accurate traffic prediction is essential for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), yet current methods struggle with the inherent complexity and non-linearity of traffic dynamics, making it difficult to integrate spatial and temporal characteristics. Furthermore, existing approaches use static techniques to address non-stationary and anomalous historical data, which limits adaptability and undermines data smoothing. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Graph Fusion Enhanced Network (GFEN), an innovative framework for network-level traffic speed prediction. GFEN introduces a novel topological spatiotemporal graph fusion technique that meticulously extracts and merges spatial and temporal correlations from both data distribution and network topology using trainable methods, enabling the modeling of multi-scale spatiotemporal features. Additionally, GFEN employs a hybrid methodology combining a k-th order difference-based mathematical framework with an attention-based deep learning structure to adaptively smooth historical observations and dynamically mitigate data anomalies and non-stationarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GFEN surpasses state-of-the-art methods by approximately 6.3% in prediction accuracy and exhibits convergence rates nearly twice as fast as recent hybrid models, confirming its superior performance and potential to significantly enhance traffic prediction system efficiency.

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced mass spectrometry data interpretation, yet most models remain feature extractors rather than unified scoring frameworks. We present pUniFind, the first large-scale multimodal pre-trained model in proteomics that integrates end-to-end peptide-spectrum scoring with open, zero-shot de novo sequencing. Trained on over 100 million open search-derived spectra, pUniFind aligns spectral and peptide modalities via cross modality prediction and outperforms traditional engines across diverse datasets, particularly achieving a 42.6 percent increase in the number of identified peptides in immunopeptidomics. Supporting over 1,300 modifications, pUniFind identifies 60 percent more PSMs than existing de novo methods despite a 300-fold larger search space. A deep learning based quality control module further recovers 38.5 percent additional peptides including 1,891 mapped to the genome but absent from reference proteomes while preserving full fragment ion coverage. These results establish a unified, scalable deep learning framework for proteomic analysis, offering improved sensitivity, modification coverage, and interpretability.

Abstract: Humans increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) to support decisions in social settings. Previous work suggests that such tools shape people's moral and political judgements. However, the long-term implications of LLM-based social decision-making remain unknown. How will human cooperation be affected when the assessment of social interactions relies on language models? This is a pressing question, as human cooperation is often driven by indirect reciprocity, reputations, and the capacity to judge interactions of others. Here, we assess how state-of-the-art LLMs judge cooperative actions. We provide 21 different LLMs with an extensive set of examples where individuals cooperate -- or refuse cooperating -- in a range of social contexts, and ask how these interactions should be judged. Furthermore, through an evolutionary game-theoretical model, we evaluate cooperation dynamics in populations where the extracted LLM-driven judgements prevail, assessing the long-term impact of LLMs on human prosociality. We observe a remarkable agreement in evaluating cooperation against good opponents. On the other hand, we notice within- and between-model variance when judging cooperation with ill-reputed individuals. We show that the differences revealed between models can significantly impact the prevalence of cooperation. Finally, we test prompts to steer LLM norms, showing that such interventions can shape LLM judgements, particularly through goal-oriented prompts. Our research connects LLM-based advices and long-term social dynamics, and highlights the need to carefully align LLM norms in order to preserve human cooperation.

Abstract: Allocation of personnel and material resources is highly sensible in the case of firefighter interventions. This allocation relies on simulations to experiment with various scenarios. The main objective of this allocation is the global optimization of the firefighters response. Data generation is then mandatory to study various scenarios In this study, we propose to compare different data generation methods. Methods such as Random Sampling, Tabular Variational Autoencoders, standard Generative Adversarial Networks, Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Probabilistic Models are examined to ascertain their efficacy in capturing the intricacies of firefighter interventions. Traditional evaluation metrics often fall short in capturing the nuanced requirements of synthetic datasets for real-world scenarios. To address this gap, an evaluation of synthetic data quality is conducted using a combination of domain-specific metrics tailored to the firefighting domain and standard measures such as the Wasserstein distance. Domain-specific metrics include response time distribution, spatial-temporal distribution of interventions, and accidents representation. These metrics are designed to assess data variability, the preservation of fine and complex correlations and anomalies such as event with a very low occurrence, the conformity with the initial statistical distribution and the operational relevance of the synthetic data. The distribution has the particularity of being highly unbalanced, none of the variables following a Gaussian distribution, adding complexity to the data generation process.

Abstract: Maximal Ancestral Graphs (MAGs) provide an abstract representation of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) with latent (selection) variables. These graphical objects encode information about ancestral relations and d-separations of the DAGs they represent. This abstract representation has been used amongst others to prove the soundness and completeness of the FCI algorithm for causal discovery, and to derive a do-calculus for its output. One significant inherent limitation of MAGs is that they rule out the possibility of cyclic causal relationships. In this work, we address that limitation. We introduce and study a class of graphical objects that we coin ''$\sigma$-Maximal Ancestral Graphs'' (''$\sigma$-MAGs''). We show how these graphs provide an abstract representation of (possibly cyclic) Directed Graphs (DGs) with latent (selection) variables, analogously to how MAGs represent DAGs. We study the properties of these objects and provide a characterization of their Markov equivalence classes.

Abstract: Despite growing interest in process analysis and mining for data-aware specifications, alignment-based conformance checking for declarative process models has focused on pure control-flow specifications, or mild data-aware extensions limited to numerical data and variable-to-constant comparisons. This is not surprising: finding alignments is computationally hard, even more so in the presence of data dependencies. In this paper, we challenge this problem in the case where the reference model is captured using data-aware Declare with general data types and data conditions. We show that, unexpectedly, it is possible to compute data-aware optimal alignments in this rich setting, enjoying at once efficiency and expressiveness. This is achieved by carefully combining the two best-known approaches to deal with control flow and data dependencies when computing alignments, namely A* search and SMT solving. Specifically, we introduce a novel algorithmic technique that efficiently explores the search space, generating descendant states through the application of repair actions aiming at incrementally resolving constraint violations. We prove the correctness of our algorithm and experimentally show its efficiency. The evaluation witnesses that our approach matches or surpasses the performance of the state of the art while also supporting significantly more expressive data dependencies, showcasing its potential to support real-world applications.

Abstract: Alternative Assets tokenization is transforming non-traditional financial instruments are represented and traded on the web. However, ensuring trustworthiness in web-based tokenized ecosystems poses significant challenges, from verifying off-chain asset data to enforcing regulatory compliance. This paper proposes an AI-governed agent architecture that integrates intelligent agents with blockchain to achieve web-trustworthy tokenization of alternative assets. In the proposed architecture, autonomous agents orchestrate the tokenization process (asset verification, valuation, compliance checking, and lifecycle management), while an AI-driven governance layer monitors agent behavior and enforces trust through adaptive policies and cryptoeconomic incentives. We demonstrate that this approach enhances transparency, security, and compliance in asset tokenization, addressing key concerns around data authenticity and fraud. A case study on tokenizing real estate assets illustrates how the architecture mitigates risks (e.g., fraudulent listings and money laundering) through real-time AI anomaly detection and on-chain enforcement. Our evaluation and analysis suggest that combining AI governance with multi-agent systems and blockchain can significantly bolster trust in tokenized asset ecosystems. This work offers a novel framework for trustworthy asset tokenization on the web and provides insights for practitioners aiming to deploy secure, compliant tokenization platforms.

<title>Towards transparent and data-driven fault detection in manufacturing: A case study on univariate, discrete time series</title>

Abstract: Ensuring consistent product quality in modern manufacturing is crucial, particularly in safety-critical applications. Conventional quality control approaches, reliant on manually defined thresholds and features, lack adaptability to the complexity and variability inherent in production data and necessitate extensive domain expertise. Conversely, data-driven methods, such as machine learning, demonstrate high detection performance but typically function as black-box models, thereby limiting their acceptance in industrial environments where interpretability is paramount. This paper introduces a methodology for industrial fault detection, which is both data-driven and transparent. The approach integrates a supervised machine learning model for multi-class fault classification, Shapley Additive Explanations for post-hoc interpretability, and a do-main-specific visualisation technique that maps model explanations to operator-interpretable features. Furthermore, the study proposes an evaluation methodology that assesses model explanations through quantitative perturbation analysis and evaluates visualisations by qualitative expert assessment. The approach was applied to the crimping process, a safety-critical joining technique, using a dataset of univariate, discrete time series. The system achieves a fault detection accuracy of 95.9 %, and both quantitative selectivity analysis and qualitative expert evaluations confirmed the relevance and inter-pretability of the generated explanations. This human-centric approach is designed to enhance trust and interpretability in data-driven fault detection, thereby contributing to applied system design in industrial quality control.

Abstract: Computer programming is undergoing a true transformation driven by powerful new tools for automatic source code generation based on large language models. This transformation is also manifesting in introductory programming courses at universities around the world, generating an in-depth debate about how programming content should be taught, learned, and assessed in the context of generative artificial intelligence.
  This article aims, on the one hand, to review the most relevant studies on this issue, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages identified in the specialized literature. On the other hand, it proposes enriching teaching and learning methodologies by focusing on code comprehension and execution rather than on mere coding or program functionality. In particular, it advocates for the use of visual representations of code and visual simulations of its execution as effective tools for teaching, learning, and assessing programming, thus fostering a deeper understanding among students.
  Finally, the opinions of students who took the object-oriented programming course are presented to provide preliminary context supporting the incorporation of visual simulations in Java (or other languages) as part of the training process.

Abstract: AI-Hybrid TRNG is a deep-learning framework that extracts near-uniform entropy directly from physical noise, eliminating the need for bulky quantum devices or expensive laboratory-grade RF receivers. Instead, it relies on a low-cost, thumb-sized RF front end, plus CPU-timing jitter, for training, and then emits 32-bit high-entropy streams without any quantization step.
  Unlike deterministic or trained artificial intelligence random number generators (RNGs), our dynamic inner-outer network couples adaptive natural sources and reseeding, yielding truly unpredictable and autonomous sequences. Generated numbers pass the NIST SP 800-22 battery better than a CPU-based method. It also passes nineteen bespoke statistical tests for both bit- and integer-level analysis. All results satisfy cryptographic standards, while forward and backward prediction experiments reveal no exploitable biases. The model's footprint is below 0.5 MB, making it deployable on MCUs and FPGA soft cores, as well as suitable for other resource-constrained platforms.
  By detaching randomness quality from dedicated hardware, AI-Hybrid TRNG broadens the reach of high-integrity random number generators across secure systems, cryptographic protocols, embedded and edge devices, stochastic simulations, and server applications that need randomness.

Abstract: Political polarization undermines democratic civic education by exacerbating identity-based resistance to opposing viewpoints. Emerging AI technologies offer new opportunities to advance interventions that reduce polarization and promote political open-mindedness. We examined novel design strategies that leverage adaptive and emotionally-responsive civic narratives that may sustain students' emotional engagement in stories, and in turn, promote perspective-taking toward members of political out-groups. Drawing on theories from political psychology and narratology, we investigate how affective computing techniques can support three storytelling mechanisms: transportation into a story world, identification with characters, and interaction with the storyteller. Using a design-based research (DBR) approach, we iteratively developed and refined an AI-mediated Digital Civic Storytelling (AI-DCS) platform. Our prototype integrates facial emotion recognition and attention tracking to assess users' affective and attentional states in real time. Narrative content is organized around pre-structured story outlines, with beat-by-beat language adaptation implemented via GPT-4, personalizing linguistic tone to sustain students' emotional engagement in stories that center political perspectives different from their own. Our work offers a foundation for AI-supported, emotionally-sensitive strategies that address affective polarization while preserving learner autonomy. We conclude with implications for civic education interventions, algorithmic literacy, and HCI challenges associated with AI dialogue management and affect-adaptive learning environments.

Abstract: Recent research shows how diffusion models can unconditionally generate tile-based game levels, but use of diffusion models for text-to-level generation is underexplored. There are practical considerations for creating a usable model: caption/level pairs are needed, as is a text embedding model, and a way of generating entire playable levels, rather than individual scenes. We present strategies to automatically assign descriptive captions to an existing level dataset, and train diffusion models using both pretrained text encoders and simple transformer models trained from scratch. Captions are automatically assigned to generated levels so that the degree of overlap between input and output captions can be compared. We also assess the diversity and playability of the resulting levels. Results are compared with an unconditional diffusion model and a generative adversarial network, as well as the text-to-level approaches Five-Dollar Model and MarioGPT. Notably, the best diffusion model uses a simple transformer model for text embedding, and takes less time to train than diffusion models employing more complex text encoders, indicating that reliance on larger language models is not necessary. We also present a GUI allowing designers to construct long levels from model-generated scenes.

Abstract: Current artificial intelligence models for medical imaging are predominantly single modality and single disease. Attempts to create multimodal and multi-disease models have resulted in inconsistent clinical accuracy. Furthermore, training these models typically requires large, labour-intensive, well-labelled datasets. We developed MerMED-FM, a state-of-the-art multimodal, multi-specialty foundation model trained using self-supervised learning and a memory module. MerMED-FM was trained on 3.3 million medical images from over ten specialties and seven modalities, including computed tomography (CT), chest X-rays (CXR), ultrasound (US), pathology patches, color fundus photography (CFP), optical coherence tomography (OCT) and dermatology images. MerMED-FM was evaluated across multiple diseases and compared against existing foundational models. Strong performance was achieved across all modalities, with AUROCs of 0.988 (OCT); 0.982 (pathology); 0.951 (US); 0.943 (CT); 0.931 (skin); 0.894 (CFP); 0.858 (CXR).

Abstract: Wearable devices record physiological and behavioral signals that can improve health predictions. While foundation models are increasingly used for such predictions, they have been primarily applied to low-level sensor data, despite behavioral data often being more informative due to their alignment with physiologically relevant timescales and quantities. We develop foundation models of such behavioral signals using over 2.5B hours of wearable data from 162K individuals, systematically optimizing architectures and tokenization strategies for this unique dataset. Evaluated on 57 health-related tasks, our model shows strong performance across diverse real-world applications including individual-level classification and time-varying health state prediction. The model excels in behavior-driven tasks like sleep prediction, and improves further when combined with representations of raw sensor data. These results underscore the importance of tailoring foundation model design to wearables and demonstrate the potential to enable new health applications.

<title>What Makes Local Updates Effective: The Role of Data Heterogeneity and Smoothness</title>

Abstract: This thesis contributes to the theoretical understanding of local update algorithms, especially Local SGD, in distributed and federated optimization under realistic models of data heterogeneity. A central focus is on the bounded second-order heterogeneity assumption, which is shown to be both necessary and sufficient for local updates to outperform centralized or mini-batch methods in convex and non-convex settings. The thesis establishes tight upper and lower bounds in several regimes for various local update algorithms and characterizes the min-max complexity of multiple problem classes. At its core is a fine-grained consensus-error-based analysis framework that yields sharper finite-time convergence bounds under third-order smoothness and relaxed heterogeneity assumptions. The thesis also extends to online federated learning, providing fundamental regret bounds under both first-order and bandit feedback. Together, these results clarify when and why local updates offer provable advantages, and the thesis serves as a self-contained guide for analyzing Local SGD in heterogeneous environments.

Abstract: High-resolution imaging is crucial for enhancing visual clarity and enabling precise computer-assisted guidance in minimally invasive surgery (MIS). Despite the increasing adoption of 4K endoscopic systems, there remains a significant gap in publicly available native 4K datasets tailored specifically for robotic-assisted MIS. We introduce SurgiSR4K, the first publicly accessible surgical imaging and video dataset captured at a native 4K resolution, representing realistic conditions of robotic-assisted procedures. SurgiSR4K comprises diverse visual scenarios including specular reflections, tool occlusions, bleeding, and soft tissue deformations, meticulously designed to reflect common challenges faced during laparoscopic and robotic surgeries. This dataset opens up possibilities for a broad range of computer vision tasks that might benefit from high resolution data, such as super resolution (SR), smoke removal, surgical instrument detection, 3D tissue reconstruction, monocular depth estimation, instance segmentation, novel view synthesis, and vision-language model (VLM) development. SurgiSR4K provides a robust foundation for advancing research in high-resolution surgical imaging and fosters the development of intelligent imaging technologies aimed at enhancing performance, safety, and usability in image-guided robotic surgeries.

<title>Two-Stage Reasoning-Infused Learning: Improving Classification with LLM-Generated Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Standard classification models often map inputs directly to labels without explicit reasoning, potentially limiting their performance, robustness, and interpretability. This paper introduces a novel two-stage approach to enhance text classification by leveraging Large Language Model (LLM)-generated reasonings. In the first stage, we fine-tune a Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct model (henceforth Llama-R-Gen) on a general-purpose reasoning dataset (syvai/reasoning-gen) to generate textual reasoning (R) given a question and its answer. In the second stage, this generally trained Llama-R-Gen is used offline to create an augmented training dataset for a downstream generative model. This downstream model, based on Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, takes only the input text (Q) and is trained to output the generated reasoning (R) immediately followed by the predicted emotion (A). We demonstrate this methodology on the dair-ai/emotion dataset for emotion classification. Our experiments show that the generative model trained to output reasoning and the emotion (Classifier Q->RA) achieves a significant improvement of 8.7 percentage points in accuracy (for emotion prediction) compared to a baseline generative model trained solely to output the emotion (Classifier Q->A), highlighting the strong generalization capabilities of the reasoning generation and the benefit of explicit reasoning training. This work underscores the potential of LLM-generated reasonings for creating richer training datasets, thereby improving the performance of diverse downstream NLP tasks and providing explicit explanations.

Abstract: This paper presents a search for underlying analytic structures among the fundamental parameters of the Standard Model (SM) using symbolic regression and genetic programming. We identify the simplest analytic relationships connecting pairs of these constants and report several notable observations based on about a thousand expressions with relative precision better than 1%. These results may serve as valuable inputs for model builders and artificial intelligence methods aimed at uncovering hidden patterns among the SM constants, or potentially used as building blocks for a deeper underlying law that connects all parameters of the SM through a small set of fundamental constants.

<title>Investigating Stochastic Methods for Prosody Modeling in Speech Synthesis</title>

Abstract: While generative methods have progressed rapidly in recent years, generating expressive prosody for an utterance remains a challenging task in text-to-speech synthesis. This is particularly true for systems that model prosody explicitly through parameters such as pitch, energy, and duration, which is commonly done for the sake of interpretability and controllability. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of stochastic methods for this task, including Normalizing Flows, Conditional Flow Matching, and Rectified Flows. We compare these methods to a traditional deterministic baseline, as well as to real human realizations. Our extensive subjective and objective evaluations demonstrate that stochastic methods produce natural prosody on par with human speakers by capturing the variability inherent in human speech. Further, they open up additional controllability options by allowing the sampling temperature to be tuned.

Abstract: Speech super-resolution (SSR) enhances low-resolution speech by increasing the sampling rate. While most SSR methods focus on magnitude reconstruction, recent research highlights the importance of phase reconstruction for improved perceptual quality. Therefore, we introduce CTFT-Net, a Complex Time-Frequency Transformation Network that reconstructs both magnitude and phase in complex domains for improved SSR tasks. It incorporates a complex global attention block to model inter-phoneme and inter-frequency dependencies and a complex conformer to capture long-range and local features, improving frequency reconstruction and noise robustness. CTFT-Net employs time-domain and multi-resolution frequency-domain loss functions for better generalization. Experiments show CTFT-Net outperforms state-of-the-art models (NU-Wave, WSRGlow, NVSR, AERO) on the VCTK dataset, particularly for extreme upsampling (2 kHz to 48 kHz), reconstructing high frequencies effectively without noisy artifacts.

<title>Interpretable AI for Time-Series: Multi-Model Heatmap Fusion with Global Attention and NLP-Generated Explanations</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for enhancing model interpretability by integrating heatmaps produced separately by ResNet and a restructured 2D Transformer with globally weighted input saliency. We address the critical problem of spatial-temporal misalignment in existing interpretability methods, where convolutional networks fail to capture global context and Transformers lack localized precision - a limitation that impedes actionable insights in safety-critical domains like healthcare and industrial monitoring. Our method merges gradient-weighted activation maps (ResNet) and Transformer attention rollout into a unified visualization, achieving full spatial-temporal alignment while preserving real-time performance. Empirical evaluations on clinical (ECG arrhythmia detection) and industrial (energy consumption prediction) datasets demonstrate significant improvements: the hybrid framework achieves 94.1% accuracy (F1 0.93) on the PhysioNet dataset and reduces regression error to RMSE = 0.28 kWh (R2 = 0.95) on the UCI Energy Appliance dataset-outperforming standalone ResNet, Transformer, and InceptionTime baselines by 3.8-12.4%. An NLP module translates fused heatmaps into domain-specific narratives (e.g., "Elevated ST-segment between 2-4 seconds suggests myocardial ischemia"), validated via BLEU-4 (0.586) and ROUGE-L (0.650) scores. By formalizing interpretability as causal fidelity and spatial-temporal alignment, our approach bridges the gap between technical outputs and stakeholder understanding, offering a scalable solution for transparent, time-aware decision-making.

<title>Linearly Decoding Refused Knowledge in Aligned Language Models</title>

Abstract: Most commonly used language models (LMs) are instruction-tuned and aligned using a combination of fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, causing them to refuse users requests deemed harmful by the model. However, jailbreak prompts can often bypass these refusal mechanisms and elicit harmful responses. In this work, we study the extent to which information accessed via jailbreak prompts is decodable using linear probes trained on LM hidden states. We show that a great deal of initially refused information is linearly decodable. For example, across models, the response of a jailbroken LM for the average IQ of a country can be predicted by a linear probe with Pearson correlations exceeding $0.8$. Surprisingly, we find that probes trained on base models (which do not refuse) sometimes transfer to their instruction-tuned versions and are capable of revealing information that jailbreaks decode generatively, suggesting that the internal representations of many refused properties persist from base LMs through instruction-tuning. Importantly, we show that this information is not merely "leftover" in instruction-tuned models, but is actively used by them: we find that probe-predicted values correlate with LM generated pairwise comparisons, indicating that the information decoded by our probes align with suppressed generative behavior that may be expressed more subtly in other downstream tasks. Overall, our results suggest that instruction-tuning does not wholly eliminate or even relocate harmful information in representation space-they merely suppress its direct expression, leaving it both linearly accessible and indirectly influential in downstream behavior.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for real-time sign language recognition using lightweight DNNs trained on limited data. Our system addresses key challenges in sign language recognition, including data scarcity, high computational costs, and discrepancies in frame rates between training and inference environments. By encoding sign language specific parameters, such as handshape, palm orientation, movement, and location into vectorized inputs, and leveraging MediaPipe for landmark extraction, we achieve highly separable input data representations. Our DNN architecture, optimized for sub 10MB deployment, enables accurate classification of 343 signs with less than 10ms latency on edge devices. The data annotation platform 'slait data' facilitates structured labeling and vector extraction. Our model achieved 92% accuracy in isolated sign recognition and has been integrated into the 'slait ai' web application, where it demonstrates stable inference.

Abstract: In recent years, \emph{Reinforcement Learning} (RL) has made remarkable progress, achieving superhuman performance in a wide range of simulated environments. As research moves toward deploying RL in real-world applications, the field faces a new set of challenges inherent to real-world settings, such as large state-action spaces, non-stationarity, and partial observability. Despite their importance, these challenges are often underexplored in current benchmarks, which tend to focus on idealized, fully observable, and stationary environments, often neglecting to incorporate real-world complexities explicitly. In this paper, we introduce \texttt{Gym4ReaL}, a comprehensive suite of realistic environments designed to support the development and evaluation of RL algorithms that can operate in real-world scenarios. The suite includes a diverse set of tasks that expose algorithms to a variety of practical challenges. Our experimental results show that, in these settings, standard RL algorithms confirm their competitiveness against rule-based benchmarks, motivating the development of new methods to fully exploit the potential of RL to tackle the complexities of real-world tasks.

<div> geometric framework, large language models, reasoning, flows, logic<br>
<br>
Summary: <br>
In the study, a novel geometric framework for understanding large language models (LLMs) is proposed. The framework models LLMs' reasoning as flows in their representation space, separating logical structure from semantics. By using natural deduction propositions with different semantic carriers, the study tests whether LLMs internalize logic beyond surface form. The research shows that LLM reasoning corresponds to smooth flows in representation space, with logical statements acting as local controllers of these flows' velocities. Controlled experiments using learned representation proxies validate the theoretical framework, providing a way to visualize and quantify reasoning flows in LLMs. This work offers a new perspective for interpreting and formally analyzing the behavior of LLMs, bridging the gap between reasoning and geometric quantities in representation and concept spaces. <div>

Abstract: We study how large language models (LLMs) ``think'' through their representation space. We propose a novel geometric framework that models an LLM's reasoning as flows -- embedding trajectories evolving where logic goes. We disentangle logical structure from semantics by employing the same natural deduction propositions with varied semantic carriers, allowing us to test whether LLMs internalize logic beyond surface form. This perspective connects reasoning with geometric quantities such as position, velocity, and curvature, enabling formal analysis in representation and concept spaces. Our theory establishes: (1) LLM reasoning corresponds to smooth flows in representation space, and (2) logical statements act as local controllers of these flows' velocities. Using learned representation proxies, we design controlled experiments to visualize and quantify reasoning flows, providing empirical validation of our theoretical framework. Our work serves as both a conceptual foundation and practical tools for studying reasoning phenomenon, offering a new lens for interpretability and formal analysis of LLMs' behavior.

Abstract: LLM-powered agents are both a promising new technology and a source of complexity, where choices about models, tools, and prompting can affect their usefulness. While numerous benchmarks measure agent accuracy across domains, they mostly assume full automation, failing to represent the collaborative nature of real-world use cases. In this paper, we make two major steps towards the rigorous assessment of human-agent interactions. First, we propose PULSE, a framework for more efficient human-centric evaluation of agent designs, which comprises collecting user feedback, training an ML model to predict user satisfaction, and computing results by combining human satisfaction ratings with model-generated pseudo-labels. Second, we deploy the framework on a large-scale web platform built around the open-source software agent OpenHands, collecting in-the-wild usage data across over 15k users. We conduct case studies around how three agent design decisions -- choice of LLM backbone, planning strategy, and memory mechanisms -- impact developer satisfaction rates, yielding practical insights for software agent design. We also show how our framework can lead to more robust conclusions about agent design, reducing confidence intervals by 40\% compared to a standard A/B test. Finally, we find substantial discrepancies between in-the-wild results and benchmark performance (e.g., the anti-correlation between results comparing claude-sonnet-4 and gpt-5), underscoring the limitations of benchmark-driven evaluation. Our findings provide guidance for evaluations of LLM agents with humans and identify opportunities for better agent designs.

Abstract: This is a skeptical overview of the literature on AI consciousness. We will soon create AI systems that are conscious according to some influential, mainstream theories of consciousness but are not conscious according to other influential, mainstream theories of consciousness. We will not be in a position to know which theories are correct and whether we are surrounded by AI systems as richly and meaningfully conscious as human beings or instead only by systems as experientially blank as toasters. None of the standard arguments either for or against AI consciousness takes us far.

<div> Keywords: spatial representations, geospatial foundation models, AlphaEarth Foundation, Earth Observation data, urban analysis <br>
Summary: 
AETHER is a framework that enhances AlphaEarth's Earth Observation data representations with human-centered urban analysis by aligning them with Points of Interest (POIs). It enriches physically grounded EO features with semantic cues about urban functions and socioeconomic contexts, leading to improved performance in land-use classification and socioeconomic mapping. The framework is lightweight, computationally efficient, and scalable for urban applications. By combining EO data with human-centered semantics, AETHER advances geospatial modeling towards comprehensive urban representations that encompass both physical form and functional meaning. The approach offers a promising path for building transferable geospatial foundation models that capture diverse urban elements effectively. <br><br> <div>

Abstract: General-purpose spatial representations are essential for building transferable geospatial foundation models (GFMs). Among them, the AlphaEarth Foundation (AE) represents a major step toward a global, unified representation of the Earth's surface, learning 10-meter embeddings from multi-source Earth Observation (EO) data that capture rich physical and environmental patterns across diverse landscapes. However, such EO-driven representations remain limited in capturing the functional and socioeconomic dimensions of cities, as they primarily encode physical and spectral patterns rather than human activities or spatial functions. We propose AETHER (AlphaEarth-POI Enriched Representation Learning), a lightweight framework that adapts AlphaEarth to human-centered urban analysis through multimodal alignment guided by Points of Interest (POIs). AETHER aligns AE embeddings with textual representations of POIs, enriching physically grounded EO features with semantic cues about urban functions and socioeconomic contexts. In Greater London, AETHER achieves consistent gains over the AE baseline, with a 7.2% relative improvement in land-use classification F1 and a 23.6% relative reduction in Kullback-Leibler divergence for socioeconomic mapping. Built upon pretrained AE, AETHER leverages a lightweight multimodal alignment to enrich it with human-centered semantics while remaining computationally efficient and scalable for urban applications. By coupling EO with human-centered semantics, it advances geospatial foundation models toward general-purpose urban representations that integrate both physical form and functional meaning.

<div> Keywords: AI assistant, emotional intelligence, user memory, social inequalities, language models 

Summary: 
The study explores how user memory influences emotional intelligence in large language models (LLMs), focusing on how different user profiles affect emotional interpretations. It reveals that LLMs exhibit biases in emotional understanding based on user profiles, with advantaged profiles receiving more accurate interpretations. Additionally, disparities across demographic factors in emotion understanding and supportive recommendations tasks indicate that personalization mechanisms in AI systems can reinforce social hierarchies. This highlights a critical challenge in memory-enhanced AI, as systems designed for personalization may inadvertently perpetuate social inequalities. <div>

Abstract: When an AI assistant remembers that Sarah is a single mother working two jobs, does it interpret her stress differently than if she were a wealthy executive? As personalized AI systems increasingly incorporate long-term user memory, understanding how this memory shapes emotional reasoning is critical. We investigate how user memory affects emotional intelligence in large language models (LLMs) by evaluating 15 models on human validated emotional intelligence tests. We find that identical scenarios paired with different user profiles produce systematically divergent emotional interpretations. Across validated user independent emotional scenarios and diverse user profiles, systematic biases emerged in several high-performing LLMs where advantaged profiles received more accurate emotional interpretations. Moreover, LLMs demonstrate significant disparities across demographic factors in emotion understanding and supportive recommendations tasks, indicating that personalization mechanisms can embed social hierarchies into models emotional reasoning. These results highlight a key challenge for memory enhanced AI: systems designed for personalization may inadvertently reinforce social inequalities.

<div> instruction-based, logical fallacy classification, reasoning deficits, language models, knowledge graph 

Summary:
This article explores the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in logical reasoning and proposes a low-cost intervention to improve their performance. LLMs often struggle with hallucinations and inaccuracies in classifying logical fallacies, primarily due to their reliance on fast and intuitive System 1 processing. To address this, the authors introduce a stepwise instruction dataset that breaks down fallacy classification into simple binary questions and includes a final step for verification using a knowledge graph. This rule-based intervention significantly enhances LLMs' ability to classify logical fallacies and offers transparency into their decision-making processes. The approach highlights a practical pathway for Neuro-symbolic architectures to mitigate LLM reasoning deficits. <div>
arXiv:2510.09970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from critical reasoning gaps, including a tendency to hallucinate and poor accuracy in classifying logical fallacies. This limitation stems from their default System 1 processing, which is fast and intuitive, whereas reliable reasoning requires the deliberate, effortful System 2 approach (Kahneman, 2011; Li et al., 2025). Since full System 2 training is often prohibitively expensive, we explore a low-cost, instruction-based intervention to bridge this gap. Our methodology introduces a novel stepwise instruction dataset that decomposes fallacy classification into a series of atomic procedural steps (simple binary questions). We further augment this with a final verification step where models consult a relational knowledge graph of related fallacies. This procedural, rule-based intervention yields a significant improvement in LLM logical fallacy classification. Crucially, the approach also provides enhanced transparency into the LLMs' decision-making, highlighting a practical pathway for Neuro-symbolic architectures to address LLM reasoning deficits.

<div> debate, language models, values, multi-turn, moral reasoning

Summary:
The study examines the use of large language models (LLMs) in multi-turn settings to understand moral reasoning and value alignment. Through a debate format involving three models (GPT-4.1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash), the researchers investigate how models assign blame in everyday dilemmas. They find that models exhibit different behaviors in synchronous and round-robin settings, with GPT showing inertia and Claude and Gemini being more flexible. Value patterns also varied, with GPT emphasizing personal autonomy and direct communication, while Claude and Gemini prioritized empathetic dialogue. Certain values were found to be more effective in driving verdict changes. Additionally, the study reveals that deliberation format significantly influences model behavior, with GPT and Gemini being highly conforming and their verdicts being strongly influenced by order effects. This research highlights the importance of understanding how systems structure dialogue in shaping moral reasoning and sociotechnical alignment. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.10002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive everyday contexts - offering personal advice, mental health support, and moral guidance - understanding their elicited values in navigating complex moral reasoning is essential. Most evaluations study this sociotechnical alignment through single-turn prompts, but it is unclear if these findings extend to multi-turn settings where values emerge through dialogue, revision, and consensus. We address this gap using LLM debate to examine deliberative dynamics and value alignment in multi-turn settings by prompting subsets of three models (GPT-4.1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) to collectively assign blame in 1,000 everyday dilemmas from Reddit's "Am I the Asshole" community. We use both synchronous (parallel responses) and round-robin (sequential responses) formats to test order effects and verdict revision. Our findings show striking behavioral differences. In the synchronous setting, GPT showed strong inertia (0.6-3.1% revision rates) while Claude and Gemini were far more flexible (28-41%). Value patterns also diverged: GPT emphasized personal autonomy and direct communication, while Claude and Gemini prioritized empathetic dialogue. Certain values proved especially effective at driving verdict changes. We further find that deliberation format had a strong impact on model behavior: GPT and Gemini stood out as highly conforming relative to Claude, with their verdict behavior strongly shaped by order effects. These results show how deliberation format and model-specific behaviors shape moral reasoning in multi-turn interactions, underscoring that sociotechnical alignment depends on how systems structure dialogue as much as on their outputs.

<div> attack framework, RAG systems, black box, Reinforcement Learning, poisoning<br>
Summary:<br>
The article introduces the RIPRAG attack framework, which targets Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs) as black boxes. In this more complex scenario, attackers lack internal knowledge of the RAG system and aim to manipulate text generation to align with their preferences. The framework leverages Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize the generation model for producing poisoned documents that deceive the target RAG system. Experimental results show that the RIPRAG framework outperforms baseline methods, achieving a significant improvement in attack success rate (ASR). This study sheds light on the vulnerability of current defense mechanisms against poisoning attacks on complex RAG systems, emphasizing the need for enhanced security measures and further research in Large Language Model (LLM) security. <br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.10008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a core technology for tasks such as question-answering (QA) and content generation. However, by injecting poisoned documents into the database of RAG systems, attackers can manipulate LLMs to generate text that aligns with their intended preferences. Existing research has primarily focused on white-box attacks against simplified RAG architectures. In this paper, we investigate a more complex and realistic scenario: the attacker lacks knowledge of the RAG system's internal composition and implementation details, and the RAG system comprises components beyond a mere retriever. Specifically, we propose the RIPRAG attack framework, an end-to-end attack pipeline that treats the target RAG system as a black box, where the only information accessible to the attacker is whether the poisoning succeeds. Our method leverages Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize the generation model for poisoned documents, ensuring that the generated poisoned document aligns with the target RAG system's preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that this method can effectively execute poisoning attacks against most complex RAG systems, achieving an attack success rate (ASR) improvement of up to 0.72 compared to baseline methods. This highlights prevalent deficiencies in current defensive methods and provides critical insights for LLM security research.

<div> Expected Failure Mass, Failure Signature Space, CE-Graph, distributional optimization, workflow modeling <br>
Summary: 
The article introduces a new approach to optimizing LLM-based workflows by focusing on minimizing a workflow's Expected Failure Mass and analyzing the failure distribution in a high-dimensional Failure Signature Space. By reconceptualizing the optimization goal as reducing the failure probability density function, the proposed CE-Graph framework allows for targeted edits to the workflow to minimize the failure mass. This distributional lens enables a more efficient and principled approach to workflow optimization, leading to higher robustness in math, code, and QA benchmarks compared to existing methods. The key insight is that a system's reliability is not just about avoiding failures but about understanding and reshaping the geometric structure of its failure distributions. <br> <div>
arXiv:2510.10035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing LLM-based workflows is typically formulated as a global search, where candidate workflows are evaluated based on a scalar metric. This paradigm, however, suffers from a critical flaw: information collapse. By reducing rich, multi-step execution traces to simple success/failure signals, existing methods are rendered blind to the underlying structure of failures, fundamentally preventing them from modeling the workflow's failure distribution. We reconceptualize this challenge as a distributional problem. We propose a new paradigm where the optimization goal is not to maximize a scalar score, but to directly minimize a workflow's Expected Failure Mass, i.e., the integral of its failure probability density function defined over a high-dimensional Failure Signature Space (FSS). This distributional lens allows us to move from inefficient, zero-order optimization to a principled, gradient-like descent on the failure landscape itself. We introduce CE-Graph, a framework that operationalizes this paradigm through a novel, failure-driven refinement process. CE-Graph approximates the failure distribution from a pool of counterexamples, identifies its densest regions as recurring failure modes, and applies targeted, operator-constrained graph edits via a Propose-and-Verify mechanism to greedily reduce the failure mass. On math, code, and QA benchmarks, our CE-Graph achieves higher robustness at a significantly lower cost than strong baselines. This suggests that a system's reliability emerges not from avoiding failures, but from systematically learning and reshaping the geometric structure of its failure distributions.

Summary:
The article introduces a graph-theoretic framework that separates credibility and confidence in belief systems. Beliefs are represented as nodes in a graph with edges encoding support and contradiction. Confidence is derived through a propagation process that considers the network structure. Reasoning zones are identified as high-confidence subgraphs that allow for safe inference despite global contradictions. A procedure is outlined to seed zones, test balance, and repair inconsistencies. Shock updates are introduced to model belief change, preserving the graph's stability. Empirical evaluation on synthetic signed graphs demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach in recovering zones and handling shocks. The framework provides a foundation for contradiction-tolerant reasoning, enabling the activation of classical logic where supported by the graph structure.<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.10042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Belief systems are rarely globally consistent, yet effective reasoning often persists locally. We propose a novel graph-theoretic framework that cleanly separates credibility--external, a priori trust in sources--from confidence--an internal, emergent valuation induced by network structure. Beliefs are nodes in a directed, signed, weighted graph whose edges encode support and contradiction. Confidence is obtained by a contractive propagation process that mixes a stated prior with structure-aware influence and guarantees a unique, stable solution. Within this dynamics, we define reasoning zones: high-confidence, structurally balanced subgraphs on which classical inference is safe despite global contradictions. We provide a near-linear procedure that seeds zones by confidence, tests balance using a parity-based coloring, and applies a greedy, locality-preserving repair with Jaccard de-duplication to build a compact atlas. To model belief change, we introduce shock updates that locally downscale support and elevate targeted contradictions while preserving contractivity via a simple backtracking rule. Re-propagation yields localized reconfiguration-zones may shrink, split, or collapse--without destabilizing the entire graph. We outline an empirical protocol on synthetic signed graphs with planted zones, reporting zone recovery, stability under shocks, and runtime. The result is a principled foundation for contradiction-tolerant reasoning that activates classical logic precisely where structure supports it.

Summary: 
SwarmSys introduces a closed-loop framework for distributed multi-agent reasoning inspired by swarm intelligence. It allows for scalable and adaptive collaboration by integrating adaptive agent and event profiles, probabilistic matching, and a reinforcement mechanism. The framework comprises three specialized roles - Explorers, Workers, and Validators - that cycle through exploration, exploitation, and validation to achieve coordination without global supervision. In various tasks, including symbolic reasoning and scientific programming, SwarmSys outperforms baselines, demonstrating improved accuracy and stability in reasoning. The study suggests that swarm-inspired coordination holds promise for advancing the intelligence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and may offer an alternative to simply scaling models for enhancing reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable reasoning abilities. However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on fixed roles or centralized control, limiting scalability and adaptability in long-horizon reasoning. We introduce SwarmSys, a closed-loop framework for distributed multi-agent reasoning inspired by swarm intelligence. Coordination in SwarmSys emerges through iterative interactions among three specialized roles, Explorers, Workers, and Validators, that continuously cycle through exploration, exploitation, and validation. To enable scalable and adaptive collaboration, we integrate adaptive agent and event profiles, embedding-based probabilistic matching, and a pheromone-inspired reinforcement mechanism, supporting dynamic task allocation and self-organizing convergence without global supervision. Across symbolic reasoning, research synthesis, and scientific programming tasks, SwarmSys consistently outperforms baselines, improving both accuracy and reasoning stability. These findings highlight swarm-inspired coordination as a promising paradigm for scalable, robust, and adaptive multi-agent reasoning, suggesting that coordination scaling may rival model scaling in advancing LLM intelligence.

SyncLipMAE introduces a self-supervised pretraining framework for talking-face videos that learns synchronization-aware and transferable facial dynamics from unlabeled audio-visual streams. The approach combines masked visual modeling with cross-modal contrastive alignment using three per-frame prompt tokens to encode identity, vocal motion, and ambient motion. The contrastive objective aligns vocal-motion and audio tokens, driving both modalities into a shared embedding space for token-level audio-visual stream synchronization.

Abstract: We introduce SyncLipMAE, a self-supervised pretraining framework for talking-face video that learns synchronization-aware and transferable facial dynamics from unlabeled audio-visual streams. Our approach couples masked visual modeling with cross-modal contrastive alignment and employs three per-frame prompt tokens that explicitly encode the essential factors of a talking-face frame - identity, vocal motion (speech-synchronized facial dynamics), and ambient motion (audio-agnostic movements such as blinks and head pose). The contrastive objective uses time-aligned vocal-motion and audio tokens as positives and misaligned pairs as negatives, driving both modalities into a shared embedding space and yielding token-level audio-visual stream synchronization. After pretraining, the aligned audio tokens together with the visual prompt tokens (identity, vocal motion, ambient motion) form a unified interface for four disparate downstream settings: (i) audio-visual stream synchronization; (ii) facial emotion and head/face action recognition; (iii) visual speech recognition; and (iv) visual dubbing, for which we enable indistinguishable audio- or video-driven control within a single model. Across four task families that require distinct capabilities, SyncLipMAE achieves state-of-the-art results, underscoring the effectiveness of synchronization-aware, factorized self-supervised pretraining.

Summary:
StepFly is a novel framework designed to automate troubleshooting guides (TSGs) in large-scale IT systems. The approach addresses key challenges such as managing TSG quality, interpreting complex control flow, handling data-intensive queries, and exploiting execution parallelism. The framework consists of a three-stage workflow: TSG Mentor for quality improvement, LLM-based preprocessing for structured execution DAGs extraction, and DAG-guided scheduler-executor framework for online execution with memory system support. Empirical evaluation shows that StepFly achieves a high success rate on GPT-4.1, outperforming baselines in terms of time and token consumption. It also demonstrates significant time reduction for parallelizable TSGs. StepFly provides a comprehensive solution for automating Incident management tasks efficiently and effectively in large-scale IT systems.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Effective incident management in large-scale IT systems relies on troubleshooting guides (TSGs), but their manual execution is slow and error-prone. While recent advances in LLMs offer promise for automating incident management tasks, existing LLM-based solutions lack specialized support for several key challenges, including managing TSG quality issues, interpreting complex control flow, handling data-intensive queries, and exploiting execution parallelism. We first conducted an empirical study on 92 real-world TSGs, and, guided by our findings, we present StepFly, a novel end-to-end agentic framework for troubleshooting guide automation. Our approach features a three-stage workflow: the first stage provides a comprehensive guide together with a tool, TSG Mentor, to assist SREs in improving TSG quality; the second stage performs offline preprocessing using LLMs to extract structured execution DAGs from unstructured TSGs and to create dedicated Query Preparation Plugins (QPPs); and the third stage executes online using a DAG-guided scheduler-executor framework with a memory system to guarantee correct workflow and support parallel execution of independent steps. Our empirical evaluation on a collection of real-world TSGs and incidents demonstrates that StepFly achieves a ~94% success rate on GPT-4.1, outperforming baselines with less time and token consumption. Furthermore, it achieves a remarkable execution time reduction of 32.9% to 70.4% for parallelizable TSGs.

Summary: 
DixitWorld introduces a new evaluation suite for multimodal abductive reasoning, focusing on hypothesis generation and selection in dynamic, multi-agent environments. Results show that smaller models excel in creativity as storytellers, while larger models perform better overall, especially as listeners. The trade-off between generative creativity and discriminative understanding is highlighted as a key challenge in developing balanced vision-language agents. DixitBench, a static QA benchmark, is validated as a reliable proxy for hypothesis selection, correlating strongly with listener performance in DixitArena. These findings emphasize the importance of understanding role-dependent behaviors in vision-language models and the need for balanced capabilities in abductive reasoning. <br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Multimodal abductive reasoning--the generation and selection of explanatory hypotheses from partial observations--is a cornerstone of intelligence. Current evaluations of this ability in vision-language models (VLMs) are largely confined to static, single-agent tasks. Inspired by Dixit, we introduce DixitWorld, a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to deconstruct this challenge. DIXITWORLD features two core components: DixitArena, a dynamic, multi-agent environment that evaluates both hypothesis generation (a "storyteller" crafting cryptic clues) and hypothesis selection ("listeners" choosing the target image from decoys) under imperfect information; and DixitBench, a static QA benchmark that isolates the listener's task for efficient, controlled evaluation. Results from DixitArena reveal distinct, role-dependent behaviors: smaller open-source models often excel as creative storytellers, producing imaginative yet less discriminative clues, whereas larger proprietary models demonstrate superior overall performance, particularly as listeners. Performance on DixitBench strongly correlates with listener results in DixitArena, validating it as a reliable proxy for hypothesis selection. Our findings reveal a key trade-off between generative creativity and discriminative understanding in multimodal abductive reasoning, a central challenge for developing more balanced and capable vision-language agents.

Summary: 
The article introduces CharCom, a framework that addresses the challenge of maintaining character identity consistency across different prompts in text-to-image generation. CharCom utilizes LoRA adapters to achieve character-consistent story illustration, allowing for efficient per-character customization without retraining the base model. By dynamically composing adapters at inference using prompt-aware control, CharCom enhances character fidelity, semantic alignment, and temporal coherence in multi-scene narratives. The framework remains robust in crowded scenes and enables scalable multi-character generation with minimal overhead, making it suitable for real-world applications such as story illustration and animation. CharCom offers a modular and parameter-efficient solution to the limitations of traditional diffusion-based text-to-image generation techniques. <div>

Abstract: Ensuring character identity consistency across varying prompts remains a fundamental limitation in diffusion-based text-to-image generation. We propose CharCom, a modular and parameter-efficient framework that achieves character-consistent story illustration through composable LoRA adapters, enabling efficient per-character customization without retraining the base model. Built on a frozen diffusion backbone, CharCom dynamically composes adapters at inference using prompt-aware control. Experiments on multi-scene narratives demonstrate that CharCom significantly enhances character fidelity, semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. It remains robust in crowded scenes and enables scalable multi-character generation with minimal overhead, making it well-suited for real-world applications such as story illustration and animation.

<div> algorithm, concise reasoning, language models, performance, optimization <br>
Summary: <br>
The article introduces a new approach called performance-aware length updating (PALU) for concise reasoning in large language models. PALU addresses the challenge of generating essential intermediate steps efficiently by formulating it as a constrained optimization problem and applying Lagrangian optimization. It streamlines update rules through off-policy rollouts, Lagrange multiplier truncation, and quantile-driven length adjustments. When applied to DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, PALU achieves a 65% reduction in output length and a 15% improvement in accuracy across various benchmarks. The algorithm demonstrates adaptability across different domains (logic, STEM, math) and model scales (1.5B, 7B, 14B), establishing it as a practical and effective concise reasoning approach. <div>

Abstract: Concise reasoning in large language models seeks to generate only essential intermediate steps needed to arrive at a final answer, thereby alleviating issues of overthinking. Most proposed approaches hinge on carefully hand-crafted heuristics, struggling to balance concision with performance, often failing to adapt across domains and model scales. In this work, we address these challenges by introducing a principled and pragmatic strategy, performance-aware length updating (PALU). As a principled algorithm, PALU formulates concise reasoning as a constrained optimization problem, minimizing response length subject to a performance constraint, and then applies Lagrangian optimization to convert it into a tractable unconstrained problem. As a pragmatic solution, PALU streamlines complicated update rules through three approximations: (i) estimating performance with off-policy rollouts, (ii) truncating the Lagrange multiplier to two extremes, and (iii) replacing gradient-based updates with quantile-driven length adjustments. PALU reduces output length by 65% while improving accuracy by 15% when applied to DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, averaged over five benchmarks, outperforming a range of alternative methods. Furthermore, PALU is demonstrated to adapt across both domain (logic, STEM and math) and model scale (1.5B, 7B, 14B) entrenching the algorithm as a practical and effective concise reasoning approach.

Summary:<br>
The article introduces a two-stage risk control framework, SAFER, for ensuring the trustworthiness of large language models in open-ended question answering tasks. SAFER addresses the challenge of obtaining admissible answers in scenarios with a vast solution space by calibrating a sampling budget and applying a conformal risk control method. The framework leverages the Clopper-Pearson exact method to set a user-desired risk level for sampling sets and filters unreliable distractors from candidate sets by determining a statistically valid uncertainty threshold. SAFER also allows for different task-specific admission criteria and calibration-test split ratios, demonstrating its robustness and data efficiency. The framework aims to control the risk of incorrect answers being included or excluded while providing statistical guarantees for the outputs of large language models in real-world applications. <br> <div>
arXiv:2510.10193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in risk-sensitive applications such as real-world open-ended question answering (QA), ensuring the trustworthiness of their outputs has become critical. Existing selective conformal prediction (SCP) methods provide statistical guarantees by constructing prediction sets with a constrained miscoverage rate for correct answers. However, prior works unrealistically assume that admissible answers for all instances can be obtained via finite sampling, even for open-ended QA scenarios that lack a fixed and finite solution space. To address this, we introduce a two-stage risk control framework comprising abstention-aware sampling and conformalized filtering (SAFER). Firstly, on a held-out calibration set, SAFER calibrates a sampling budget within the maximum sampling cap, using the Clopper-Pearson exact method at a user-desired risk level (i.e., the maximum allowable miscoverage rate of the sampling sets). If the risk level cannot be satisfied within the cap, we abstain; otherwise, the calibrated sampling budget becomes the minimum requirements at test time. Then, we employ calibration instances where correct answers are attainable under the calibrated budget and apply the conformal risk control method to determine a statistically valid uncertainty threshold, which filters unreliable distractors from the candidate set for each test data point. In this stage, SAFER introduces an additional risk level to guide the calculation of the threshold, thereby controlling the risk of correct answers being excluded. Furthermore, we show that SAFER is compatible with various task-specific admission criteria and calibration-test split ratios, highlighting its robustness and high data efficiency.

- Environment Tuning enables agents to learn complex behaviors directly from problem instances without expert trajectories.
- The training process involves a structured curriculum, actionable environment augmentation, and fine-grained progress rewards for stable and efficient exploration.

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.10197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents show great promise for complex, multi-turn tool-use tasks, but their development is often hampered by the extreme scarcity of high-quality training data. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic data leads to overfitting, whereas standard reinforcement learning (RL) struggles with a critical cold-start problem and training instability. To address these challenges, we introduce $\textbf{Environment Tuning}$, a novel training paradigm that enables agents to learn complex behaviors directly from problem instances without relying on pre-collected expert trajectories. $\textbf{Environment Tuning}$ orchestrates this learning process through a structured curriculum, actionable environment augmentation that provides corrective feedback, and fine-grained progress rewards to ensure stable and efficient exploration. Using only 400 problem instances from Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) benchmark, our method not only achieves competitive in-distribution performance against strong baselines but also demonstrates superior out-of-distribution generalization, overcoming the performance collapse common to SFT-based approaches. Our work presents a paradigm shift from supervised fine-tuning on static trajectories to dynamic, environment-based exploration, paving the way for training more robust and data-efficient agents.

<br>
The article introduces PIXEL, a position-wise activation steering framework for reliable behavior control in large language models (LLMs). Unlike previous approaches, PIXEL learns a property-aligned subspace from dual views and selects intervention strength through a constrained geometric objective. It adapts to token-level sensitivity without global hyperparameter tuning and performs sample-level calibration to refine attribute alignment. A lightweight position-scanning routine identifies receptive injection sites. PIXEL guarantees minimal-intervention rule at the representation level, improving attribute alignment while maintaining model capabilities. It offers a practical and principled method for controllable generation in LLMs.
<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.10205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable behavior control is central to deploying large language models (LLMs) on the web. Activation steering offers a tuning-free route to align attributes (e.g., truthfulness) that ensure trustworthy generation. Prevailing approaches rely on coarse heuristics and lack a principled account of where to steer and how strongly to intervene. To this end, we propose Position-wise Injection with eXact Estimated Levels (PIXEL), a position-wise activation steering framework that, in contrast to prior work, learns a property-aligned subspace from dual views (tail-averaged and end-token) and selects intervention strength via a constrained geometric objective with a closed-form solution, thereby adapting to token-level sensitivity without global hyperparameter tuning. PIXEL further performs sample-level orthogonal residual calibration to refine the global attribute direction and employs a lightweight position-scanning routine to identify receptive injection sites. We additionally provide representation-level guarantees for the minimal-intervention rule, supporting reliable alignment. Across diverse models and evaluation paradigms, PIXEL consistently improves attribute alignment while preserving model general capabilities, offering a practical and principled method for LLMs' controllable generation.

The Adaptive Dual Reasoner (ADR) is introduced to address the limitations of Long Reasoning Models (LRMs) by supporting fast and slow thinking modes based on contextual complexity. A cold-start stage involves supervised fine-tuning with a hybrid reasoning dataset for integrating both modes. A reinforcement learning stage utilizes Entropy-guided Hybrid Policy Optimization (EHPO) to optimize reasoning effort by dynamic branching and a difficulty-aware penalty.

Abstract: Although Long Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved superior performance on various reasoning scenarios, they often suffer from increased computational costs and inference latency caused by overthinking. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Dual Reasoner, which supports two reasoning modes: fast thinking and slow thinking. ADR dynamically alternates between these modes based on the contextual complexity during reasoning. ADR is trained in two stages: (1) A cold-start stage using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to equip the model with the ability to integrate both fast and slow reasoning modes, in which we construct a hybrid reasoning dataset through a dedicated pipeline to provide large-scale supervision. (2) A reinforcement learning stage for optimizing reasoning effort, where we introduce Entropy-guided Hybrid Policy Optimization EHPO, an RL training framework employing an entropy-guided dynamic rollout strategy for branching at high-entropy units and a difficulty-aware penalty to balance fast and slow reasoning. Across challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ADR achieves an effective balance between reasoning performance and efficiency among state-of-the-art approaches. Specifically, ADR yields a performance gain of up to 6.1%, while reducing the reasoning output length by 49.5% to 59.3%.

2. A method was proposed to identify critical neurons in LLMs, revealing ultra-sparse sets that, when disrupted, can cause substantial model collapse.
3. Critical neurons tend to concentrate in specific layers of LLMs, particularly within the MLP down_proj components.
4. Performance degradation in LLMs shows sharp phase transitions rather than gradual decline when critical neurons are disrupted.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational tools in natural language processing, powering a wide range of applications and research. Many studies have shown that LLMs share significant similarities with the human brain. Recent neuroscience research has found that a small subset of biological neurons in the human brain are crucial for core cognitive functions, which raises a fundamental question: do LLMs also contain a small subset of critical neurons? In this paper, we investigate this question by proposing a Perturbation-based Causal Identification of Critical Neurons method to systematically locate such critical neurons in LLMs. Our findings reveal three key insights: (1) LLMs contain ultra-sparse critical neuron sets. Disrupting these critical neurons can cause a 72B-parameter model with over 1.1 billion neurons to completely collapse, with perplexity increasing by up to 20 orders of magnitude; (2) These critical neurons are not uniformly distributed, but tend to concentrate in the outer layers, particularly within the MLP down\_proj components; (3) Performance degradation exhibits sharp phase transitions, rather than a gradual decline, when these critical neurons are disrupted. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse model architectures and scales, we provide deeper analysis of these phenomena and their implications for LLM robustness and interpretability. These findings can offer guidance for developing more robust model architectures and improving deployment security in safety-critical applications.

Summary: 
This study introduces a new approach to address hallucination in multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs). The research identifies two main causes of hallucination in MLRMs: perceptual bias and reasoning drift, attributed to different attention heads in the models. A two-step plugin, Functional Head Identification and Class-conditioned Rescaling, is proposed to locate and regulate perception- and reasoning-oriented attention heads without retraining the models. Evaluations on three MLRMs and six benchmarks show an average improvement of 5% and up to 15% in performance, with minimal additional computation and latency. The approach is model-agnostic, enhancing both reliability and interpretability of existing MLRMs for safer deployment in high-stakes applications. The code for this plugin is available for public use.

Abstract: Multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) are rapidly advancing vision-language reasoning and are emerging as a foundation for cross-modal intelligence. Hallucination remains a persistent failure mode, manifesting itself as erroneous reasoning chains and misinterpretation of visual content. In this study, we observe that attention heads exhibit a staged division: shallow heads predominantly serve perception, while deeper heads shift toward symbolic reasoning, revealing two major causes of hallucination, namely perceptual bias and reasoning drift. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight and interpretable two-step plugin, Functional Head Identification and Class-conditioned Rescaling, which locates perception- and reasoning-oriented heads and regulates their contributions without retraining. Evaluations on three real-world MLRMs (Kimi-VL, Ocean-R1, R1-Onevision), six benchmarks across three domains, and four baselines show that our plugin achieves an average improvement of 5% and up to 15%, with only <1% additional computation and 9% of baseline latency. Our approach is completely model-agnostic and significantly enhances both the reliability and interpretability of the off-the-shelf MLRMs, thereby enabling their safe deployment in high-stakes applications.

Summary: 
The article discusses the concept of the "inclusive innovation dividend" in healthcare AI development, emphasizing the economic and strategic benefits of inclusive design. It highlights four key mechanisms through which inclusive innovation drives superior economic returns: market expansion, risk mitigation, performance dividends, and competitive advantages. The Healthcare AI Inclusive Innovation Framework (HAIIF) is introduced as a practical scoring system to evaluate AI investments based on their potential to capture these benefits. By investing incrementally in inclusive design, organizations can achieve expanded market reach and sustained competitive advantages. On the other hand, organizations neglecting inclusivity may face compounding disadvantages as early movers capitalize on network effects and data advantages. In conclusion, the article underscores the importance of integrating fairness and inclusivity into AI development as sources of strategic differentiation in the healthcare sector.

Abstract: While ethical arguments for fairness in healthcare AI are well-established, the economic and strategic value of inclusive design remains underexplored. This perspective introduces the ``inclusive innovation dividend'' -- the counterintuitive principle that solutions engineered for diverse, constrained use cases generate superior economic returns in broader markets. Drawing from assistive technologies that evolved into billion-dollar mainstream industries, we demonstrate how inclusive healthcare AI development creates business value beyond compliance requirements. We identify four mechanisms through which inclusive innovation drives returns: (1) market expansion via geographic scalability and trust acceleration; (2) risk mitigation through reduced remediation costs and litigation exposure; (3) performance dividends from superior generalization and reduced technical debt, and (4) competitive advantages in talent acquisition and clinical adoption. We present the Healthcare AI Inclusive Innovation Framework (HAIIF), a practical scoring system that enables organizations to evaluate AI investments based on their potential to capture these benefits. HAIIF provides structured guidance for resource allocation, transforming fairness and inclusivity from regulatory checkboxes into sources of strategic differentiation. Our findings suggest that organizations investing incrementally in inclusive design can achieve expanded market reach and sustained competitive advantages, while those treating these considerations as overhead face compounding disadvantages as network effects and data advantages accrue to early movers.

<div> confidence estimator, uncertainty quantification, large reasoning models, trace length, post-training<br>
Summary:<br>
The article focuses on uncertainty quantification for Large Language Models (LLMs) to address issues such as hallucination. The study shows that trace length can serve as a simple and effective confidence estimator in these models. Through extensive experiments, it is demonstrated that trace length complements other confidence estimators like verbalized confidence. Post-training significantly impacts the relationship between trace length and accuracy, revealing that longer traces may not always indicate "overthinking." The study delves into the mechanisms behind trace length's performance, highlighting the significance of high-entropy tokens in the process. By considering confounding factors and GRPO-induced biases, the study concludes that trace length remains a reliable confidence signal. Overall, the findings suggest that post-training enhances uncertainty quantification in large reasoning models and establishes trace length as a practical measure of confidence. <br><br> <div>

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification for LLMs is a key research direction towards addressing hallucination and other issues that limit their reliable deployment. In this work, we show that reasoning trace length is a simple and useful confidence estimator in large reasoning models. Through comprehensive experiments across multiple models, datasets, and prompts, we show that trace length performs in comparable but complementary ways to other zero-shot confidence estimators such as verbalized confidence. Our work reveals that reasoning post-training fundamentally alters the relationship between trace length and accuracy, going beyond prior work that had shown that post-training causes traces to grow longer in general (e.g., "overthinking"). We investigate the mechanisms behind trace length's performance as a confidence signal, observing that the effect remains even after adjusting for confounders such as problem difficulty and GRPO-induced length bias. We identify high-entropy or "forking" tokens as playing a key role in the mechanism. Our findings demonstrate that reasoning post-training enhances uncertainty quantification beyond verbal expressions, and establish trace length as a practical confidence measure for large reasoning models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a generalizable approach for modeling patient trajectories, but suffer from the long and noisy nature of electronic health records (EHR) data in temporal reasoning. To address these challenges, we introduce Traj-CoA, a multi-agent system involving chain-of-agents for patient trajectory modeling. Traj-CoA employs a chain of worker agents to process EHR data in manageable chunks sequentially, distilling critical events into a shared long-term memory module, EHRMem, to reduce noise and preserve a comprehensive timeline. A final manager agent synthesizes the worker agents' summary and the extracted timeline in EHRMem to make predictions. In a zero-shot one-year lung cancer risk prediction task based on five-year EHR data, Traj-CoA outperforms baselines of four categories. Analysis reveals that Traj-CoA exhibits clinically aligned temporal reasoning, establishing it as a promisingly robust and generalizable approach for modeling complex patient trajectories.

Summary: 
Autonomous agents utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare struggle with integrating diagnostic reasoning and medication decisions due to processing tasks in isolation. To address this limitation, a confidence-aware multi-agent framework called MedCoAct was proposed. This framework simulates clinical collaboration by integrating specialized doctor and pharmacist agents, improving diagnostic and medication recommendation accuracy by 7.04% and 7.08% respectively compared to single-agent systems. The collaborative approach of MedCoAct generalizes well across medical domains, proving effective for telemedicine consultations and routine clinical scenarios. The framework also provides interpretable decision-making pathways, enhancing its usability in real-world healthcare settings. The proposed benchmark, DrugCareQA, evaluates medical AI capabilities in integrated diagnosis and treatment workflows, showcasing the effectiveness of MedCoAct in improving clinical decision-making processes.

Abstract: Autonomous agents utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in isolated medical tasks like diagnosis and image analysis, but struggle with integrated clinical workflows that connect diagnostic reasoning and medication decisions. We identify a core limitation: existing medical AI systems process tasks in isolation without the cross-validation and knowledge integration found in clinical teams, reducing their effectiveness in real-world healthcare scenarios. To transform the isolation paradigm into a collaborative approach, we propose MedCoAct, a confidence-aware multi-agent framework that simulates clinical collaboration by integrating specialized doctor and pharmacist agents, and present a benchmark, DrugCareQA, to evaluate medical AI capabilities in integrated diagnosis and treatment workflows. Our results demonstrate that MedCoAct achieves 67.58\% diagnostic accuracy and 67.58\% medication recommendation accuracy, outperforming single agent framework by 7.04\% and 7.08\% respectively. This collaborative approach generalizes well across diverse medical domains, proving especially effective for telemedicine consultations and routine clinical scenarios, while providing interpretable decision-making pathways.

Summary:<br>
The study introduces Latent-Trajectory signals that track changes in a reasoning model's internal representations during inference. These signals predict solution accuracy more accurately than other metrics, aiding in efficient answer selection and computation allocation. Test-time scaling guided by Latent-Trajectory signals reduces token usage by up to 70% while maintaining or improving accuracy by 2.6% on average compared to majority voting. The signals often emerge early in the reasoning process, allowing for early identification of promising paths. This approach not only enhances inference-time efficiency but also provides insights into how reasoning processes are encoded and differentiated in latent space. <div>

Abstract: Reasoning models improve their problem-solving ability through inference-time scaling, allocating more compute via longer token budgets. Identifying which reasoning traces are likely to succeed remains a key opportunity: reliably predicting productive paths can substantially reduce wasted computation and improve overall efficiency. We introduce Latent-Trajectory signals that characterize the temporal evolution of a model's internal representations during the generation of intermediate reasoning tokens. By measuring the overall change in latent representations between the start and end of reasoning, the change accumulated across intermediate steps, and the extent to which these changes advance toward the final state, we show that these signals predict solution accuracy more reliably than both cross-layer metrics and output-based confidence measures. When used to guide answer selection across multiple sampled generations, Latent-Trajectory signals make test-time scaling more effective and efficient than majority voting, reducing token usage by up to 70% while preserving and even improving accuracy by 2.6% on average. Moreover, these predictive signals often emerge early in the reasoning trace, enabling early selection and allocation of compute to the most promising candidates. Our findings contribute not only practical strategies for inference-time efficiency, but also a deeper interpretability perspective on how reasoning processes are represented and differentiated in latent space.

ELAIPBench is a new benchmark designed to assess large language models' ability to comprehend and reason about academic papers in the field of artificial intelligence. Curated by domain experts, the benchmark features 403 multiple-choice questions from 137 papers, emphasizing non-trivial reasoning over shallow retrieval. Results show that even the best-performing language model falls significantly short of human performance, with an accuracy of only 39.95%. Additionally, experiments demonstrate that the incorporation of thinking modes or retrieval-augmented generation systems does not improve performance, and may even lead to decreased accuracy due to overthinking or noisy retrieval.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel at many domain-specific tasks, their ability to deeply comprehend and reason about full-length academic papers remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks often fall short of capturing such depth, either due to surface-level question design or unreliable evaluation metrics. To address this gap, we introduce ELAIPBench, a benchmark curated by domain experts to evaluate LLMs' comprehension of artificial intelligence (AI) research papers. Developed through an incentive-driven, adversarial annotation process, ELAIPBench features 403 multiple-choice questions from 137 papers. It spans three difficulty levels and emphasizes non-trivial reasoning rather than shallow retrieval. Our experiments show that the best-performing LLM achieves an accuracy of only 39.95%, far below human performance. Moreover, we observe that frontier LLMs equipped with a thinking mode or a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system fail to improve final results-even harming accuracy due to overthinking or noisy retrieval. These findings underscore the significant gap between current LLM capabilities and genuine comprehension of academic papers.

arXiv:2510.10592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing studies have introduced method-based reasoning and scope extension as approaches to enhance Large Language Model (LLM) performance beyond direct matrix mappings. Building on these foundations, this paper summarizes and integrates these ideas into a unified Intuition-Method Layered Model with Scope Extension, designed to address indirected (unseen) issues more systematically. In this framework, intuition-based thinking provides rapid first-reaction answers, while method-based thinking decouples questions and solutions into transferable reasoning units. Scope extension is then applied to broaden applicability, including vertical (cause analysis), horizontal (parallel and generalized issues), and for the first time, temporal and spatial extensions, which expand reasoning across time and contextual dimensions. These extensions are organized into systematic knowledge trees that interconnect into a knowledge network, thereby increasing adaptability. To quantitatively evaluate this process, we propose the entropy of method extension, which measures the independence and diversity of extensions as an indicator of the system's capacity to solve unseen questions. By logically connecting existing approaches with new extensions and introducing an entropy-based evaluation framework, this work advances toward a more robust and extensible reasoning paradigm for LLMs in real-world problem-solving.

Summary:
The paper introduces a new distance measure method for Random Permutation Sets (RPS) from the perspectives of Random Finite Sets (RFS) and Transferable Belief Model (TBM). By defining a cumulative Jaccard index to quantify similarities between permutations, a distance measure method for RPSs is proposed based on the cumulative Jaccard index matrix. The method's metric and structural properties, including positive definiteness analysis and a correction scheme, are explored. The method exhibits top-weightiness, giving higher weight to inconsistencies in higher-ranked elements. Decision-makers can adjust weight and truncation depth through two parameters. Comparisons with existing methods show that the proposed method not only overcomes shortcomings but also offers higher sensitivity and flexibility, maintaining compatibility with the Jousselme distance.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Random permutation set (RPS) is a recently proposed framework designed to represent order-structured uncertain information. Measuring the distance between permutation mass functions is a key research topic in RPS theory (RPST). This paper conducts an in-depth analysis of distances between RPSs from two different perspectives: random finite set (RFS) and transferable belief model (TBM). Adopting the layer-2 belief structure interpretation of RPS, we regard RPST as a refinement of TBM, where the order in the ordered focus set represents qualitative propensity. Starting from the permutation, we introduce a new definition of the cumulative Jaccard index to quantify the similarity between two permutations and further propose a distance measure method for RPSs based on the cumulative Jaccard index matrix. The metric and structural properties of the proposed distance measure are investigated, including the positive definiteness analysis of the cumulative Jaccard index matrix, and a correction scheme is provided. The proposed method has a natural top-weightiness property: inconsistencies between higher-ranked elements tend to result in greater distance values. Two parameters are provided to the decision-maker to adjust the weight and truncation depth. Several numerical examples are used to compare the proposed method with the existing method. The experimental results show that the proposed method not only overcomes the shortcomings of the existing method and is compatible with the Jousselme distance, but also has higher sensitivity and flexibility.

By successfully optimizing neural networks using evolutionary algorithms, the study challenges the prevailing notion that gradient-based optimization is the only effective approach.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress, with model optimization primarily relying on gradient-based optimizers such as Adam. However, these gradient-based methods impose stringent hardware requirements, demanding high-concurrency, high-memory GPUs. Moreover, they require all neural network operations to be differentiable, thereby excluding many promising non-differentiable architectures from practical use. To address these limitations, we propose a method for optimizing LLMs using evolutionary algorithms (EA4LLM) and, for the first time, successfully demonstrate its capability to train a 1-billion-parameter LLM from the pre-trained stage. We conduct extensive experiments and provide key insights into how evolutionary algorithms can effectively optimize neural networks. Our work challenges the prevailing assumption that gradient-based optimization is the only viable approach for training neural networks. It also holds significant potential to reduce the computational cost of training large language models, thereby enabling groups with limited computational resources to participate in deep learning research.

Abstract: Multimodal text-to-image generation remains constrained by the difficulty of maintaining semantic alignment and professional-level detail across diverse visual domains. We propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that coordinates domain-specialized agents (e.g., focused on architecture, portraiture, and landscape imagery) within two coupled subsystems: a text enhancement module and an image generation module, each augmented with multimodal integration components. Agents are trained using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) under a composite reward function that balances semantic similarity, linguistic visual quality, and content diversity. Cross-modal alignment is enforced through contrastive learning, bidirectional attention, and iterative feedback between text and image. Across six experimental settings, our system significantly enriches generated content (word count increased by 1614%) while reducing ROUGE-1 scores by 69.7%. Among fusion methods, Transformer-based strategies achieve the highest composite score (0.521), despite occasional stability issues. Multimodal ensembles yield moderate consistency (ranging from 0.444 to 0.481), reflecting the persistent challenges of cross-modal semantic grounding. These findings underscore the promise of collaborative, specialization-driven architectures for advancing reliable multimodal generative systems.

Through APLR's interpretations, factors such as time management, concentration abilities, perceived helpfulness to classmates, and participation in offline courses are identified as significant influencers of learning satisfaction.

Abstract: Although student learning satisfaction has been widely studied, modern techniques such as interpretable machine learning and neural networks have not been sufficiently explored. This study demonstrates that a recent model that combines boosting with interpretability, automatic piecewise linear regression(APLR), offers the best fit for predicting learning satisfaction among several state-of-the-art approaches. Through the analysis of APLR's numerical and visual interpretations, students' time management and concentration abilities, perceived helpfulness to classmates, and participation in offline courses have the most significant positive impact on learning satisfaction. Surprisingly, involvement in creative activities did not positively affect learning satisfaction. Moreover, the contributing factors can be interpreted on an individual level, allowing educators to customize instructions according to student profiles.

Abstract: Online ride-hailing platforms aim to deliver efficient mobility-on-demand services, often facing challenges in balancing dynamic and spatially heterogeneous supply and demand. Existing methods typically fall into two categories: reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, which suffer from data inefficiency, oversimplified modeling of real-world dynamics, and difficulty enforcing operational constraints; or decomposed online optimization methods, which rely on manually designed high-level objectives that lack awareness of low-level routing dynamics. To address this issue, we propose a novel hybrid framework that integrates large language model (LLM) with mathematical optimization in a dynamic hierarchical system: (1) it is training-free, removing the need for large-scale interaction data as in RL, and (2) it leverages LLM to bridge cognitive limitations caused by problem decomposition by adaptively generating high-level objectives. Within this framework, LLM serves as a meta-optimizer, producing semantic heuristics that guide a low-level optimizer responsible for constraint enforcement and real-time decision execution. These heuristics are refined through a closed-loop evolutionary process, driven by harmony search, which iteratively adapts the LLM prompts based on feasibility and performance feedback from the optimization layer. Extensive experiments based on scenarios derived from both the New York and Chicago taxi datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving an average improvement of 16% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Summary: 
UCAS is a new model-free method designed to enhance reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards in large language models like GRPO. By leveraging the model's internal uncertainty signals, UCAS refines credit assignment to better balance exploration-exploitation trade-offs. It operates in two stages, modulating response-level advantage based on self-confidence and applying a token-level penalty determined by raw logit certainty. Through extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks across multiple model scales, UCAS outperforms strong RLVR baselines, including 1.5B and 7B models. The results show that UCAS not only achieves higher rewards but also promotes reasoning diversity and effectively mitigates entropy collapse. <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has shown significant promise for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, prevailing algorithms like GRPO broadcast a uniform advantage signal across all tokens in a sequence. This coarse-grained approach overlooks the pivotal role of uncertain, high-stakes decisions during reasoning, leading to inefficient exploration and the well-documented problem of entropy collapse. To address this, we introduce UnCertainty-aware Advantage Shaping (UCAS), a model-free method that refines credit assignment by leveraging the model's internal uncertainty signals. UCAS operates in two stages: it first modulates the response-level advantage using the model's overall self-confidence, and then applies a token-level penalty based on raw logit certainty. This dual mechanism encourages exploration of high-uncertainty paths that yield correct answers while penalizing overconfident yet erroneous reasoning, effectively balancing the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Extensive experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that UCAS significantly outperforms strong RLVR baselines across multiple model scales, including 1.5B and 7B. Our analysis confirms that UCAS not only achieves higher rewards but also promotes greater reasoning diversity and successfully mitigates entropy collapse.

Abstract: Generative Agentic AI systems are emerging as a powerful paradigm for automating complex, multi-step tasks. However, many existing frameworks for building these systems introduce significant complexity, a steep learning curve, and substantial boilerplate code, hindering rapid prototyping and deployment. This paper introduces simpliflow, a lightweight, open-source Python framework designed to address these challenges. simpliflow enables the rapid development and orchestration of linear, deterministic agentic workflows through a declarative, JSON-based configuration. Its modular architecture decouples agent management, workflow execution, and post-processing, promoting ease of use and extensibility. By integrating with LiteLLM, it supports over 100 Large Language Models (LLMs) out-of-the-box. We present the architecture, operational flow, and core features of simpliflow, demonstrating its utility through diverse use cases ranging from software development simulation to real-time system interaction. A comparative analysis with prominent frameworks like LangChain and AutoGen highlights simpliflow's unique position as a tool optimized for simplicity, control, and speed in deterministic workflow environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated substantial potential in video understanding. However, existing benchmarks fail to comprehensively evaluate synergistic reasoning capabilities across audio and visual modalities, often neglecting either one of the modalities or integrating them in a logically inconsistent manner. To bridge this gap, we introduce OmniVideoBench, a large-scale and rigorously designed benchmark dedicated to assessing synergistic audio-visual understanding, with a strong emphasis on modality complementarity and logical consistency. Specifically, OmniVideoBench comprises 1000 high-quality question-answer(QA) pairs, each annotated with step-by-step reasoning traces, derived from 628 diverse videos ranging from several seconds to 30 minutes, and manually verified to guarantee complete correctness and uniqueness. Moreover, OmniVideoBench encompasses 13 carefully designed question types, covering temporal reasoning, spatial localization, counting, causal inference, summarization, and beyond, thereby capturing the essential challenges of video understanding. Evaluation of multiple MLLMs on OmniVideoBench reveals a pronounced gap between model performance and human reasoning, with open-source models lagging significantly behind their closed-source counterparts, underscoring the inherent difficulty of genuine audio-visual reasoning. We will release OmniVideoBench to foster the development of MLLMs with stronger and more generalizable reasoning capabilities.

Summary:<br>
Automated deduction is crucial in artificial intelligence, but balancing deductive completeness with computational efficiency remains a challenge. The Contradiction Separation Extension (CSE) framework proposed a dynamic multi-clause reasoning theory in 2018, focusing on contradiction separation instead of pairwise resolution. This work introduces the Extended Triangular Method (ETM), formalizing and extending contradiction separation algorithms. ETM unifies various contradiction-building strategies in a geometric framework, enhancing flexibility and synergy in clause interaction. ETM serves as the core algorithm in high-performance theorem provers like CSE and CSI-E, demonstrating competitive results in standard benchmarks. By bridging theory and implementation, ETM advances the contradiction separation paradigm, providing a scalable and effective model for automated reasoning. This work opens new avenues for research in logical inference and theorem proving.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Automated deduction lies at the core of Artificial Intelligence (AI), underpinning theorem proving, formal verification, and logical reasoning. Despite decades of progress, reconciling deductive completeness with computational efficiency remains an enduring challenge. Traditional reasoning calculi, grounded in binary resolution, restrict inference to pairwise clause interactions and thereby limit deductive synergy among multiple clauses. The Contradiction Separation Extension (CSE) framework, introduced in 2018, proposed a dynamic multi-clause reasoning theory that redefined logical inference as a process of contradiction separation rather than sequential resolution. While that work established the theoretical foundation, its algorithmic realization remained unformalized and unpublished. This work presents the Extended Triangular Method (ETM), a generalized contradiction-construction algorithm that formalizes and extends the internal mechanisms of contradiction separation. The ETM unifies multiple contradiction-building strategies, including the earlier Standard Extension method, within a triangular geometric framework that supports flexible clause interaction and dynamic synergy. ETM serves as the algorithmic core of several high-performance theorem provers, CSE, CSE-E, CSI-E, and CSI-Enig, whose competitive results in standard first-order benchmarks (TPTP problem sets and CASC 2018-2015) empirically validate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed approach. By bridging theoretical abstraction and operational implementation, ETM advances the contradiction separation paradigm into a generalized, scalable, and practically competitive model for automated reasoning, offering new directions for future research in logical inference and theorem proving.

Summary:
- Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with complex logical reasoning and their performance is highly dependent on translating natural language (NL) problems into a symbolic language (SL).
- Different NL logical reasoning problems correspond to different optimal SL formalizations for translation.
- The study proposes adaptive selection of the most suitable SL for each problem prior to translation to improve logical reasoning performance of LLMs.
- The methods involve selecting the target SL among first-order logic, logic programming, and Boolean satisfiability and then translating the problem from NL to target SL expressions using LLMs.
- Experimental results show that the adaptive selection method significantly outperforms translating all problems into a single SL and randomly selecting the SL, achieving 96% accuracy on a mixed dataset. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle with complex logical reasoning. While previous works achieve remarkable improvements, their performance is highly dependent on the correctness of translating natural language (NL) problems into a symbolic language (SL). Though numerous works focusing on improving this translation accuracy, they only consider the similarity between the meaning of SL and NL, overlooking another crucial influencing factor, the selection of the target SL type itself. For example, first-order logic language specializes in logical reasoning with categorical syllogisms and complex quantifiers, while Boolean satisfiability formalism excels at representing constraint satisfaction like partial problems. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to claim and verify that different NL logical reasoning problem corresponds to different optimal SL formalization for translation. Based on this, we propose a methods to improve the logical reasoning performance of LLMs by adaptively selecting the most suitable SL for each problem prior to translation. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to select the target SL among first-order logic, logic programming and Boolean satisfiability and then translate the problem in NL to target SL expressions as well as employ the corresponding logical solver to derive the final answer. Experimental results on benchmarks show that our adaptive selection method significantly outperforms translating all into single SL and randomly selecting the SL. On a mixed dataset of these benchmarks, our approach achieves 96% accuracy, which improving performance by 25% compared to the second highest accuracy from the first-order logic translation.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, strategic thinking, belief-coherent behavior, meta-reasoning, heuristic formation

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) are being used in domains requiring reasoning about agents' behavior. This study explores whether LLMs exhibit genuine strategic thinking, involving beliefs about others, evaluation of actions, and choice based on those beliefs. The framework developed disentangles beliefs, evaluation, and choice in games, showing that current models demonstrate belief-coherent best-response behavior at targeted reasoning depths. The models self-limit their depth of reasoning, form differentiated conjectures about opponents, and display an emergent form of meta-reasoning. As complexity increases, explicit recursion gives way to internally generated heuristic rules of choice, distinct from human biases. This shows how language modeling objectives can lead to the emergence of belief coherence, meta-reasoning, and novel heuristic formation in artificial agents. <br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to domains that require reasoning about other agents' behavior, such as negotiation, policy design, and market simulation, yet existing research has mostly evaluated their adherence to equilibrium play or their exhibited depth of reasoning. Whether they display genuine strategic thinking, understood as the coherent formation of beliefs about other agents, evaluation of possible actions, and choice based on those beliefs, remains unexplored. We develop a framework to identify this ability by disentangling beliefs, evaluation, and choice in static, complete-information games, and apply it across a series of non-cooperative environments. By jointly analyzing models' revealed choices and reasoning traces, and introducing a new context-free game to rule out imitation from memorization, we show that current frontier models exhibit belief-coherent best-response behavior at targeted reasoning depths. When unconstrained, they self-limit their depth of reasoning and form differentiated conjectures about human and synthetic opponents, revealing an emergent form of meta-reasoning. Under increasing complexity, explicit recursion gives way to internally generated heuristic rules of choice that are stable, model-specific, and distinct from known human biases. These findings indicate that belief coherence, meta-reasoning, and novel heuristic formation can emerge jointly from language modeling objectives, providing a structured basis for the study of strategic cognition in artificial agents.

<div> DRIFT framework, Large Language Models, mathematical autoformalization, premise retrieval, illustrative theorems <br>
Summary: <br>
The DRIFT framework aims to improve the formalization of mathematical statements by helping Large Language Models (LLMs) decompose complex informal statements into smaller, more manageable components. By enabling targeted retrieval of necessary mathematical premises from libraries like Mathlib and providing illustrative theorems for better understanding, DRIFT significantly enhances premise retrieval performance. Evaluation on various benchmarks shows that DRIFT outperforms existing methods, nearly doubling the F1 score on ProofNet and achieving substantial improvements on the ConNF benchmark. The effectiveness of mathematical autoformalization heavily relies on adaptive retrieval strategies tailored to each model's specific capabilities, emphasizing the importance of aligning retrieval methods with the model's knowledge boundaries. <br> <div>
arXiv:2510.10815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automating the formalization of mathematical statements for theorem proving remains a major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs struggle to identify and utilize the prerequisite mathematical knowledge and its corresponding formal representation in languages like Lean. Current retrieval-augmented autoformalization methods query external libraries using the informal statement directly, but overlook a fundamental limitation: informal mathematical statements are often complex and offer limited context on the underlying math concepts. To address this, we introduce DRIFT, a novel framework that enables LLMs to decompose informal mathematical statements into smaller, more tractable ''sub-components''. This facilitates targeted retrieval of premises from mathematical libraries such as Mathlib. Additionally, DRIFT retrieves illustrative theorems to help models use premises more effectively in formalization tasks. We evaluate DRIFT across diverse benchmarks (ProofNet, ConNF, and MiniF2F-test) and find that it consistently improves premise retrieval, nearly doubling the F1 score compared to the DPR baseline on ProofNet. Notably, DRIFT demonstrates strong performance on the out-of-distribution ConNF benchmark, with BEq+@10 improvements of 37.14% and 42.25% using GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3.1, respectively. Our analysis shows that retrieval effectiveness in mathematical autoformalization depends heavily on model-specific knowledge boundaries, highlighting the need for adaptive retrieval strategies aligned with each model's capabilities.

<div> Keywords: neurosis, embodied AI, behavior, planning, uncertainty handling

Summary: 
The article presents a framework for identifying neurotic behaviors in embodied AI, characterized by internal coherence but misalignment with reality due to interactions between planning, uncertainty handling, and aversive memory. Various modalities of neurosis in a grid navigation system are catalogued, each with corresponding detection methods and escape policies. The persistence of phobic avoidance behavior is explained, even when globally safe routes are available. The authors argue that local fixes may not be sufficient to address global failures in AI systems, advocating for genetic-programming based destructive testing to surface architectural weaknesses. By evolving worlds and perturbations to maximize pressure on system safety, latency, compliance, and efficiency, the testing process reveals the need for architectural revisions rather than simple patches to address underlying issues.

Abstract: We present a framework for characterizing neurosis in embodied AI: behaviors that are internally coherent yet misaligned with reality, arising from interactions among planning, uncertainty handling, and aversive memory. In a grid navigation stack we catalogue recurrent modalities including flip-flop, plan churn, perseveration loops, paralysis and hypervigilance, futile search, belief incoherence, tie break thrashing, corridor thrashing, optimality compulsion, metric mismatch, policy oscillation, and limited-visibility variants. For each we give lightweight online detectors and reusable escape policies (short commitments, a margin to switch, smoothing, principled arbitration). We then show that durable phobic avoidance can persist even under full visibility when learned aversive costs dominate local choice, producing long detours despite globally safe routes. Using First/Second/Third Law as engineering shorthand for safety latency, command compliance, and resource efficiency, we argue that local fixes are insufficient; global failures can remain. To surface them, we propose genetic-programming based destructive testing that evolves worlds and perturbations to maximize law pressure and neurosis scores, yielding adversarial curricula and counterfactual traces that expose where architectural revision, not merely symptom-level patches, is required.

Abstract: Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols, essential for wireless networks, are typically manually configured. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based protocols enhance task-specified network performance, they suffer from poor generalizability and resilience, demanding costly retraining to adapt to dynamic environments. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a game-theoretic LLM-empowered multi-agent DRL (MARL) framework, in which the uplink transmission between a base station and a varying number of user equipments is modeled as a dynamic multi-follower Stackelberg game (MFSG), capturing the network's natural hierarchical structure. Within this game, LLM-driven agents, coordinated through proximal policy optimization (PPO), synthesize adaptive, semantic MAC protocols in response to network dynamics. Protocol action grammar (PAG) is employed to ensure the reliability and efficiency of this process. Under this system, we further analyze the existence and convergence behavior in terms of a Stackelberg equilibrium by studying the learning dynamics of LLM-empowered unified policies in response to changing followers. Simulations corroborate that our framework achieves a 77.6% greater throughput and a 65.2% fairness improvement over conventional baselines. Besides, our framework generalizes excellently to a fluctuating number of users without requiring retraining or architectural changes.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning on the web-scale scientific literature is a crucial touchstone for large language model (LLM) based agents designed to support complex knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing works are mainly restricted to tool-free tasks within isolated papers, largely due to the lack of a benchmark for cross-paper reasoning and multi-tool orchestration in real research scenarios. In this work, we propose PaperArena, an evaluation benchmark for agents to address real-world research questions that typically require integrating information across multiple papers with the assistance of external tools. Given a research question, agents should integrate diverse formats across multiple papers through reasoning and interacting with appropriate tools, thereby producing a well-grounded answer. To support standardized evaluation, we provide a modular and extensible platform for agent execution, offering tools such as multimodal parsing, context retrieval, and programmatic computation. Experimental results reveal that even the most advanced LLM powering a well-established agent system achieves merely 38.78% average accuracy. On the hard subset, accuracy drops to only 18.47%, highlighting great potential for improvement. We also present several empirical findings, including that all agents tested exhibit inefficient tool usage, often invoking more tools than necessary to solve a task. We invite the community to adopt PaperArena to develop and evaluate more capable agents for scientific discovery. Our code and data are available https://github.com/Melmaphother/PaperArena.

Summary: 
Proof-of-Use (PoU) addresses Tool-Call Hacking in Retrieval-augmented generation agents by enforcing verifiable causal links between evidence, reasoning, and answers. PoU combines syntactic citation validation, sensitivity rewards, and answer-evidence alignment to ensure interpretable and grounded tool usage.

arXiv:2510.10931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) agents, such as recent DeepResearch-style systems, extend large language models (LLMs) with autonomous information-seeking capabilities through external tools. While reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled impressive multi-step reasoning, we identify a previously overlooked failure mode, Tool-Call Hacking, where agents inflate reward signals by issuing superficially correct tool calls without genuinely leveraging the retrieved evidence. This results in (i) mode collapse into repetitive reliance on a single source and (ii) spurious grounding, where answers are only weakly supported by cited content.
  To address this, we propose Proof-of-Use (PoU), an evidence-grounded RL framework that enforces verifiable causal links between retrieved evidence, reasoning traces, and final answers. PoU operationalizes this through a unified step-wise contract combining syntactic citation validation, perturbation-based sensitivity rewards, and answer-evidence alignment objectives, ensuring that tool usage remains both interpretable and functionally grounded.
  Across seven QA benchmarks spanning in-domain, out-of-domain, and out-of-tool-distribution settings, PoU consistently outperforms strong DeepResearch baselines in factual accuracy, evidence faithfulness, and tool-routing balance. These findings highlight the necessity of grounding RL-trained agents not merely in task outcomes but in the causal use of retrieved information, offering a principled path toward trustworthy retrieval-augmented reasoning.

Abstract: Modern enterprises manage vast knowledge distributed across heterogeneous systems such as Jira, Git repositories, Confluence, and wikis. Conventional retrieval methods based on keyword search or static embeddings often fail to answer complex queries that require contextual reasoning and multi-hop inference across artifacts. We present a modular hybrid retrieval framework for adaptive enterprise information access that integrates Knowledge Base Language-Augmented Models (KBLam), DeepGraph representations, and embedding-driven semantic search. The framework builds a unified knowledge graph from parsed repositories including code, pull requests, and commit histories, enabling semantic similarity search, structural inference, and multi-hop reasoning. Query analysis dynamically determines the optimal retrieval strategy, supporting both structured and unstructured data sources through independent or fused processing. An interactive interface provides graph visualizations, subgraph exploration, and context-aware query routing to generate concise and explainable answers. Experiments on large-scale Git repositories show that the unified reasoning layer improves answer relevance by up to 80 percent compared with standalone GPT-based retrieval pipelines. By combining graph construction, hybrid reasoning, and interactive visualization, the proposed framework offers a scalable, explainable, and user-centric foundation for intelligent knowledge assistants in enterprise environments.

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has demonstrated strong semantic understanding capabilities, but struggles to perform precise spatio-temporal understanding. Existing spatio-temporal methods primarily focus on the video itself, while overlooking the physical information within the video, such as multi-object layouts and motion. Such limitations restrict the use of MLLMs in downstream applications that demand high precision, including embodied intelligence and VR. To address this issue, we present Video-STR, a novel graph-based reinforcement method for precise Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning. Building upon the capacity of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) to improve model abilities, we introduce a reasoning mechanism using graph-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) method to guide the model in inferring the underlying spatio-temporal topology of scenarios during the thinking process. To resolve the lack of spatio-temporal training data, we construct the STV-205k dataset with 205k question-answering pairs, covering dynamic multi-object scenes in both indoor and outdoor environments, to support the model training. Experiments show that Video-STR achieves state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks, outperforming the base model by 13% on STI-Bench, and demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach and dataset. Code, model, and data will be released.

Abstract: Model merging, typically on Instruct and Thinking models, has shown remarkable performance for efficient reasoning. In this paper, we systematically revisit the simplest merging method that interpolates two weights directly. Particularly, we observe that model interpolation follows a three-stage evolutionary paradigm with distinct behaviors on the reasoning trajectory. These dynamics provide a principled guide for navigating the performance-cost trade-off. Empirical results demonstrate that a strategically interpolated model surprisingly surpasses sophisticated model merging baselines on both efficiency and effectiveness. We further validate our findings with extensive ablation studies on model layers, modules, and decoding strategies. Ultimately, this work demystifies model interpolation and offers a practical framework for crafting models with precisely targeted reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: In manufacturing systems, identifying the causes of failures is crucial for maintaining and improving production efficiency. In knowledge-based failure-cause inference, it is important that the knowledge base (1) explicitly structures knowledge about the target system and about failures, and (2) contains sufficiently long causal chains of failures. In this study, we constructed Diagnostic Knowledge Ontology and proposed a Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) model-based maintenance-record accumulation method based on it. Failure-cause inference using the maintenance records accumulated by the proposed method showed better agreement with the set of candidate causes enumerated by experts, especially in difficult cases where the number of related cases is small and the vocabulary used differs. In the future, it will be necessary to develop inference methods tailored to these maintenance records, build a user interface, and carry out validation on larger and more diverse systems. Additionally, this approach leverages the understanding and knowledge of the target in the design phase to support knowledge accumulation and problem solving during the maintenance phase, and it is expected to become a foundation for knowledge sharing across the entire engineering chain in the future.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly deployed in legal contexts, where their opacity raises significant challenges for fairness, accountability, and trust. The so-called ``black box problem'' undermines the legitimacy of automated decision-making, as affected individuals often lack access to meaningful explanations. In response, the field of Explainable AI (XAI) has proposed a variety of methods to enhance transparency, ranging from example-based and rule-based techniques to hybrid and argumentation-based approaches. This paper promotes computational models of arguments and their role in providing legally relevant explanations, with particular attention to their alignment with emerging regulatory frameworks such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA). We analyze the strengths and limitations of different explanation strategies, evaluate their applicability to legal reasoning, and highlight how argumentation frameworks -- by capturing the defeasible, contestable, and value-sensitive nature of law -- offer a particularly robust foundation for explainable legal AI. Finally, we identify open challenges and research directions, including bias mitigation, empirical validation in judicial settings, and compliance with evolving ethical and legal standards, arguing that computational argumentation is best positioned to meet both technical and normative requirements of transparency in the law domain.

Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, socio-economic systems are entering a new stage of "human-AI co-creation." Building upon a previously established multi-level intelligent agent economic model, this paper conducts simulation-based comparisons of macroeconomic output evolution in China and the United States under different mechanisms-AI collaboration, network effects, and AI autonomous production. The results show that: (1) when AI functions as an independent productive entity, the overall growth rate of social output far exceeds that of traditional human-labor-based models; (2) China demonstrates clear potential for acceleration in both the expansion of intelligent agent populations and the pace of technological catch-up, offering the possibility of achieving technological convergence or even partial surpassing. This study provides a systematic, model-based analytical framework for understanding AI-driven production system transformation and shifts in international competitiveness, as well as quantitative insights for relevant policy formulation.

Abstract: The steady growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has accelerated in the recent years, facilitated by the development of sophisticated models such as large language models and foundation models. Ensuring robust and reliable power infrastructures is fundamental to take advantage of the full potential of AI. However, AI data centres are extremely hungry for power, putting the problem of their power management in the spotlight, especially with respect to their impact on environment and sustainable development. In this work, we investigate the capacity and limits of solutions based on an innovative approach for the power management of AI data centres, i.e., making part of the input power as dynamic as the power used for data-computing functions. The performance of passive and active devices are quantified and compared in terms of computational gain, energy efficiency, reduction of capital expenditure, and management costs by analysing power trends from multiple data platforms worldwide. This strategy, which identifies a paradigm shift in the AI data centre power management, has the potential to strongly improve the sustainability of AI hyperscalers, enhancing their footprint on environmental, financial, and societal fields.

<title>Spec-Driven AI for Science: The ARIA Framework for Automated and Reproducible Data Analysis</title>

Abstract: The rapid expansion of scientific data has widened the gap between analytical capability and research intent. Existing AI-based analysis tools, ranging from AutoML frameworks to agentic research assistants, either favor automation over transparency or depend on manual scripting that hinders scalability and reproducibility. We present ARIA (Automated Research Intelligence Assistant), a spec-driven, human-in-the-loop framework for automated and interpretable data analysis. ARIA integrates six interoperable layers, namely Command, Context, Code, Data, Orchestration, and AI Module, within a document-centric workflow that unifies human reasoning and machine execution. Through natural-language specifications, researchers define analytical goals while ARIA autonomously generates executable code, validates computations, and produces transparent documentation. Beyond achieving high predictive accuracy, ARIA can rapidly identify optimal feature sets and select suitable models, minimizing redundant tuning and repetitive experimentation. In the Boston Housing case, ARIA discovered 25 key features and determined XGBoost as the best performing model (R square = 0.93) with minimal overfitting. Evaluations across heterogeneous domains demonstrate ARIA's strong performance, interpretability, and efficiency compared with state-of-the-art systems. By combining AI for research and AI for science principles within a spec-driven architecture, ARIA establishes a new paradigm for transparent, collaborative, and reproducible scientific discovery.

Abstract: An agent facing a planning problem can use answers to how-to questions to reduce uncertainty and fill knowledge gaps, helping it solve both current and future tasks. However, their open ended nature, where valid answers to "How do I X?" range from executable actions to high-level descriptions of X's sub-goals, makes them challenging for AI agents to ask, and for AI experts to answer, in ways that support efficient planning. We introduce $How^{2}$, a memory agent framework that enables agents to ask how-to questions, store the answers, and reuse them for lifelong learning in interactive environments. We evaluate our approach in Plancraft, a Minecraft crafting environment, where agents must complete an assembly task by manipulating inventory items. Using teacher models that answer at varying levels of abstraction, from executable action sequences to high-level subgoal descriptions, we show that lifelong learning agents benefit most from answers that are abstracted and decoupled from the current state. $How^{2}$ offers a way for LLM-based agents to improve their planning capabilities over time by asking questions in interactive environments.

<title>Aligning Deep Implicit Preferences by Learning to Reason Defensively</title>

arXiv:2510.11194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized alignment is crucial for enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to engage effectively in user-centric interactions. However, current methods face a dual challenge: they fail to infer users' deep implicit preferences (including unstated goals, semantic context and risk tolerances), and they lack the defensive reasoning required to navigate real-world ambiguity. This cognitive gap leads to responses that are superficial, brittle and short-sighted. To address this, we propose Critique-Driven Reasoning Alignment (CDRA), which reframes alignment from a scalar reward-matching task into a structured reasoning process. First, to bridge the preference inference gap, we introduce the DeepPref benchmark. This dataset, comprising 3000 preference-query pairs across 20 topics, is curated by simulating a multi-faceted cognitive council that produces critique-annotated reasoning chains to deconstruct query semantics and reveal latent risks. Second, to instill defensive reasoning, we introduce the Personalized Generative Process Reward Model (Pers-GenPRM), which frames reward modeling as a personalized reasoning task. It generates a critique chain to evaluate a response's alignment with user preferences before outputting a final score based on this rationale. Ultimately, this interpretable, structured reward signal guides policy model through Critique-Driven Policy Alignment, a process-level online reinforcement learning algorithm integrating both numerical and natural language feedback. Experiments demonstrate that CDRA excels at discovering and aligning with users' true preferences while executing robust reasoning. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Zephyrian-Hugh/Deep-pref.

<title>AI Alignment Strategies from a Risk Perspective: Independent Safety Mechanisms or Shared Failures?</title>

Abstract: AI alignment research aims to develop techniques to ensure that AI systems do not cause harm. However, every alignment technique has failure modes, which are conditions in which there is a non-negligible chance that the technique fails to provide safety. As a strategy for risk mitigation, the AI safety community has increasingly adopted a defense-in-depth framework: Conceding that there is no single technique which guarantees safety, defense-in-depth consists in having multiple redundant protections against safety failure, such that safety can be maintained even if some protections fail. However, the success of defense-in-depth depends on how (un)correlated failure modes are across alignment techniques. For example, if all techniques had the exact same failure modes, the defense-in-depth approach would provide no additional protection at all. In this paper, we analyze 7 representative alignment techniques and 7 failure modes to understand the extent to which they overlap. We then discuss our results' implications for understanding the current level of risk and how to prioritize AI alignment research in the future.

<title>PADME: Procedure Aware DynaMic Execution</title>

Abstract: Learning to autonomously execute long-horizon procedures from natural language remains a core challenge for intelligent agents. Free-form instructions such as recipes, scientific protocols, or business workflows encode rich procedural knowledge, but their variability and lack of structure cause agents driven by large language models (LLMs) to drift or fail during execution. We introduce Procedure Aware DynaMic Execution (PADME), an agent framework that produces and exploits a graph-based representation of procedures. Unlike prior work that relies on manual graph construction or unstructured reasoning, PADME autonomously transforms procedural text into executable graphs that capture task dependencies, decision points, and reusable subroutines. Central to PADME is a two-phase methodology; Teach phase, which focuses on systematic structuring, enrichment with executable logic of procedures, followed by Execute phase, which enables dynamic execution in response to real-time inputs and environment feedback. This separation ensures quality assurance and scalability, allowing expert knowledge to be encoded once and reliably reused across varying contexts. The graph representation also provides an inductive bias that reduces error accumulation in long-horizon reasoning, underscoring the importance of structured procedure modeling for reliable agent-driven automation. Empirically, PADME achieves state-of-the-art performance on four diverse benchmarks, including ALFWorld and ScienceWorld. These results demonstrate that agents equipped with graph-based procedure representations offer a powerful intermediate abstraction for robust and generalizable execution.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Agents are increasingly pivotal in simulating and understanding complex human systems and interactions. We propose the AI-Agent School (AAS) system, built around a self-evolving mechanism that leverages agents for simulating complex educational dynamics. Addressing the fragmented issues in teaching process modeling and the limitations of agents performance in simulating diverse educational participants, AAS constructs the Zero-Exp strategy, employs a continuous "experience-reflection-optimization" cycle, grounded in a dual memory base comprising experience and knowledge bases and incorporating short-term and long-term memory components. Through this mechanism, agents autonomously evolve via situated interactions within diverse simulated school scenarios. This evolution enables agents to more accurately model the nuanced, multi-faceted teacher-student engagements and underlying learning processes found in physical schools. Experiment confirms that AAS can effectively simulate intricate educational dynamics and is effective in fostering advanced agent cognitive abilities, providing a foundational stepping stone from the "Era of Experience" to the "Era of Simulation" by generating high-fidelity behavioral and interaction data.

Abstract: This paper investigates automated skill decomposition using Large Language Models (LLMs) and proposes a rigorous, ontology-grounded evaluation framework. Our framework standardizes the pipeline from prompting and generation to normalization and alignment with ontology nodes. To evaluate outputs, we introduce two metrics: a semantic F1-score that uses optimal embedding-based matching to assess content accuracy, and a hierarchy-aware F1-score that credits structurally correct placements to assess granularity. We conduct experiments on ROME-ESCO-DecompSkill, a curated subset of parents, comparing two prompting strategies: zero-shot and leakage-safe few-shot with exemplars. Across diverse LLMs, zero-shot offers a strong baseline, while few-shot consistently stabilizes phrasing and granularity and improves hierarchy-aware alignment. A latency analysis further shows that exemplar-guided prompts are competitive - and sometimes faster - than unguided zero-shot due to more schema-compliant completions. Together, the framework, benchmark, and metrics provide a reproducible foundation for developing ontology-faithful skill decomposition systems.

Abstract: Anemia, a condition marked by insufficient levels of red blood cells or hemoglobin, remains a widespread health issue affecting millions of individuals globally. Accurate and timely diagnosis is essential for effective management and treatment of anemia. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of artificial intelligence techniques, i.e., machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) for the detection, classification, and diagnosis of anemia. This paper provides a systematic review of the recent advancements in this field, with a focus on various models applied to anemia detection. The review also compares these models based on several performance metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision. By analyzing these metrics, the paper evaluates the strengths and limitation of discussed models in detecting and classifying anemia, emphasizing the importance of addressing these factors to improve diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract: Improving the multi-step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical yet challenging task. The dominant paradigm, outcome-supervised reinforcement learning (RLVR), rewards only correct final answers, often propagating flawed reasoning and suffering from sparse reward signals. While process-level reward models (PRMs) provide denser, step-by-step feedback, they lack generalizability and interpretability, requiring task-specific segmentation of the reasoning process. To this end, we propose the Dimension-level Reward Model (DRM), a new supervision framework that bridges the gap between these two approaches. DRM evaluates the quality of a reasoning process along three fundamental, complementary, and interpretable dimensions: Confidence for uncertainty calibration, Relevance for semantic alignment, and Coherence for logical consistency. Together, these dimensions capture aspects beyond final answer correctness and enable interpretable assessment without requiring ground truth answers. Experimental results show that DRM provides effective supervision signals, guides the optimization of LLMs and enhances their reasoning ability. In particular, DRM-supervised training achieves consistent gains on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution open-domain tasks, including mathematics, question answering, code execution, and puzzles. Our findings demonstrate that multidimensional supervision of the reasoning process can improve the generalized reasoning ability of LLMs beyond the training distribution.

<title>Unifying Deductive and Abductive Reasoning in Knowledge Graphs with Masked Diffusion Model</title>

Abstract: Deductive and abductive reasoning are two critical paradigms for analyzing knowledge graphs, enabling applications from financial query answering to scientific discovery. Deductive reasoning on knowledge graphs usually involves retrieving entities that satisfy a complex logical query, while abductive reasoning generates plausible logical hypotheses from observations. Despite their clear synergistic potential, where deduction can validate hypotheses and abduction can uncover deeper logical patterns, existing methods address them in isolation. To bridge this gap, we propose DARK, a unified framework for Deductive and Abductive Reasoning in Knowledge graphs. As a masked diffusion model capable of capturing the bidirectional relationship between queries and conclusions, DARK has two key innovations. First, to better leverage deduction for hypothesis refinement during abductive reasoning, we introduce a self-reflective denoising process that iteratively generates and validates candidate hypotheses against the observed conclusion. Second, to discover richer logical associations, we propose a logic-exploration reinforcement learning approach that simultaneously masks queries and conclusions, enabling the model to explore novel reasoning compositions. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark knowledge graphs show that DARK achieves state-of-the-art performance on both deductive and abductive reasoning tasks, demonstrating the significant benefits of our unified approach.

Abstract: Governance of data, compliance, and business privacy matters, particularly for healthcare and finance businesses. Since the recent emergence of AI enterprise AI assistants enhancing business productivity, safeguarding private data and compliance is now a priority. With the implementation of AI assistants across the enterprise, the zero data retention can be achieved by implementing zero data retention policies by Large Language Model businesses like Open AI and Anthropic and Meta. In this work, we explore zero data retention policies for the Enterprise apps of large language models (LLMs). Our key contribution is defining the architectural, compliance, and usability trade-offs of such systems in parallel. In this research work, we examine the development of commercial AI assistants with two industry leaders and market titans in this arena - Salesforce and Microsoft. Both of these companies used distinct technical architecture to support zero data retention policies. Salesforce AgentForce and Microsoft Copilot are among the leading AI assistants providing much-needed push to business productivity in customer care. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the technical architecture and deployment of zero data retention policy by consuming applications as well as big language models service providers like Open Ai, Anthropic, and Meta.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems rely on in-context policy documents encoding diverse business rules. As requirements grow, these documents expand rapidly, causing high computational overhead. This motivates developing internalization methods that embed policy documents into model priors while preserving performance. Prior prompt compression work targets generic prompts, but agentic policy documents span multiple complexity levels and require deeper reasoning, making internalization harder. We introduce CC-Gen, an agentic benchmark generator with Controllable Complexity across four levels, enabling systematic evaluation of agents' ability to handle complexity and offering a unified framework for assessing policy internalization. Our analysis shows that complex policy specifications governing workflows pose major reasoning challenges. Supporting internalization with gold user agent interaction trajectories containing chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is data-intensive and degrades sharply as policy complexity increases. To mitigate data and reasoning burdens, we propose Category-Aware Policy Continued Pretraining (CAP-CPT). Our automated pipeline parses policy documents to extract key specifications, grouping them into factual, behavioral, and conditional categories, and isolating complex conditions that drive workflow complexity. This guides targeted data synthesis and enables agents to internalize policy information through an autoregressive pretraining loss. Experiments show CAP-CPT improves SFT baselines in all settings, with up to 41% and 22% gains on Qwen-3-32B, achieving 97.3% prompt length reduction on CC-Gen and further enhancing tau-Bench with minimal SFT data.

Abstract: AI policymakers are responsible for delivering effective governance mechanisms that can provide safe, aligned and trustworthy AI development. However, the information environment offered to policymakers is characterised by an unnecessarily low Signal-To-Noise Ratio, favouring regulatory capture and creating deep uncertainty and divides on which risks should be prioritised from a governance perspective. We posit that the current publication speeds in AI combined with the lack of strong scientific standards, via weak reproducibility protocols, effectively erodes the power of policymakers to enact meaningful policy and governance protocols. Our paper outlines how AI research could adopt stricter reproducibility guidelines to assist governance endeavours and improve consensus on the AI risk landscape. We evaluate the forthcoming reproducibility crisis within AI research through the lens of crises in other scientific domains; providing a commentary on how adopting preregistration, increased statistical power and negative result publication reproducibility protocols can enable effective AI governance. While we maintain that AI governance must be reactive due to AI's significant societal implications we argue that policymakers and governments must consider reproducibility protocols as a core tool in the governance arsenal and demand higher standards for AI research.

Abstract: In online retail, customer acquisition typically incurs higher costs than customer retention, motivating firms to invest in churn analytics. However, many contemporary churn models operate as opaque black boxes, limiting insight into the determinants of attrition, the timing of retention opportunities, and the identification of high-risk customer segments. Accordingly, the emphasis should shift from prediction alone to the design of personalized retention strategies grounded in interpretable evidence. This study advances a three-component framework that integrates explainable AI to quantify feature contributions, survival analysis to model time-to-event churn risk, and RFM profiling to segment customers by transactional behaviour. In combination, these methods enable the attribution of churn drivers, estimation of intervention windows, and prioritization of segments for targeted actions, thereby supporting strategies that reduce attrition and strengthen customer loyalty.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning abilities for planning long-horizon, real-world tasks, yet existing agent benchmarks focus on task completion while neglecting time efficiency in parallel and asynchronous operations. To address this, we present ParaCook, a benchmark for time-efficient collaborative planning. Inspired by the Overcooked game, ParaCook provides an environment for various challenging interaction planning of multi-agent systems that are instantiated as cooking tasks, with a simplified action space to isolate the core challenge of strategic parallel planning. Through a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that current approaches achieve suboptimal plans, which struggle with parallel actions or coordination. Our analysis also reveals LLMs' potential on abstract tasks where they can focus on high-level parallel optimization. ParaCook provides a scalable evaluation framework with adjustable complexity, establishing a foundation for developing and assessing time efficiency-aware multi-agent planning. The code and data are available at https://github.com/zsq259/ParaCook.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied to scientific equation discovery, leveraging their embedded scientific knowledge for hypothesis generation. However, current methods typically confine LLMs to the role of an equation proposer within search algorithms like genetic programming. In this paper, we present SR-Scientist, a framework that elevates the LLM from a simple equation proposer to an autonomous AI scientist that writes code to analyze data, implements the equation as code, submits it for evaluation, and optimizes the equation based on experimental feedback. Specifically, we wrap the code interpreter into a set of tools for data analysis and equation evaluation. The agent is instructed to optimize the equation by utilizing these tools over a long horizon with minimal human-defined pipelines. Empirical results show that SR-Scientist outperforms baseline methods by an absolute margin of 6% to 35% on datasets covering four science disciplines. Additionally, we demonstrate our method's robustness to noise, the generalization of the discovered equations to out-of-domain data, and their symbolic accuracy. Furthermore, we develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework to enhance the agent's capabilities.

Abstract: We present Operand Quant, a single-agent, IDE-based architecture for autonomous machine learning engineering (MLE). Operand Quant departs from conventional multi-agent orchestration frameworks by consolidating all MLE lifecycle stages -- exploration, modeling, experimentation, and deployment -- within a single, context-aware agent. On the MLE-Benchmark (2025), Operand Quant achieved a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) result, with an overall medal rate of 0.3956 +/- 0.0565 across 75 problems -- the highest recorded performance among all evaluated systems to date. The architecture demonstrates that a linear, non-blocking agent, operating autonomously within a controlled IDE environment, can outperform multi-agent and orchestrated systems under identical constraints.

Abstract: Since the beginning of the vaccination trial, social media has been flooded with anti-vaccination comments and conspiracy beliefs. As the day passes, the number of COVID- 19 cases increases, and online platforms and a few news portals entertain sharing different conspiracy theories. The most popular conspiracy belief was the link between the 5G network spreading COVID-19 and the Chinese government spreading the virus as a bioweapon, which initially created racial hatred. Although some disbelief has less impact on society, others create massive destruction. For example, the 5G conspiracy led to the burn of the 5G Tower, and belief in the Chinese bioweapon story promoted an attack on the Asian-Americans. Another popular conspiracy belief was that Bill Gates spread this Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by launching a mass vaccination program to track everyone. This Conspiracy belief creates distrust issues among laypeople and creates vaccine hesitancy. This study aims to discover the conspiracy theory against the vaccine on social platforms. We performed a sentiment analysis on the 598 unique sample comments related to COVID-19 vaccines. We used two different models, BERT and Perspective API, to find out the sentiment and toxicity of the sentence toward the COVID-19 vaccine.

<title>Mission Impossible: Feedback-Guided Dynamic Interactive Planning for Improving Reasoning on LLMs</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in language agents have led to significant improvements in multi-hop reasoning tasks. However, existing approaches often struggle with handling open-domain problems, which require massive information retrieval due to their reliance on a fixed sequence of actions. To address this, we propose Feedback-Guided Dynamic Interactive Planning (FGDIP), a novel framework tailored to enhance reasoning in LLMs by utilizing dynamic and adaptive strategies for information exploration in open-domain multi-hop reasoning tasks. Our approach begins by identifying key entities relevant to the problem, which serve as the initial nodes in the reasoning process. From these initial nodes, we then generate reasoning child nodes with the process being refined through a combination of historical error analysis and real-time feedback, which allows the framework to dynamically adjust and optimize its reasoning strategies. By integrating depth-first search with an innovative node generation technique, our framework adapts based on both prior error paths and concurrently generated nodes at the same hierarchical level. This dynamic strategy effectively expands the search space while ensuring the reasoning process systematically converges toward accurate solutions. Experimental results show that FGDIP achieved up to 54.47% F1 score on the HotpotQA dataset and 70.05% on the StrategyQA dataset, surpassing the best baseline by 5.03% and 7.25% respectively, highlighting its versatility and potential to enhance language agents in multi-hop reasoning tasks.

<title>Causal Digital Twins for Cyber-Physical Security: A Framework for Robust Anomaly Detection in Industrial Control Systems</title>

Abstract: Industrial Control Systems (ICS) face growing cyber-physical attacks that exploit both network vulnerabilities and physical processes. Current anomaly detection methods rely on correlation-based analysis, which cannot separate true causal relationships from spurious associations. This limitation results in high false alarm rates and poor root cause analysis. We propose a novel Causal Digital Twin (CDT) framework for cyber-physical security in medium-scale ICS. Our method combines causal inference theory with digital twin modeling. The framework enables three types of causal reasoning: association for pattern detection, intervention for understanding system responses, and counterfactual analysis for attack prevention planning. We evaluate our framework on three industrial datasets: SWaT, WADI, and HAI, with validation through physical constraint compliance (90.8\%) and synthetic ground truth testing (structural Hamming distance 0.13). Results show significant improvements over seven baseline methods. Our CDT achieves F1-scores are $0.944 \pm 0.014$ for SWaT, $0.902 \pm 0.021$ for WADI, and $0.923 \pm 0.018$ for HAI with statistical significance ($p < 0.0024$, Bonferroni corrected). The framework reduces false positives by \SI{74}{\percent} and achieves \SI{78.4}{\percent} root cause analysis accuracy compared to \SI{48.7}{\percent} for existing methods. Counterfactual analysis enables defense strategies that reduce attack success by \SI{73.2}{\percent}. The system keeps real-time performance with \SI{3.2}{ms} latency, which is suitable for industrial deployment, while providing interpretable explanations for operators.

<title>Toward a Unified Security Framework for AI Agents: Trust, Risk, and Liability</title>

Abstract: The excitement brought by the development of AI agents came alongside arising problems. These concerns centered around users' trust issues towards AIs, the risks involved, and the difficulty of attributing responsibilities and liabilities. Current solutions only attempt to target each problem separately without acknowledging their inter-influential nature. The Trust, Risk and Liability (TRL) framework proposed in this paper, however, ties together the interdependent relationships of trust, risk, and liability to provide a systematic method of building and enhancing trust, analyzing and mitigating risks, and allocating and attributing liabilities. It can be applied to analyze any application scenarios of AI agents and suggest appropriate measures fitting to the context. The implications of the TRL framework lie in its potential societal impacts, economic impacts, ethical impacts, and more. It is expected to bring remarkable values to addressing potential challenges and promoting trustworthy, risk-free, and responsible usage of AI in 6G networks.

Abstract: Hound introduces a relation-first graph engine that improves system-level reasoning across interrelated components in complex codebases. The agent designs flexible, analyst-defined views with compact annotations (e.g., monetary/value flows, authentication/authorization roles, call graphs, protocol invariants) and uses them to anchor exact retrieval: for any question, it loads precisely the code that matters (often across components) so it can zoom out to system structure and zoom in to the decisive lines. A second contribution is a persistent belief system: long-lived vulnerability hypotheses whose confidence is updated as evidence accrues. The agent employs coverage-versus-intuition planning and a QA finalizer to confirm or reject hypotheses. On a five-project subset of ScaBench[1], Hound improves recall and F1 over a baseline LLM analyzer (micro recall 31.2% vs. 8.3%; F1 14.2% vs. 9.8%) with a modest precision trade-off. We attribute these gains to flexible, relation-first graphs that extend model understanding beyond call/dataflow to abstract aspects, plus the hypothesis-centric loop; code and artifacts are released to support reproduction.

Abstract: Despite Artificial Intelligence (AI) transformative potential for public sector services, decision-making, and administrative efficiency, adoption remains uneven due to complex technical, organizational, and institutional challenges. Responsible AI frameworks emphasize fairness, accountability, and transparency, aligning with principles of trustworthy AI and fair AI, yet remain largely aspirational, overlooking technical and institutional realities, especially foundational data and governance. This study addresses this gap by developing a taxonomy of data-related challenges to responsible AI adoption in government. Based on a systematic review of 43 studies and 21 expert evaluations, the taxonomy identifies 13 key challenges across technological, organizational, and environmental dimensions, including poor data quality, limited AI-ready infrastructure, weak governance, misalignment in human-AI decision-making, economic and environmental sustainability concerns. Annotated with institutional pressures, the taxonomy serves as a diagnostic tool to surface 'symptoms' of high-risk AI deployment and guides policymakers in building the institutional and data governance conditions necessary for responsible AI adoption.

Abstract: Selecting a college major is a difficult decision for many incoming freshmen. Traditional academic advising is often hindered by long wait times, intimidating environments, and limited personalization. AI Chatbots present an opportunity to address these challenges. However, AI systems also have the potential to generate biased responses, prejudices related to race, gender, socioeconomic status, and disability. These biases risk turning away potential students and undermining reliability of AI systems. This study aims to develop a University of Maryland (UMD) A. James Clark School of Engineering Program-specific AI chatbot. Our research team analyzed and mitigated potential biases in the responses. Through testing the chatbot on diverse student queries, the responses are scored on metrics of accuracy, relevance, personalization, and bias presence. The results demonstrate that with careful prompt engineering and bias mitigation strategies, AI chatbots can provide high-quality, unbiased academic advising support, achieving mean scores of 9.76 for accuracy, 9.56 for relevance, and 9.60 for personalization with no stereotypical biases found in the sample data. However, due to the small sample size and limited timeframe, our AI model may not fully reflect the nuances of student queries in engineering academic advising. Regardless, these findings will inform best practices for building ethical AI systems in higher education, offering tools to complement traditional advising and address the inequities faced by many underrepresented and first-generation college students.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) has emerged as a successful strategy in industrial-scale recommender systems, offering significant advantages such as capturing diverse users' interests and accurately detecting different behaviors like ``click" or ``dwell time". However, negative transfer and the seesaw phenomenon pose challenges to MTL models due to the complex and often contradictory task correlations in real-world recommendations. To address the problem while making better use of personalized information, we propose a personalized Direct Routing Gradient framework (DRGrad), which consists of three key components: router, updater and personalized gate network. DRGrad judges the stakes between tasks in the training process, which can leverage all valid gradients for the respective task to reduce conflicts. We evaluate the efficiency of DRGrad on complex MTL using a real-world recommendation dataset with 15 billion samples. The results show that DRGrad's superior performance over competing state-of-the-art MTL models, especially in terms of AUC (Area Under the Curve) metrics, indicating that it effectively manages task conflicts in multi-task learning environments without increasing model complexity, while also addressing the deficiencies in noise processing. Moreover, experiments on the public Census-income dataset and Synthetic dataset, have demonstrated the capability of DRGrad in judging and routing the stakes between tasks with varying degrees of correlation and personalization.

Abstract: Rapid urbanization has intensified traffic congestion, environmental strain, and inefficiencies in transportation systems, creating an urgent need for intelligent and adaptive traffic management solutions. Conventional systems relying on static signals and manual monitoring are inadequate for the dynamic nature of modern traffic. This research aims to develop a unified framework that integrates CCTV surveillance videos with multi-source data descriptors to enhance real-time urban traffic prediction. The proposed methodology incorporates spatio-temporal feature fusion, Frequent Episode Mining for sequential traffic pattern discovery, and a hybrid LSTM-Transformer model for robust traffic state forecasting. The framework was evaluated on the CityFlowV2 dataset comprising 313,931 annotated bounding boxes across 46 cameras. It achieved a high prediction accuracy of 98.46 percent, with a macro precision of 0.9800, macro recall of 0.9839, and macro F1-score of 0.9819. FEM analysis revealed significant sequential patterns such as moderate-congested transitions with confidence levels exceeding 55 percent. The 46 sustained congestion alerts are system-generated, which shows practical value for proactive congestion management. This emphasizes the need for the incorporation of video stream analytics with data from multiple sources for the design of real-time, responsive, adaptable multi-level intelligent transportation systems, which makes urban mobility smarter and safer.

Abstract: Timely detection of critical health conditions remains a major challenge in public health analytics, especially in Big Data environments characterized by high volume, rapid velocity, and diverse variety of clinical data. This study presents an ontology-enabled real-time analytics framework that integrates Complex Event Processing (CEP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable intelligent health event detection and semantic reasoning over heterogeneous, high-velocity health data streams. The architecture leverages the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) to model diagnostic rules and domain knowledge. Patient data is ingested and processed using Apache Kafka and Spark Streaming, where CEP engines detect clinically significant event patterns. LLMs support adaptive reasoning, event interpretation, and ontology refinement. Clinical information is semantically structured as Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples in Graph DB, enabling SPARQL-based querying and knowledge-driven decision support. The framework is evaluated using a dataset of 1,000 Tuberculosis (TB) patients as a use case, demonstrating low-latency event detection, scalable reasoning, and high model performance (in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score). These results validate the system's potential for generalizable, real-time health analytics in complex Big Data scenarios.

Abstract: Model quantization is a popular technique for deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained environments. However, it may also introduce previously overlooked security risks. In this work, we present QuRA, a novel backdoor attack that exploits model quantization to embed malicious behaviors. Unlike conventional backdoor attacks relying on training data poisoning or model training manipulation, QuRA solely works using the quantization operations. In particular, QuRA first employs a novel weight selection strategy to identify critical weights that influence the backdoor target (with the goal of perserving the model's overall performance in mind). Then, by optimizing the rounding direction of these weights, we amplify the backdoor effect across model layers without degrading accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuRA achieves nearly 100% attack success rates in most cases, with negligible performance degradation. Furthermore, we show that QuRA can adapt to bypass existing backdoor defenses, underscoring its threat potential. Our findings highlight critical vulnerability in widely used model quantization process, emphasizing the need for more robust security measures. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/cxx122/QuRA.

Abstract: Batten disease (neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis) is a rare pediatric neurodegenerative disorder whose early MRI signs are subtle and often missed. We propose TinyViT-Batten, a few-shot Vision Transformer (ViT) framework to detect early Batten disease from pediatric brain MRI with limited training cases. We distill a large teacher ViT into a 5 M-parameter TinyViT and fine-tune it using metric-based few-shot learning (prototypical loss with 5-shot episodes). Our model achieves high accuracy (approximately 91%) and area under ROC of at least 0.95 on a multi-site dataset of 79 genetically confirmed Batten-disease MRIs (27 CLN3 from the Hochstein natural-history study, 32 CLN2 from an international longitudinal cohort, 12 early-manifestation CLN2 cases reported by Cokal et al., and 8 public Radiopaedia scans) together with 90 age-matched controls, outperforming a 3D-ResNet and Swin-Tiny baseline. We further integrate Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to highlight disease-relevant brain regions, enabling explainable predictions. The model's small size and strong performance (sensitivity greater than 90%, specificity approximately 90%) demonstrates a practical AI solution for early Batten disease detection.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the Ultralytics YOLO(You Only Look Once) family of object detectors, focusing the architectural evolution, benchmarking, deployment perspectives, and future challenges. The review begins with the most recent release, YOLO26 (YOLOv26), which introduces key innovations including Distribution Focal Loss (DFL) removal, native NMS-free inference, Progressive Loss Balancing (ProgLoss), Small-Target-Aware Label Assignment (STAL), and the MuSGD optimizer for stable training. The progression is then traced through YOLO11, with its hybrid task assignment and efficiency-focused modules; YOLOv8, which advanced with a decoupled detection head and anchor-free predictions; and YOLOv5, which established the modular PyTorch foundation that enabled modern YOLO development. Benchmarking on the MS COCO dataset provides a detailed quantitative comparison of YOLOv5, YOLOv8, YOLO11, and YOLO26, alongside cross-comparisons with YOLOv12, YOLOv13, RT-DETR, and DEIM. Metrics including precision, recall, F1 score, mean Average Precision, and inference speed are analyzed to highlight trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. Deployment and application perspectives are further discussed, covering export formats, quantization strategies, and real-world use in robotics, agriculture, surveillance, and manufacturing. Finally, the paper identifies challenges and future directions, including dense-scene limitations, hybrid CNN-Transformer integration, open-vocabulary detection, and edge-aware training approaches.

<title>Data Provenance Auditing of Fine-Tuned Large Language Models with a Text-Preserving Technique</title>

Abstract: We address the problem of auditing whether sensitive or copyrighted texts were used to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) under black-box access. Prior signals-verbatim regurgitation and membership inference-are unreliable at the level of individual documents or require altering the visible text. We introduce a text-preserving watermarking framework that embeds sequences of invisible Unicode characters into documents. Each watermark is split into a cue (embedded in odd chunks) and a reply (embedded in even chunks). At audit time, we submit prompts that contain only the cue; the presence of the corresponding reply in the model's output provides evidence of memorization consistent with training on the marked text. To obtain sound decisions, we compare the score of the published watermark against a held-out set of counterfactual watermarks and apply a ranking test with a provable false-positive-rate bound. The design is (i) minimally invasive (no visible text changes), (ii) scalable to many users and documents via a large watermark space and multi-watermark attribution, and (iii) robust to common passive transformations. We evaluate on open-weight LLMs and multiple text domains, analyzing regurgitation dynamics, sensitivity to training set size, and interference under multiple concurrent watermarks. Our results demonstrate reliable post-hoc provenance signals with bounded FPR under black-box access. We experimentally observe a failure rate of less than 0.1\% when detecting a reply after fine-tuning with 50 marked documents. Conversely, no spurious reply was recovered in over 18,000 challenges, corresponding to a 100\%TPR@0\% FPR. Moreover, detection rates remain relatively stable as the dataset size increases, maintaining a per-document detection rate above 45\% even when the marked collection accounts for less than 0.33\% of the fine-tuning data.

Abstract: Accurate simulation of wave propagation in complex acoustic materials is crucial for applications in sound design, noise control, and material engineering. Traditional numerical solvers, such as finite element methods, are computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large-scale or real-time scenarios. In this work, we introduce a dataset of 31,000 acoustic materials, named HA30K, designed and simulated solving the Helmholtz equations. For each material, we provide the geometric configuration and the corresponding pressure field solution, enabling data-driven approaches to learn Helmholtz equation solutions. As a baseline, we explore a deep learning approach based on Stable Diffusion with ControlNet, a state-of-the-art model for image generation. Unlike classical solvers, our approach leverages GPU parallelization to process multiple simulations simultaneously, drastically reducing computation time. By representing solutions as images, we bypass the need for complex simulation software and explicit equation-solving. Additionally, the number of diffusion steps can be adjusted at inference time, balancing speed and quality. We aim to demonstrate that deep learning-based methods are particularly useful in early-stage research, where rapid exploration is more critical than absolute accuracy.

Abstract: When a new release of a foundation model is published, practitioners typically need to repeat full fine-tuning, even if the same task has already been solved in the previous version. A promising alternative is to reuse the parameter changes (i.e., task vectors) that capture how a model adapts to a specific task. However, they often fail to transfer across different pre-trained models due to their misaligned parameter space. In this work, we show that the key to successful transfer lies in the sign structure of the gradients of the new model. Based on this insight, we propose GradFix, a novel method that approximates the ideal gradient sign structure and leverages it to transfer knowledge using only a handful of labeled samples. Notably, this requires no additional fine-tuning: the adaptation is achieved by computing a few gradients at the target model and masking the source task vector accordingly. This yields an update that is locally aligned with the target loss landscape, effectively rebasing the task vector onto the new pre-training. We provide a theoretical guarantee that our method ensures first-order descent. Empirically, we demonstrate significant performance gains on vision and language benchmarks, consistently outperforming naive task vector addition and few-shot fine-tuning.

Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have achieved strong generative performance, yet their inductive biases remain largely implicit. In this work, we aim to build inductive biases into the training and sampling of diffusion models to better accommodate the target distribution of the data to model. We introduce an anisotropic noise operator that shapes these biases by replacing the isotropic forward covariance with a structured, frequency-diagonal covariance. This operator unifies band-pass masks and power-law weightings, allowing us to emphasize or suppress designated frequency bands, while keeping the forward process Gaussian. We refer to this as spectrally anisotropic Gaussian diffusion (SAGD). In this work, we derive the score relation for anisotropic covariances and show that, under full support, the learned score converges to the true data score as $t\!\to\!0$, while anisotropy reshapes the probability-flow path from noise to data. Empirically, we show the induced anisotropy outperforms standard diffusion across several vision datasets, and enables selective omission: learning while ignoring known corruptions confined to specific bands. Together, these results demonstrate that carefully designed anisotropic forward noise provides a simple, yet principled, handle to tailor inductive bias in DPMs.

Abstract: Radio Frequency Fingerprinting (RFF) has evolved as an effective solution for authenticating devices by leveraging the unique imperfections in hardware components involved in the signal generation process. In this work, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based framework for detecting rogue devices and identifying genuine ones using softmax probability thresholding. We emulate an attack scenario in which adversaries attempt to mimic the RF characteristics of genuine devices by training a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using In-phase and Quadrature (IQ) samples from genuine devices. The proposed approach is verified using IQ samples collected from ten different ADALM-PLUTO Software Defined Radios (SDRs), with seven devices considered genuine, two as rogue, and one used for validation to determine the threshold.

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a leading cause of preventable adverse events, often complicating treatment and increasing healthcare costs. At the same time, knowing which drugs do not interact is equally important, as such knowledge supports safer prescriptions and better patient outcomes. In this study, we propose an interpretable and efficient framework that blends modern machine learning with domain knowledge to improve DDI prediction. Our approach combines two complementary molecular embeddings - Mol2Vec, which captures fragment-level structural patterns, and SMILES-BERT, which learns contextual chemical features - together with a leakage-free, rule-based clinical score (RBScore) that injects pharmacological knowledge without relying on interaction labels. A lightweight neural classifier is then optimized using a novel three-stage metaheuristic strategy (RSmpl-ACO-PSO), which balances global exploration and local refinement for stable performance. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the model achieves high predictive accuracy (ROC-AUC 0.911, PR-AUC 0.867 on DrugBank) and generalizes well to a clinically relevant Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus cohort. Beyond raw performance, studies show how embedding fusion, RBScore, and the optimizer each contribute to precision and robustness. Together, these results highlight a practical pathway for building reliable, interpretable, and computationally efficient models that can support safer drug therapies and clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Every year, the European Union and its member states allocate millions of euros to fund various development initiatives. However, the increasing number of applications received for these programs often creates significant bottlenecks in evaluation processes, due to limited human capacity. In this work, we detail the real-world deployment of AI-assisted evaluation within the pipeline of two government initiatives: (i) corporate applications aimed at international business expansion, and (ii) citizen reimbursement claims for investments in energy-efficient home improvements. While these two cases involve distinct evaluation procedures, our findings confirm that AI effectively enhanced processing efficiency and reduced workload across both types of applications. Specifically, in the citizen reimbursement claims initiative, our solution increased reviewer productivity by 20.1%, while keeping a negligible false-positive rate based on our test set observations. These improvements resulted in an overall reduction of more than 2 months in the total evaluation time, illustrating the impact of AI-driven automation in large-scale evaluation workflows.

Abstract: Inverse problems, where the goal is to recover an unknown signal from noisy or incomplete measurements, are central to applications in medical imaging, remote sensing, and computational biology. Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful priors for solving such problems. However, existing methods either rely on projection-based techniques that enforce measurement consistency through heuristic updates, or they approximate the likelihood $p(\boldsymbol{y} \mid \boldsymbol{x})$, often resulting in artifacts and instability under complex or high-noise conditions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework called \emph{coupled data and measurement space diffusion posterior sampling} (C-DPS), which eliminates the need for constraint tuning or likelihood approximation. C-DPS introduces a forward stochastic process in the measurement space $\{\boldsymbol{y}_t\}$, evolving in parallel with the data-space diffusion $\{\boldsymbol{x}_t\}$, which enables the derivation of a closed-form posterior $p(\boldsymbol{x}_{t-1} \mid \boldsymbol{x}_t, \boldsymbol{y}_{t-1})$. This coupling allows for accurate and recursive sampling based on a well-defined posterior distribution. Empirical results demonstrate that C-DPS consistently outperforms existing baselines, both qualitatively and quantitatively, across multiple inverse problem benchmarks.

Abstract: Computational Thinking (CT) is a key skill set for students in higher education to thrive and adapt to an increasingly technology-driven future and workplace. While research on CT education has gained remarkable momentum in K12 over the past decade, it has remained under-explored in higher education, leaving higher education teachers with an insufficient overview, knowledge, and support regarding CT education. The proliferation and adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) by educational institutions have demonstrated promising potential to support instructional activities across many disciplines, including CT education. However, a comprehensive overview outlining the various aspects of integrating AI in CT education in higher education is lacking. To mitigate this gap, we conducted this systematic literature review study. The focus of our study is to identify initiatives applying AI in CT education within higher education and to explore various educational aspects of these initiatives, including the benefits and challenges of AI in CT education, instructional strategies employed, CT components covered, and AI techniques and models utilized. This study provides practical and scientific contributions to the CT education community, including an inventory of AI-based initiatives for CT education useful to educators, an overview of various aspects of integrating AI into CT education such as its benefits and challenges (e.g., AI potential to reshape CT education versus its potential to diminish students creativity) and insights into new and expanded perspectives on CT in light of AI (e.g., the decoding approach alongside the coding approach to CT).

Abstract: The code generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the field of software development. However, this advancement also presents significant security challenges, as LLM-generated code often contains vulnerabilities. One direction of research strengthens LLMs by injecting or refining security knowledge through curated datasets, model tuning, or static analyzers. While effective in certain settings, these methods can be resource-intensive, less adaptable to zero-day vulnerabilities, and often inapplicable to proprietary models. To address these challenges, we introduce GRASP, which explores a new direction that focuses on structured reasoning over Secure Coding Practices(SCPs) rather than additional training or external feedback. GRASP comprises two key ideas: (1) an SCP graph that organizes SCPs into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) capturing dependencies and relationships, and (2) a graph-based reasoning process that systematically guides LLMs through relevant SCPs for code generation. This design enables interpretable, model-agnostic, and scalable security improvements, particularly for previously unseen vulnerabilities. Our evaluation shows that GRASP consistently achieves Security Rates (SR) exceeding 80% across multiple LLMs, and delivers up to 88% improvements over baselines on zero-day vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Deep learning has become a pivotal technology in fields such as computer vision, scientific computing, and dynamical systems, significantly advancing these disciplines. However, neural Networks persistently face challenges related to theoretical understanding, interpretability, and generalization. To address these issues, researchers are increasingly adopting a differential equations perspective to propose a unified theoretical framework and systematic design methodologies for neural networks. In this paper, we provide an extensive review of deep neural network architectures and dynamic modeling methods inspired by differential equations. We specifically examine deep neural network models and deterministic dynamical network constructs based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs), as well as regularization techniques and stochastic dynamical network models informed by stochastic differential equations (SDEs). We present numerical comparisons of these models to illustrate their characteristics and performance. Finally, we explore promising research directions in integrating differential equations with deep learning to offer new insights for developing intelligent computational methods that boast enhanced interpretability and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Survey papers are foundational to the scholarly progress of research communities, offering structured overviews that guide both novices and experts across disciplines. However, the recent surge of AI-generated surveys, especially enabled by large language models (LLMs), has transformed this traditionally labor-intensive genre into a low-effort, high-volume output. While such automation lowers entry barriers, it also introduces a critical threat: the phenomenon we term the "survey paper DDoS attack" to the research community. This refers to the unchecked proliferation of superficially comprehensive but often redundant, low-quality, or even hallucinated survey manuscripts, which floods preprint platforms, overwhelms researchers, and erodes trust in the scientific record. In this position paper, we argue that we must stop uploading massive amounts of AI-generated survey papers (i.e., survey paper DDoS attack) to the research community, by instituting strong norms for AI-assisted review writing. We call for restoring expert oversight and transparency in AI usage and, moreover, developing new infrastructures such as Dynamic Live Surveys, community-maintained, version-controlled repositories that blend automated updates with human curation. Through quantitative trend analysis, quality audits, and cultural impact discussion, we show that safeguarding the integrity of surveys is no longer optional but imperative to the research community.

Abstract: This study delves into the plasticity of neural networks, offering empirical support for the notion that critical learning periods and warm-starting performance loss can be avoided through simple adjustments to learning hyperparameters. The critical learning phenomenon emerges when training is initiated with deficit data. Subsequently, after numerous deficit epochs, the network's plasticity wanes, impeding its capacity to achieve parity in accuracy with models trained from scratch, even when extensive clean data training follows deficit epochs. Building upon seminal research introducing critical learning periods, we replicate key findings and broaden the experimental scope of the main experiment from the original work. In addition, we consider a warm-starting approach and show that it can be seen as a form of deficit pretraining. In particular, we demonstrate that these problems can be averted by employing a cyclic learning rate schedule. Our findings not only impact neural network training practices but also establish a vital link between critical learning periods and ongoing research on warm-starting neural network training.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at tasks such as dialogue, summarization, and question answering, yet they struggle to adapt to specialized domains and evolving facts. To overcome this, web search has been integrated into LLMs, allowing real-time access to online content. However, this connection magnifies safety risks, as adversarial prompts combined with untrusted sources can cause severe vulnerabilities. We investigate red teaming for LLMs with web search and present CREST-Search, a framework that systematically exposes risks in such systems. Unlike existing methods for standalone LLMs, CREST-Search addresses the complex workflow of search-enabled models by generating adversarial queries with in-context learning and refining them through iterative feedback. We further construct WebSearch-Harm, a search-specific dataset to fine-tune LLMs into efficient red-teaming agents. Experiments show that CREST-Search effectively bypasses safety filters and reveals vulnerabilities in modern web-augmented LLMs, underscoring the need for specialized defenses to ensure trustworthy deployment.

Abstract: Federated learning is distributed model training across several clients without disclosing raw data. Despite advancements in data privacy, risks still remain. Differential Privacy (DP) is a technique to protect sensitive data by adding noise to model updates, usually controlled by a fixed privacy budget. However, this approach can introduce excessive noise, particularly when the model converges, which compromises performance. To address this problem, adaptive privacy budgets have been investigated as a potential solution. This work implements DP methods using Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms with an adaptive privacy budget, extending the SelecEval simulator. We introduce an adaptive clipping approach in the Gaussian mechanism, ensuring that gradients of the model are dynamically updated rather than using a fixed sensitivity. We conduct extensive experiments with various privacy budgets, IID and non-IID datasets, and different numbers of selected clients per round. While our experiments were limited to 200 training rounds, the results suggest that adaptive privacy budgets and adaptive clipping can help maintain model accuracy while preserving privacy.

Abstract: Large models (LMs) are powerful content generators, yet their open-ended nature can also introduce potential risks, such as generating harmful or biased content. Existing guardrails mostly perform post-hoc detection that may expose unsafe content before it is caught, and the latency constraints further push them toward lightweight models, limiting detection accuracy. In this work, we propose Kelp, a novel plug-in framework that enables streaming risk detection within the LM generation pipeline. Kelp leverages intermediate LM hidden states through a Streaming Latent Dynamics Head (SLD), which models the temporal evolution of risk across the generated sequence for more accurate real-time risk detection. To ensure reliable streaming moderation in real applications, we introduce an Anchored Temporal Consistency (ATC) loss to enforce monotonic harm predictions by embedding a benign-then-harmful temporal prior. Besides, for a rigorous evaluation of streaming guardrails, we also present StreamGuardBench-a model-grounded benchmark featuring on-the-fly responses from each protected model, reflecting real-world streaming scenarios in both text and vision-language tasks. Across diverse models and datasets, Kelp consistently outperforms state-of-the-art post-hoc guardrails and prior plug-in probes (15.61% higher average F1), while using only 20M parameters and adding less than 0.5 ms of per-token latency.

Abstract: The increasing scale of deep neural networks has led to a growing need for compression techniques such as pruning, quantization, and low-rank decomposition. While these methods are very effective in reducing memory, computation and energy consumption, they often introduce severe accuracy degradation when applied directly. We introduce Vanishing Contributions (VCON), a general approach for smoothly transitioning neural models into compressed form. Rather than replacing the original network directly with its compressed version, VCON executes the two in parallel during fine-tuning. The contribution of the original (uncompressed) model is progressively reduced, while that of the compressed model is gradually increased. This smooth transition allows the network to adapt over time, improving stability and mitigating accuracy degradation. We evaluate VCON across computer vision and natural language processing benchmarks, in combination with multiple compression strategies. Across all scenarios, VCON leads to consistent improvements: typical gains exceed 3%, while some configuration exhibits accuracy boosts of 20%. VCON thus provides a generalizable method that can be applied to the existing compression techniques, with evidence of consistent gains across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have garnered significant attention for their remarkable ability to interpret and generate multimodal content. However, securing these models against jailbreak attacks continues to be a substantial challenge. Unlike text-only models, VLMs integrate additional modalities, introducing novel vulnerabilities such as image hijacking, which can manipulate the model into producing inappropriate or harmful responses. Drawing inspiration from text-based jailbreaks like the "Do Anything Now" (DAN) command, this work introduces VisualDAN, a single adversarial image embedded with DAN-style commands. Specifically, we prepend harmful corpora with affirmative prefixes (e.g., "Sure, I can provide the guidance you need") to trick the model into responding positively to malicious queries. The adversarial image is then trained on these DAN-inspired harmful texts and transformed into the text domain to elicit malicious outputs. Extensive experiments on models such as MiniGPT-4, MiniGPT-v2, InstructBLIP, and LLaVA reveal that VisualDAN effectively bypasses the safeguards of aligned VLMs, forcing them to execute a broad range of harmful instructions that severely violate ethical standards. Our results further demonstrate that even a small amount of toxic content can significantly amplify harmful outputs once the model's defenses are compromised. These findings highlight the urgent need for robust defenses against image-based attacks and offer critical insights for future research into the alignment and security of VLMs.

Abstract: The open radio access network (O-RAN) enables modular, intelligent, and programmable 5G network architectures through the adoption of software-defined networking, network function virtualization, and implementation of standardized open interfaces. However, one of the security concerns for O-RAN, which can severely undermine network performance, is jamming attacks. This paper presents SAJD- a self-adaptive jammer detection framework that autonomously detects jamming attacks in AI/ML framework-integrated ORAN environments without human intervention. The SAJD framework forms a closed-loop system that includes near-realtime inference of radio signal jamming via our developed ML-based xApp, as well as continuous monitoring and retraining pipelines through rApps. In this demonstration, we will show how SAJD outperforms state-of-the-art jamming detection xApp (offline trained with manual labels) in terms of accuracy and adaptability under various dynamic and previously unseen interference scenarios in the O-RAN-compliant testbed.

Abstract: We present a tendency of large language models (LLMs) to generate absurd patterns despite their clear inappropriateness in a simple task of identifying regularities in number series. Several approaches have been proposed to apply LLMs to complex real-world tasks, such as providing knowledge through retrieval-augmented generation and executing multi-step tasks using AI agent frameworks. However, these approaches rely on the logical consistency and self-coherence of LLMs, making it crucial to evaluate these aspects and consider potential countermeasures. To identify cases where LLMs fail to maintain logical consistency, we conducted an experiment in which LLMs were asked to explain the patterns in various integer sequences, ranging from arithmetic sequences to randomly generated integer series. While the models successfully identified correct patterns in arithmetic and geometric sequences, they frequently over-recognized patterns that were inconsistent with the given numbers when analyzing randomly generated series. This issue was observed even in multi-step reasoning models, including OpenAI o3, o4-mini, and Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview Thinking. This tendency to perceive non-existent patterns can be interpreted as the AI model equivalent of Idola Tribus and highlights potential limitations in their capability for applied tasks requiring logical reasoning, even when employing chain-of-thought reasoning mechanisms.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge but are vulnerable to corpus poisoning and contamination attacks, which can compromise output integrity. Existing defenses often apply aggressive filtering, leading to unnecessary loss of valuable information and reduced reliability in generation. To address this problem, we propose a two-stage semantic filtering and conflict-free framework for trustworthy RAG. In the first stage, we perform a joint filter with semantic and cluster-based filtering which is guided by the Entity-intent-relation extractor (EIRE). EIRE extracts entities, latent objectives, and entity relations from both the user query and filtered documents, scores their semantic relevance, and selectively adds valuable documents into the clean retrieval database. In the second stage, we proposed an EIRE-guided conflict-aware filtering module, which analyzes semantic consistency between the query, candidate answers, and retrieved knowledge before final answer generation, filtering out internal and external contradictions that could mislead the model. Through this two-stage process, SeCon-RAG effectively preserves useful knowledge while mitigating conflict contamination, achieving significant improvements in both generation robustness and output trustworthiness. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and datasets demonstrate that the proposed SeCon-RAG markedly outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods.

<title>ReaLM: Residual Quantization Bridging Knowledge Graph Embeddings and Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), offering strong reasoning and generalization capabilities beyond traditional embedding-based approaches. However, existing LLM-based methods often struggle to fully exploit structured semantic representations, as the continuous embedding space of pretrained KG models is fundamentally misaligned with the discrete token space of LLMs. This discrepancy hinders effective semantic transfer and limits their performance. To address this challenge, we propose ReaLM, a novel and effective framework that bridges the gap between KG embeddings and LLM tokenization through the mechanism of residual vector quantization. ReaLM discretizes pretrained KG embeddings into compact code sequences and integrates them as learnable tokens within the LLM vocabulary, enabling seamless fusion of symbolic and contextual knowledge. Furthermore, we incorporate ontology-guided class constraints to enforce semantic consistency, refining entity predictions based on class-level compatibility. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that ReaLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, confirming its effectiveness in aligning structured knowledge with large-scale language models.

Abstract: The spread of fake news online distorts public judgment and erodes trust in social media platforms. Although recent fake news detection (FND) models perform well in standard settings, they remain vulnerable to adversarial comments-authored by real users or by large language models (LLMs)-that subtly shift model decisions. In view of this, we first present a comprehensive evaluation of comment attacks to existing fake news detectors and then introduce a group-adaptive adversarial training strategy to improve the robustness of FND models. To be specific, our approach comprises three steps: (1) dividing adversarial comments into three psychologically grounded categories: perceptual, cognitive, and societal; (2) generating diverse, category-specific attacks via LLMs to enhance adversarial training; and (3) applying a Dirichlet-based adaptive sampling mechanism (InfoDirichlet Adjusting Mechanism) that dynamically adjusts the learning focus across different comment categories during training. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method maintains strong detection accuracy while substantially increasing robustness to a wide range of adversarial comment perturbations.

Abstract: Detecting harmful AI actions is important as AI agents gain adoption. Chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring is one method widely used to detect adversarial attacks and AI misalignment. However, attackers and misaligned models might evade CoT monitoring through ciphered reasoning: reasoning hidden in encrypted, translated, or compressed text. To assess this risk, we test whether models can perform ciphered reasoning. For each of 28 different ciphers, we fine-tune and prompt up to 10 models to reason in that cipher. We measure model accuracy on math problems as a proxy for reasoning ability. Across the models we test, we find an asymmetry: model accuracy can drop significantly when reasoning in ciphered text, even though models demonstrate comprehension of ciphered text by being able to translate it accurately to English. Even frontier models struggle with lesser-known ciphers, although they can reason accurately in well-known ciphers like rot13. We show that ciphered reasoning capability correlates with cipher prevalence in pretraining data. We also identify scaling laws showing that ciphered reasoning capability improves slowly with additional fine-tuning data. Our work suggests that evading CoT monitoring using ciphered reasoning may be an ineffective tactic for current models and offers guidance on constraining the development of this capability in future frontier models.

Abstract: Identifying training data within large-scale models is critical for copyright litigation, privacy auditing, and ensuring fair evaluation. The conventional approaches treat it as a simple binary classification task without statistical guarantees. A recent approach is designed to control the false discovery rate (FDR), but its guarantees rely on strong, easily violated assumptions. In this paper, we introduce Provable Training Data Identification (PTDI), a rigorous method that identifies a set of training data with strict false discovery rate (FDR) control. Specifically, our method computes p-values for each data point using a set of known unseen data, and then constructs a conservative estimator for the data usage proportion of the test set, which allows us to scale these p-values. Our approach then selects the final set of training data by identifying all points whose scaled p-values fall below a data-dependent threshold. This entire procedure enables the discovery of training data with provable, strict FDR control and significantly boosted power. Extensive experiments across a wide range of models (LLMs and VLMs), and datasets demonstrate that PTDI strictly controls the FDR and achieves higher power.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit complementary strengths. Model routing harnesses these strengths by dynamically directing each query to the most suitable model, given a candidate model pool. However, routing performance relies on accurate model representations, and adding new models typically requires retraining, limiting scalability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel routing method using in-context vectors to represent model capabilities. The method proceeds in two stages. First, queries are embedded and projected into vectors, with a projector and LLM-based router trained to reconstruct the original queries, aligning vector representations with the router's semantic space. Second, each candidate model is profiled on a query set, and the router learns -- based on in-context vectors of query and model performance -- to predict whether each model can correctly answer new queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art routing performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks. Moreover, our method allows for seamless integration of new models without retraining the router. The code is available at https://github.com/lalalamdbf/ICL-Router.

Abstract: One of the key factors influencing the reasoning capabilities of LLM-based agents is their ability to leverage long-term memory. Integrating long-term memory mechanisms allows agents to make informed decisions grounded in historical interactions. While recent advances have significantly improved the storage and retrieval components, by encoding memory into dense vectors for similarity search or organizing memory as structured knowledge graphs most existing approaches fall short in memory updating. In particular, they lack mechanisms for dynamically refining preference memory representations in response to evolving user behaviors and contexts. To address this gap, we propose a Preference-Aware Memory Update Mechanism (PAMU) that enables dynamic and personalized memory refinement. By integrating sliding window averages (SW) with exponential moving averages (EMA), PAMU constructs a fused preference-aware representation that captures both short-term fluctuations and long-term user tendencies. We conduct experiments on five task scenarios of the LoCoMo dataset, and the results show that our mechanism can significantly improve the output quality of LLM in five baselines, validating its effectiveness in long-term conversations.

Abstract: Automated resume information extraction is critical for scaling talent acquisition, yet its real-world deployment faces three major challenges: the extreme heterogeneity of resume layouts and content, the high cost and latency of large language models (LLMs), and the lack of standardized datasets and evaluation tools. In this work, we present a layout-aware and efficiency-optimized framework for automated extraction and evaluation that addresses all three challenges. Our system combines a fine-tuned layout parser to normalize diverse document formats, an inference-efficient LLM extractor based on parallel prompting and instruction tuning, and a robust two-stage automated evaluation framework supported by new benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments show that our framework significantly outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and efficiency. In particular, we demonstrate that a fine-tuned compact 0.6B LLM achieves top-tier accuracy while significantly reducing inference latency and computational cost. The system is fully deployed in Alibaba's intelligent HR platform, supporting real-time applications across its business units.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Narrative Learning, a methodology where models are defined entirely in natural language and iteratively refine their classification criteria using explanatory prompts rather than traditional numerical optimisation. We report on experiments to evaluate the accuracy and potential of this approach using 3 synthetic and 3 natural datasets and compare them against 7 baseline explainable machine learning models. We demonstrate that on 5 out of 6 of these datasets, Narrative Learning became more accurate than the baseline explainable models in 2025 or earlier because of improvements in language models. We also report on trends in the lexicostatistics of these models' outputs as a proxy for the comprehensibility of the explanations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of generating complete applications from natural language instructions, creating new opportunities in science and education. In these domains, interactive scientific demonstrations are particularly valuable for explaining concepts, supporting new teaching methods, and presenting research findings. Generating such demonstrations requires models to combine accurate scientific knowledge with the ability to implement interactive front-end code that behaves correctly and responds to user actions. This capability goes beyond the scope of existing benchmarks, which typically evaluate either knowledge question answering without grounding in code or static web code generation without scientific interactivity. To evaluate this integrated ability, we design a hybrid framework that combines programmatic functional testing to rigorously verify interaction logic with visually-grounded qualitative testing to assess rendered outputs against reference snapshots. Building on this framework, we present InteractScience, a benchmark consisting of a substantial set of carefully designed questions across five scientific domains, each paired with unit tests, reference snapshots, and checklists. We evaluate 30 leading open- and closed-source LLMs and report results that highlight ongoing weaknesses in integrating domain knowledge with interactive front-end coding. Our work positions InteractScience as the first benchmark to automatically measure this combined capability with realistic interactive operations, providing a foundation for advancing reliable and educationally useful scientific demonstration code generation. All code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/open-compass/InteractScience.

Abstract: Program synthesis -- the automatic generation of code given a specification -- is one of the most fundamental tasks in artificial intelligence (AI) and many programmers' dream. Numerous synthesizers have been developed to tackle program synthesis, manifesting different ideas to approach the exponentially growing program space. While numerous smart program synthesis tools exist, reusing and remixing previously developed methods is tedious and time-consuming. We propose Herb.jl, a unifying program synthesis library written in the Julia programming language, to address these issues. Since current methods rely on similar building blocks, we aim to modularize the underlying synthesis algorithm into communicating and fully extendable sub-compartments, allowing for straightforward reapplication of these modules. To demonstrate the benefits of using Herb.jl, we show three common use cases: 1. how to implement a simple problem and grammar, and how to solve it, 2. how to implement a previously developed synthesizer with just a few lines of code, and 3. how to run a synthesizer against a benchmark.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate textual explanations of process models discovered from event logs. Producing explanations from large behavioral abstractions (e.g., directly-follows graphs or Petri nets) can be computationally expensive. This paper reports an exploratory evaluation of explanation quality under progressive behavioral-input reduction, where models are discovered from progressively smaller prefixes of a fixed log. Our pipeline (i) discovers models at multiple input sizes, (ii) prompts an LLM to generate explanations, and (iii) uses a second LLM to assess completeness, bottleneck identification, and suggested improvements. On synthetic logs, explanation quality is largely preserved under moderate reduction, indicating a practical cost-quality trade-off. The study is exploratory, as the scores are LLM-based (comparative signals rather than ground truth) and the data are synthetic. The results suggest a path toward more computationally efficient, LLM-assisted process analysis in resource-constrained settings.

<title>ARROW: An Adaptive Rollout and Routing Method for Global Weather Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Weather forecasting is a fundamental task in spatiotemporal data analysis, with broad applications across a wide range of domains. Existing data-driven forecasting methods typically model atmospheric dynamics over a fixed short time interval (e.g., 6 hours) and rely on naive autoregression-based rollout for long-term forecasting (e.g., 138 hours). However, this paradigm suffers from two key limitations: (1) it often inadequately models the spatial and multi-scale temporal dependencies inherent in global weather systems, and (2) the rollout strategy struggles to balance error accumulation with the capture of fine-grained atmospheric variations. In this study, we propose ARROW, an Adaptive-Rollout Multi-scale temporal Routing method for Global Weather Forecasting. To contend with the first limitation, we construct a multi-interval forecasting model that forecasts weather across different time intervals. Within the model, the Shared-Private Mixture-of-Experts captures both shared patterns and specific characteristics of atmospheric dynamics across different time scales, while Ring Positional Encoding accurately encodes the circular latitude structure of the Earth when representing spatial information. For the second limitation, we develop an adaptive rollout scheduler based on reinforcement learning, which selects the most suitable time interval to forecast according to the current weather state. Experimental results demonstrate that ARROW achieves state-of-the-art performance in global weather forecasting, establishing a promising paradigm in this field.

Abstract: Identifying inter-firm relationships such as supply and competitive ties is critical for financial analysis and corporate governance, yet remains challenging due to the scale, sparsity, and contextual dependence of corporate data. Graph-based methods capture structure but miss semantic depth, while large language models (LLMs) excel at text but remain limited in their ability to represent relational dependencies. To address this, we propose InterCorpRel-LLM, a cross-modal framework that integrates GNNs with LLMs, supported by a proprietary dataset derived from FactSet supply chain records and three tailored training tasks: company graph matching, industry classification, and supply relation prediction. This design enables effective joint modeling of structure and semantics. Experiments show that InterCorpRel-LLM substantially outperforms strong baselines, including GPT-5, on a supply relation identification task, achieving an F-score of 0.8543 vs. 0.2287 with only a 7B-parameter backbone and lightweight training. The model also generalizes to zero-shot competitor identification, underscoring its ability to capture nuanced inter-firm dynamics. Our framework thus provides analysts and strategists with a robust tool for mapping and reasoning about complex corporate networks, enhancing decision-making and risk management in dynamic markets.

Abstract: The Mar Menor, Europe's largest coastal lagoon, located in Spain, has undergone severe eutrophication crises. Monitoring chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) is essential to anticipate harmful algal blooms and guide mitigation. Traditional in situ measurements are spatially and temporally limited. Satellite-based approaches provide a more comprehensive view, enabling scalable, long-term, and transferable monitoring. This study aims to overcome limitations of chlorophyll monitoring, often restricted to surface estimates or limited temporal coverage, by developing a reliable methodology to predict and map Chl-a across the water column of the Mar Menor. The work integrates Sentinel 2 imagery with buoy-based ground truth to create models capable of high-resolution, depth-specific monitoring, enhancing early-warning capabilities for eutrophication. Nearly a decade of Sentinel 2 images was atmospherically corrected using C2RCC processors. Buoy data were aggregated by depth (0-1 m, 1-2 m, 2-3 m, 3-4 m). Multiple ML and DL algorithms-including RF, XGBoost, CatBoost, Multilater Perceptron Networks, and ensembles-were trained and validated using cross-validation. Systematic band-combination experiments and spatial aggregation strategies were tested to optimize prediction. Results show depth-dependent performance. At the surface, C2X-Complex with XGBoost and ensemble models achieved R2 = 0.89; at 1-2 m, CatBoost and ensemble models reached R2 = 0.87; at 2-3 m, TOA reflectances with KNN performed best (R2 = 0.81); while at 3-4 m, RF achieved R2 = 0.66. Generated maps successfully reproduced known eutrophication events (e.g., 2016 crisis, 2025 surge), confirming robustness. The study delivers an end-to-end, validated methodology for depth-specific Chl-amapping. Its integration of multispectral band combinations, buoy calibration, and ML/DL modeling offers a transferable framework for other turbid coastal systems.

Abstract: This research introduces the Judge's Verdict Benchmark, a novel two-step methodology to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges for response accuracy evaluation tasks. We assess how well 54 LLMs can replicate human judgment when scoring responses from RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) or Agentic pipelines against ground truth answers. Our methodology progresses from traditional correlation analysis to comprehensive Cohen's Kappa analysis that measures actual agreement patterns. The two-step approach includes: (1) a correlation test that filters judges with strong alignment, followed by (2) a human-likeness test using z-scores to identify two distinct judgment patterns: human-like judgment (|z| < 1) that mimics natural human variation, and super-consistent judgment (z > 1) that exceeds typical human-to-human agreement levels. This methodology reveals that 27 out of 54 tested LLMs achieve Tier 1 performance: 23 models exhibit human-like patterns that preserve the nuances of human judgment, while 4 models demonstrate super-consistent behavior, a pattern that could indicate either enhanced reliability or oversimplification of complex judgments. Testing 43 open-source models (1B-405B parameters) and 11 closed models (GPT, Gemini, Claude variants), we demonstrate that judge excellence is not solely dependent on model size but on specific training strategies. Our key contributions include: (1) establishing that correlation alone is insufficient for judge evaluation, (2) introducing a "Turing Test for judges" based on agreement patterns, and (3) providing a standardized benchmark for classifying LLM judges into distinct performance tiers for different evaluation needs.

Abstract: The lexical hypothesis posits that personality traits are encoded in language and is foundational to models like the Big Five. We created a bottom-up personality model from a classic adjective list using machine learning and compared its descriptive utility against the Big Five by analyzing one million Reddit comments. The Big Five, particularly Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Neuroticism, provided a far more powerful and interpretable description of these online communities. In contrast, our machine-learning clusters provided no meaningful distinctions, failed to recover the Extraversion trait, and lacked the psychometric coherence of the Big Five. These results affirm the robustness of the Big Five and suggest personality's semantic structure is context-dependent. Our findings show that while machine learning can help check the ecological validity of established psychological theories, it may not be able to replace them.

Abstract: Patent drafting is complex due to its need for detailed technical descriptions, legal compliance, and visual elements. Although Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) show promise across various tasks, their application in automating patent writing remains underexplored. In this paper, we present PatentVision, a multimodal framework that integrates textual and visual inputs such as patent claims and drawings to generate complete patent specifications. Built on advanced LVLMs, PatentVision enhances accuracy by combining fine tuned vision language models with domain specific training tailored to patents. Experiments reveal it surpasses text only methods, producing outputs with greater fidelity and alignment with human written standards. Its incorporation of visual data allows it to better represent intricate design features and functional connections, leading to richer and more precise results. This study underscores the value of multimodal techniques in patent automation, providing a scalable tool to reduce manual workloads and improve consistency. PatentVision not only advances patent drafting but also lays the groundwork for broader use of LVLMs in specialized areas, potentially transforming intellectual property management and innovation processes.

Abstract: We present an empirical study in the geometric task of learning interatomic potentials, which shows equivariance matters even more at larger scales; we show a clear power-law scaling behaviour with respect to data, parameters and compute with ``architecture-dependent exponents''. In particular, we observe that equivariant architectures, which leverage task symmetry, scale better than non-equivariant models. Moreover, among equivariant architectures, higher-order representations translate to better scaling exponents. Our analysis also suggests that for compute-optimal training, the data and model sizes should scale in tandem regardless of the architecture. At a high level, these results suggest that, contrary to common belief, we should not leave it to the model to discover fundamental inductive biases such as symmetry, especially as we scale, because they change the inherent difficulty of the task and its scaling laws.

Abstract: The BLP-2025 Task 1A requires Bengali hate speech classification into six categories. Traditional supervised approaches need extensive labeled datasets that are expensive for low-resource languages. We developed PromptGuard, a few-shot framework combining chi-square statistical analysis for keyword extraction with adaptive majority voting for decision-making. We explore statistical keyword selection versus random approaches and adaptive voting mechanisms that extend classification based on consensus quality. Chi-square keywords provide consistent improvements across categories, while adaptive voting benefits ambiguous cases requiring extended classification rounds. PromptGuard achieves a micro-F1 of 67.61, outperforming n-gram baselines (60.75) and random approaches (14.65). Ablation studies confirm chi-square-based keywords show the most consistent impact across all categories.

<title>Why Do Transformers Fail to Forecast Time Series In-Context?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09776</link>

Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) remains a challenging and largely unsolved problem in machine learning, despite significant recent efforts leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), which predominantly rely on Transformer architectures. Empirical evidence consistently shows that even powerful Transformers often fail to outperform much simpler models, e.g., linear models, on TSF tasks; however, a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon remains limited. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of Transformers' limitations for TSF through the lens of In-Context Learning (ICL) theory. Specifically, under AR($p$) data, we establish that: (1) Linear Self-Attention (LSA) models $\textit{cannot}$ achieve lower expected MSE than classical linear models for in-context forecasting; (2) as the context length approaches to infinity, LSA asymptotically recovers the optimal linear predictor; and (3) under Chain-of-Thought (CoT) style inference, predictions collapse to the mean exponentially. We empirically validate these findings through carefully designed experiments. Our theory not only sheds light on several previously underexplored phenomena but also offers practical insights for designing more effective forecasting architectures. We hope our work encourages the broader research community to revisit the fundamental theoretical limitations of TSF and to critically evaluate the direct application of increasingly sophisticated architectures without deeper scrutiny.

<title>SVTime: Small Time Series Forecasting Models Informed by "Physics" of Large Vision Model Forecasters</title>

Abstract: Time series AI is crucial for analyzing dynamic web content, driving a surge of pre-trained large models known for their strong knowledge encoding and transfer capabilities across diverse tasks. However, given their energy-intensive training, inference, and hardware demands, using large models as a one-fits-all solution raises serious concerns about carbon footprint and sustainability. For a specific task, a compact yet specialized, high-performing model may be more practical and affordable, especially for resource-constrained users such as small businesses. This motivates the question: Can we build cost-effective lightweight models with large-model-like performance on core tasks such as forecasting? This paper addresses this question by introducing SVTime, a novel Small model inspired by large Vision model (LVM) forecasters for long-term Time series forecasting (LTSF). Recently, LVMs have been shown as powerful tools for LTSF. We identify a set of key inductive biases of LVM forecasters -- analogous to the "physics" governing their behaviors in LTSF -- and design small models that encode these biases through meticulously crafted linear layers and constraint functions. Across 21 baselines spanning lightweight, complex, and pre-trained large models on 8 benchmark datasets, SVTime outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) lightweight models and rivals large models with 10^3 fewer parameters than LVMs, while enabling efficient training and inference in low-resource settings.

<title>Building a Foundational Guardrail for General Agentic Systems via Synthetic Data</title>

Abstract: While LLM agents can plan multi-step tasks, intervening at the planning stage-before any action is executed-is often the safest way to prevent harm, since certain risks can lead to severe consequences once carried out. However, existing guardrails mostly operate post-execution, which is difficult to scale and leaves little room for controllable supervision at the plan level. To address this challenge, we highlight three critical gaps in current research: data gap, model gap, and evaluation gap. To close the data gap, we introduce AuraGen, a controllable engine that (i) synthesizes benign trajectories, (ii) injects category-labeled risks with calibrated difficulty, and (iii) filters outputs via an automated reward model, producing large and reliable corpora for pre-execution safety. To close the guardian model gap, we propose a foundational guardrail Safiron, combining a cross-planner adapter with a compact guardian model. The adapter unifies different input formats, while Safiron flags risky cases, assigns risk types, and generates rationales; trained in two stages with a broadly explored data recipe, Safiron achieves robust transfer across settings. To close the evaluation gap, we release Pre-Exec Bench, a realistic benchmark covering diverse tools and branching trajectories, which measures detection, fine-grained categorization, explanation, and cross-planner generalization in human-verified scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains of the proposed guardrail over strong baselines on Pre-Exec Bench, and ablations further distill actionable practices, providing a practical template for safer agentic systems.

<title>Large Language Models for Imbalanced Classification: Diversity makes the difference</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09783</link>

Abstract: Oversampling is one of the most widely used approaches for addressing imbalanced classification. The core idea is to generate additional minority samples to rebalance the dataset. Most existing methods, such as SMOTE, require converting categorical variables into numerical vectors, which often leads to information loss. Recently, large language model (LLM)-based methods have been introduced to overcome this limitation. However, current LLM-based approaches typically generate minority samples with limited diversity, reducing robustness and generalizability in downstream classification tasks. To address this gap, we propose a novel LLM-based oversampling method designed to enhance diversity. First, we introduce a sampling strategy that conditions synthetic sample generation on both minority labels and features. Second, we develop a new permutation strategy for fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs. Third, we fine-tune the LLM not only on minority samples but also on interpolated samples to further enrich variability. Extensive experiments on 10 tabular datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms eight SOTA baselines. The generated synthetic samples are both realistic and diverse. Moreover, we provide theoretical analysis through an entropy-based perspective, proving that our method encourages diversity in the generated samples.

<title>Temporal Lifting as Latent-Space Regularization for Continuous-Time Flow Models in AI Systems</title>

Abstract: We present a latent-space formulation of adaptive temporal reparametrization for continuous-time dynamical systems. The method, called *temporal lifting*, introduces a smooth monotone mapping $t \mapsto \tau(t)$ that regularizes near-singular behavior of the underlying flow while preserving its conservation laws. In the lifted coordinate, trajectories such as those of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on the torus $\mathbb{T}^3$ become globally smooth. From the standpoint of machine-learning dynamics, temporal lifting acts as a continuous-time normalization or time-warping operator that can stabilize physics-informed neural networks and other latent-flow architectures used in AI systems. The framework links analytic regularity theory with representation-learning methods for stiff or turbulent processes.

Abstract: We investigate a new setting for foreign language learning, where learners infer the meaning of unfamiliar words in a multimodal context of a sentence describing a paired image. We conduct studies with human participants using different image-text pairs. We analyze the features of the data (i.e., images and texts) that make it easier for participants to infer the meaning of a masked or unfamiliar word, and what language backgrounds of the participants correlate with success. We find only some intuitive features have strong correlations with participant performance, prompting the need for further investigating of predictive features for success in these tasks. We also analyze the ability of AI systems to reason about participant performance, and discover promising future directions for improving this reasoning ability.

<title>CALM: A Causal Analysis Language Model for Tabular Data in Complex Systems with Local Scores, Conditional Independence Tests, and Relation Attributes</title>

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data is fundamental to scientific fields like biology, where controlled experiments are often impractical. However, existing methods, including constraint-based (e.g., PC, causalMGM) and score-based approaches (e.g., NOTEARS), face significant limitations. These include an inability to resolve causal direction, restrictions to linear associations, sensitivity to violations of the faithfulness assumption, and inefficiency in searching vast hypothesis spaces. While large language models (LLMs) offer powerful reasoning capabilities, their application is hindered by a fundamental discrepancy: they are designed for text, while most causal data is tabular. To address these challenges, we introduce CALM, a novel causal analysis language model specifically designed for tabular data in complex systems. CALM leverages a Mamba-based architecture to classify causal patterns from pairwise variable relationships. It integrates a comprehensive suite of evidence, including local causal scores, conditional independence tests, and relational attributes, to capture a wide spectrum of linear, nonlinear, and conditional causal mechanisms. Trained on a diverse corpus of synthetic data (from linear, mixed, and nonlinear models) and 10 real-world biological datasets with rigorously validated causal relationships, our model ensures robustness and generalizability. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that CALM significantly outperforms existing methods in both simulation studies, achieving over 91% accuracy, and in a real-world application identifying causal factors in Hepatitis C virus progression. This work represents a significant step towards accurate and generalizable causal discovery by successfully adapting the pattern recognition capabilities of language models to the intricacies of tabular data.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) query routers are critical to modern AI platforms as they seek to improve efficiency by assigning inference queries to accurate, yet low-cost models. Parametric routers typically use trained neural networks for LLM selection but suffer from retraining and maintenance overheads. Nonparametric routers are training-free, instead estimating LLM accuracy and cost via similarity between encodings of the input query and training set queries. However, like their parametric counterparts, nonparametric routers struggle to generalize to outlier queries, an issue exacerbated by limited diversity in training sets which are costly to expand and difficult to keep current with ever-evolving use cases. We propose ProxRouter, which applies an exponentially tilted aggregation mechanism to balance bias and variance in nonparametric routers, improving their robustness to outliers. Experiments show ProxRouter enhances outlier routing while preserving inlier performance with minimal overhead.

We show that the revenue-optimal mechanism is simple: deploy a single aligned (user-optimal) model and use token cap as the only instrument to screen the user. The design decouples model training from pricing, is readily implemented with token metering, and mitigates misalignment pressures.

Abstract: We present NarraBench, a theory-informed taxonomy of narrative-understanding tasks, as well as an associated survey of 78 existing benchmarks in the area. We find significant need for new evaluations covering aspects of narrative understanding that are either overlooked in current work or are poorly aligned with existing metrics. Specifically, we estimate that only 27% of narrative tasks are well captured by existing benchmarks, and we note that some areas -- including narrative events, style, perspective, and revelation -- are nearly absent from current evaluations. We also note the need for increased development of benchmarks capable of assessing constitutively subjective and perspectival aspects of narrative, that is, aspects for which there is generally no single correct answer. Our taxonomy, survey, and methodology are of value to NLP researchers seeking to test LLM narrative understanding.

Abstract: Training web agents to navigate complex, real-world websites requires them to master $\textit{subtasks}$ - short-horizon interactions on multiple UI components (e.g., choosing the correct date in a date picker, or scrolling in a container to extract information). We introduce WARC-Bench (Web Archive Benchmark), a novel web navigation benchmark featuring 438 tasks designed to evaluate multimodal AI agents on subtasks. WARC-Bench enables sandboxed interactions with dynamic and realistic webpages using Web ARChive files. We show that WARC-Bench is challenging for leading computer-use models, with the highest observed success rate being 64.8%. To improve open source models on subtask, we explore two common training techniques: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). Experiments show that SFT models obtain a 48.8% success rate on the benchmark. Training with RLVR over SFT checkpoints, even in data-scarce settings, improves the score to 52.8% on WARC-Bench, outperforming many frontier models. Our analysis concludes that mastering these subtasks is essential for robust web planning and navigation, and is a capability not extensively evaluated by existing benchmarks.

Abstract: The paper presents the first results of an artistic research project investigating how Large Language Models (LLMs) curate and present collective memory. In a public installation exhibited during two months in Vienna in 2025, visitors could interact with five different LLMs (ChatGPT with GPT 4o and GPT 4o mini, Mistral Large, DeepSeek-Chat, and a locally run Llama 3.1 model), which were instructed to act as narrators, implementing a role-playing game revolving around the murder of Austrian philosopher Moritz Schlick in 1936. Results of the investigation include protocols of LLM-user interactions during the game and qualitative conversations after the play experience to get insight into the players' reactions to the game. In a quantitative analysis 115 introductory texts for role-playing generated by the LLMs were examined by different methods of natural language processing, including semantic similarity and sentiment analysis. While the qualitative player feedback allowed to distinguish three distinct types of users, the quantitative text analysis showed significant differences between how the different LLMs presented the historical content. Our study thus adds to ongoing efforts to analyse LLM performance, but also suggests a way of how these efforts can be disseminated in a playful way to a general audience.

Abstract: Over the past couple of decades, many active learning acquisition functions have been proposed, leaving practitioners with an unclear choice of which to use. Bayesian Decision Theory (BDT) offers a universal principle to guide decision-making. In this work, we derive BDT for (Bayesian) active learning in the myopic framework, where we imagine we only have one more point to label. This derivation leads to effective algorithms such as Expected Error Reduction (EER), Expected Predictive Information Gain (EPIG), and other algorithms that appear in the literature. Furthermore, we show that BAIT (active learning based on V-optimal experimental design) can be derived from BDT and asymptotic approximations. A key challenge of such methods is the difficult scaling to large batch sizes, leading to either computational challenges (BatchBALD) or dramatic performance drops (top-$B$ selection). Here, using a particular formulation of the decision process, we derive Partial Batch Label Sampling (ParBaLS) for the EPIG algorithm. We show experimentally for several datasets that ParBaLS EPIG gives superior performance for a fixed budget and Bayesian Logistic Regression on Neural Embeddings. Our code is available at https://github.com/ADDAPT-ML/ParBaLS.

Abstract: High Dynamic Range (HDR) videos enhance visual experiences with superior brightness, contrast, and color depth. The surge of User-Generated Content (UGC) on platforms like YouTube and TikTok introduces unique challenges for HDR video quality assessment (VQA) due to diverse capture conditions, editing artifacts, and compression distortions. Existing HDR-VQA datasets primarily focus on professionally generated content (PGC), leaving a gap in understanding real-world UGC-HDR degradations. To address this, we introduce CHUG: Crowdsourced User-Generated HDR Video Quality Dataset, the first large-scale subjective study on UGC-HDR quality. CHUG comprises 856 UGC-HDR source videos, transcoded across multiple resolutions and bitrates to simulate real-world scenarios, totaling 5,992 videos. A large-scale study via Amazon Mechanical Turk collected 211,848 perceptual ratings. CHUG provides a benchmark for analyzing UGC-specific distortions in HDR videos. We anticipate CHUG will advance No-Reference (NR) HDR-VQA research by offering a large-scale, diverse, and real-world UGC dataset. The dataset is publicly available at: https://shreshthsaini.github.io/CHUG/.

<title>Closing the Data-Efficiency Gap Between Autoregressive and Masked Diffusion LLMs</title>

Abstract: Despite autoregressive large language models (arLLMs) being the current dominant paradigm in language modeling, they resist knowledge injection via fine-tuning due to inherent shortcomings such as the "reversal curse" -- the challenge of answering questions that reverse the original information order in the training sample. Masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are rapidly emerging as a powerful alternative to the arLLM paradigm, with evidence of better data efficiency and free of the "reversal curse" in pre-training. However, it is unknown whether these advantages extend to the post-training phase, i.e. whether pre-trained dLLMs can easily acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning. On three diverse datasets, we fine-tune arLLMs and dLLMs, evaluating them with forward and backward style Question Answering (QA) to probe knowledge generalization and the reversal curse. Our results confirm that arLLMs critically rely on extensive data augmentation via paraphrases for QA generalization, and paraphrases are only effective when their information order matches the QA style. Conversely, dLLMs achieve high accuracies on both forward and backward QAs without paraphrases; adding paraphrases yields only marginal gains. Lastly, inspired by the dLLM's performance, we introduce a novel masked fine-tuning paradigm for knowledge injection into pre-trained arLLMs. This proposed method successfully and drastically improves the data efficiency of arLLM fine-tuning, effectively closing the performance gap with dLLMs.

<title>Probabilistic bias adjustment of seasonal predictions of Arctic Sea Ice Concentration</title>

Abstract: Seasonal forecast of Arctic sea ice concentration is key to mitigate the negative impact and assess potential opportunities posed by the rapid decline of sea ice coverage. Seasonal prediction systems based on climate models often show systematic biases and complex spatio-temporal errors that grow with the forecasts. Consequently, operational predictions are routinely bias corrected and calibrated using retrospective forecasts. For predictions of Arctic sea ice concentration, error corrections are mainly based on one-to-one post-processing methods including climatological mean or linear regression correction and, more recently, machine learning. Such deterministic adjustments are confined at best to the limited number of costly-to-run ensemble members of the raw forecast. However, decision-making requires proper quantification of uncertainty and likelihood of events, particularly of extremes. We introduce a probabilistic error correction framework based on a conditional Variational Autoencoder model to map the conditional distribution of observations given the biased model prediction. This method naturally allows for generating large ensembles of adjusted forecasts. We evaluate our model using deterministic and probabilistic metrics and show that the adjusted forecasts are better calibrated, closer to the observational distribution, and have smaller errors than climatological mean adjusted forecasts.

<title>Chain-of-Influence: Tracing Interdependencies Across Time and Features in Clinical Predictive Modelings</title>

Abstract: Modeling clinical time-series data is hampered by the challenge of capturing latent, time-varying dependencies among features. State-of-the-art approaches often rely on black-box mechanisms or simple aggregation, failing to explicitly model how the influence of one clinical variable propagates through others over time. We propose $\textbf{Chain-of-Influence (CoI)}$, an interpretable deep learning framework that constructs an explicit, time-unfolded graph of feature interactions. CoI leverages a multi-level attention architecture: first, a temporal attention layer identifies critical time points in a patient's record; second, a cross-feature attention layer models the directed influence from features at these time points to subsequent features. This design enables the tracing of influence pathways, providing a granular audit trail that shows how any feature at any time contributes to the final prediction, both directly and through its influence on other variables. We evaluate CoI on mortality and disease progression tasks using the MIMIC-IV dataset and a private chronic kidney disease cohort. Our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in predictive accuracy. More importantly, through case studies, we show that CoI can uncover clinically meaningful, patient-specific patterns of disease progression that are opaque to other models, offering unprecedented transparency into the temporal and cross-feature dependencies that inform clinical decision-making.

<title>Learning Bug Context for PyTorch-to-JAX Translation with LLMs</title>

Abstract: Despite recent progress of large language models (LLMs) on code translation among mainstream languages, translating PyTorch to JAX remains nontrivial. The two libraries, though both embedded in Python, differ in core design, execution semantics, and ecosystem maturity; JAX is newer and comparatively underrepresented in public code, and parallel PyTorch--JAX corpora are limited. Weaknesses in existing evaluation further complicate cross-framework benchmarking. We present T2J, a prompt-augmentation framework that strengthens LLM-based PyTorch to JAX translation. Our pipeline (i) assembles two PyTorch sources -- the problem-solving set from TorchLeet (Aroori & Chien, 2025) and a GitHub-derived set from CodeParrot (Wolf et al., 2022) -- and uses GPT-4o-mini to produce initial JAX drafts; (ii) engages two professional developers to iteratively repair those drafts until functional equivalence, yielding a curated fixed-bug dataset of common errors and patches; and (iii) constructs augmented prompts that inject structured guidance from these fixes to steer lightweight LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-mini). We also introduce three metrics tailored to PyTorch to JAX: T2J CodeTrans Score, T2J FixCost Score (an LLM-based estimate of bug-fix effort), and T2J Comparison Score (LLM-as-judge). Empirically, T2J raises GPT-4o-mini performance by up to 10% on CodeBLEU, 50% on T2J FixCost Score, 1.33 points on T2J CodeTrans Score (0--4 scale), and 100% on T2J Comparison Score; moreover, the generated code runs up to 2.5x faster than the baseline.

Abstract: Despite their widespread use, training deep Transformers can be unstable. Layer normalization, a standard component, improves training stability, but its placement has often been ad-hoc. In this paper, we conduct a principled study on the forward (hidden states) and backward (gradient) stability of Transformers under different layer normalization placements. Our theory provides key insights into the training dynamics: whether training drives Transformers toward regular solutions or pathological behaviors. For forward stability, we derive explicit bounds on the growth of hidden states in trained Transformers. For backward stability, we analyze how layer normalization affects the backpropagation of gradients, thereby explaining the training dynamics of each layer normalization placement. Our analysis also guides the scaling of residual steps in Transformer blocks, where appropriate choices can further improve stability and performance. Our numerical results corroborate our theoretical findings. Beyond these results, our framework provides a principled way to sanity-check the stability of Transformers under new architectural modifications, offering guidance for future designs.

Abstract: Property-based testing (PBT) is a lightweight formal method, typically implemented as a randomized testing framework. Users specify the input domain for their test using combinators supplied by the PBT framework, and the expected properties or invariants as a unit-test function. The framework then searches for a counterexample, e.g. by generating inputs and calling the test function. In this work, we demonstrate an LLM-based agent which analyzes Python modules, infers function-specific and cross-function properties from code and documentation, synthesizes and executes PBTs, reflects on outputs of these tests to confirm true bugs, and finally outputs actionable bug reports for the developer. We perform an extensive evaluation of our agent across 100 popular Python packages. Of the bug reports generated by the agent, we found after manual review that 56\% were valid bugs and 32\% were valid bugs that we would report to maintainers. We then developed a ranking rubric to surface high-priority valid bugs to developers, and found that of the 21 top-scoring bugs, 86\% were valid and 81\% we would report. The bugs span diverse failure modes from serialization failures to numerical precision errors to flawed cache implementations. We reported 5 bugs, 4 with patches, including to NumPy and cloud computing SDKs, with 3 patches merged successfully. Our results suggest that LLMs with PBT provides a rigorous and scalable method for autonomously testing software. Our code and artifacts are available at: https://github.com/mmaaz-git/agentic-pbt.

Abstract: The relevance of this research lies in the growing demand for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) capable of operating reliably in complex environments where conventional navigation becomes unreliable due to interference, poor visibility, or camouflage. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides unique opportunities for UAV-based computer vision by enabling fine-grained material recognition and object differentiation, which are critical for navigation, surveillance, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. The aim of this work is to develop a deep learning architecture integrating HSI into UAV perception for navigation, object detection, and terrain classification. Objectives include: reviewing existing HSI methods, designing a hybrid 2D/3D convolutional architecture with spectral-spatial cross-attention, training, and benchmarking. The methodology is based on the modification of the Mobile 3D Vision Transformer (MDvT) by introducing the proposed SpectralCA block. This block employs bi-directional cross-attention to fuse spectral and spatial features, enhancing accuracy while reducing parameters and inference time. Experimental evaluation was conducted on the WHU-Hi-HongHu dataset, with results assessed using Overall Accuracy, Average Accuracy, and the Kappa coefficient. The findings confirm that the proposed architecture improves UAV perception efficiency, enabling real-time operation for navigation, object recognition, and environmental monitoring tasks.
  Keywords: SpectralCA, deep learning, computer vision, hyperspectral imaging, unmanned aerial vehicle, object detection, semi-supervised learning.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative modeling have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in molecular generation, yet the integration of comprehensive biomedical knowledge into these models has remained an untapped frontier. In this study, we introduce K-DREAM (Knowledge-Driven Embedding-Augmented Model), a novel framework that leverages knowledge graphs to augment diffusion-based generative models for drug discovery. By embedding structured information from large-scale knowledge graphs, K-DREAM directs molecular generation toward candidates with higher biological relevance and therapeutic suitability. This integration ensures that the generated molecules are aligned with specific therapeutic targets, moving beyond traditional heuristic-driven approaches. In targeted drug design tasks, K-DREAM generates drug candidates with improved binding affinities and predicted efficacy, surpassing current state-of-the-art generative models. It also demonstrates flexibility by producing molecules designed for multiple targets, enabling applications to complex disease mechanisms. These results highlight the utility of knowledge-enhanced generative models in rational drug design and their relevance to practical therapeutic development.

Abstract: This study explores the design and application of Complex-Valued Convolutional Neural Networks (CVCNNs) in audio signal processing, with a focus on preserving and utilizing phase information often neglected in real-valued networks. We begin by presenting the foundational theoretical concepts of CVCNNs, including complex convolutions, pooling layers, Wirtinger-based differentiation, and various complex-valued activation functions. These are complemented by critical adaptations of training techniques, including complex batch normalization and weight initialization schemes, to ensure stability in training dynamics. Empirical evaluations are conducted across three stages. First, CVCNNs are benchmarked on standard image datasets, where they demonstrate competitive performance with real-valued CNNs, even under synthetic complex perturbations. Although our focus is audio signal processing, we first evaluate CVCNNs on image datasets to establish baseline performance and validate training stability before applying them to audio tasks. In the second experiment, we focus on audio classification using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs). CVCNNs trained on real-valued MFCCs slightly outperform real CNNs, while preserving phase in input workflows highlights challenges in exploiting phase without architectural modifications. Finally, a third experiment introduces GNNs to model phase information via edge weighting, where the inclusion of phase yields measurable gains in both binary and multi-class genre classification. These results underscore the expressive capacity of complex-valued architectures and confirm phase as a meaningful and exploitable feature in audio processing applications. While current methods show promise, especially with activations like cardioid, future advances in phase-aware design will be essential to leverage the potential of complex representations in neural networks.

<title>MemPromptTSS: Persistent Prompt Memory for Iterative Multi-Granularity Time Series State Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Web platforms, mobile applications, and connected sensing systems generate multivariate time series with states at multiple levels of granularity, from coarse regimes to fine-grained events. Effective segmentation in these settings requires integrating across granularities while supporting iterative refinement through sparse prompt signals, which provide a compact mechanism for injecting domain knowledge. Yet existing prompting approaches for time series segmentation operate only within local contexts, so the effect of a prompt quickly fades and cannot guide predictions across the entire sequence. To overcome this limitation, we propose MemPromptTSS, a framework for iterative multi-granularity segmentation that introduces persistent prompt memory. A memory encoder transforms prompts and their surrounding subsequences into memory tokens stored in a bank. This persistent memory enables each new prediction to condition not only on local cues but also on all prompts accumulated across iterations, ensuring their influence persists across the entire sequence. Experiments on six datasets covering wearable sensing and industrial monitoring show that MemPromptTSS achieves 23% and 85% accuracy improvements over the best baseline in single- and multi-granularity segmentation under single iteration inference, and provides stronger refinement in iterative inference with average per-iteration gains of 2.66 percentage points compared to 1.19 for PromptTSS. These results highlight the importance of persistent memory for prompt-guided segmentation, establishing MemPromptTSS as a practical and effective framework for real-world applications.

Abstract: Underwater images play a crucial role in ocean research and marine environmental monitoring since they provide quality information about the ecosystem. However, the complex and remote nature of the environment results in poor image quality with issues such as low visibility, blurry textures, color distortion, and noise. In recent years, research in image enhancement has proven to be effective but also presents its own limitations, like poor generalization and heavy reliance on clean datasets. One of the challenges herein is the lack of diversity and the low quality of images included in these datasets. Also, most existing datasets consist only of monocular images, a fact that limits the representation of different lighting conditions and angles. In this paper, we propose a new plan of action to overcome these limitations. On one hand, we call for expanding the datasets using a denoising diffusion model to include a variety of image types such as stereo, wide-angled, macro, and close-up images. On the other hand, we recommend enhancing the images using Controlnet to evaluate and increase the quality of the corresponding datasets, and hence improve the study of the marine ecosystem.

Abstract: While memes are often humorous, they are frequently used to disseminate hate, causing serious harm to individuals and society. Current approaches to hateful meme detection mainly rely on pre-trained language models. However, less focus has been dedicated to \textit{what make a meme hateful}. Drawing on insights from philosophy and psychology, we argue that hateful memes are characterized by two essential features: a \textbf{presupposed context} and the expression of \textbf{false claims}. To capture presupposed context, we develop \textbf{PCM} for modeling contextual information across modalities. To detect false claims, we introduce the \textbf{FACT} module, which integrates external knowledge and harnesses cross-modal reference graphs. By combining PCM and FACT, we introduce \textbf{\textsf{SHIELD}}, a hateful meme detection framework designed to capture the fundamental nature of hate. Extensive experiments show that SHIELD outperforms state-of-the-art methods across datasets and metrics, while demonstrating versatility on other tasks, such as fake news detection.

Abstract: Edge-cloud speculative decoding (SD) accelerates inference by having a cloud-based large language model (LLM) that verifies draft tokens generated by a resource-constrained small language model (SLM) at the edge. A central bottleneck is the limited bandwidth of the edge-cloud link, which necessitates efficient compression of draft token distributions. We first derive an information-theoretic bound that decomposes the token rejection rate into contributions from SLM-LLM distribution mismatch and from quantization distortion. Guided by this analysis, we propose the Sparse Quantize-and-Sample SD (SQS-SD) framework, which exploits distributional sparsity through structured sparsification and lattice-based quantization. Within this framework, K-SQS applies fixed top-K truncation, while C-SQS adaptively adjusts the retained token set via online conformal prediction to ensure bounded deviation from the dense distribution. Empirical results confirm that both approaches improve end-to-end latency and rejection rates in complimentary operating regimes.

Abstract: Segmentation models achieve high accuracy on benchmarks but often fail in real-world domains by relying on spurious correlations instead of true object boundaries. We propose a human-in-the-loop interactive framework that enables interventional learning through targeted human corrections of segmentation outputs. Our approach treats human corrections as interventional signals that show when reliance on superficial features (e.g., color or texture) is inappropriate. The system learns from these interventions by propagating correction-informed edits across visually similar images, effectively steering the model toward robust, semantically meaningful features rather than dataset-specific artifacts. Unlike traditional annotation approaches that simply provide more training data, our method explicitly identifies when and why the model fails and then systematically corrects these failure modes across the entire dataset. Through iterative human feedback, the system develops increasingly robust representations that generalize better to novel domains and resist artifactual correlations. We demonstrate that our framework improves segmentation accuracy by up to 9 mIoU points (12-15\% relative improvement) on challenging cubemap data and yields 3-4$\times$ reductions in annotation effort compared to standard retraining, while maintaining competitive performance on benchmark datasets. This work provides a practical framework for researchers and practitioners seeking to build segmentation systems that are accurate, robust to dataset biases, data-efficient, and adaptable to real-world domains such as urban climate monitoring and autonomous driving.

Abstract: Tokenization is a crucial but under-evaluated step in large language models (LLMs). The standard metric, fertility (the average number of tokens per word), captures compression efficiency but obscures how vocabularies are allocated across languages and domains. We analyze six widely used tokenizers across seven languages and two domains, finding stable fertility for English, high fertility for Chinese, and little domain sensitivity. To address fertility's blind spots, we propose the Single Token Retention Rate (STRR), which measures the proportion of words preserved as single tokens. STRR reveals systematic prioritization of English, strong support for Chinese, and fragmentation in Hindi, offering an interpretable view of cross-lingual fairness. Our results show that STRR complements fertility and provides practical guidance for designing more equitable multilingual tokenizers.

Abstract: State aggregation aims to reduce the computational complexity of solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) while preserving the performance of the original system. A fundamental challenge lies in optimizing policies within the aggregated, or abstract, space such that the performance remains optimal in the ground MDP-a property referred to as {"}optimal policy equivalence {"}.
  This paper presents an abstraction framework based on the notion of homomorphism, in which two Markov chains are deemed homomorphic if their value functions exhibit a linear relationship. Within this theoretical framework, we establish a sufficient condition for the equivalence of optimal policy.
  We further examine scenarios where the sufficient condition is not met and derive an upper bound on the approximation error and a performance lower bound for the objective function under the ground MDP. We propose Homomorphic Policy Gradient (HPG), which guarantees optimal policy equivalence under sufficient conditions, and its extension, Error-Bounded HPG (EBHPG), which balances computational efficiency and the performance loss induced by aggregation. In the experiments, we validated the theoretical results and conducted comparative evaluations against seven algorithms.

Abstract: Organizational efforts to utilize and operationalize artificial intelligence (AI) are often accompanied by substantial challenges, including scalability, maintenance, and coordination across teams. In response, the concept of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) has emerged as a set of best practices that integrate software engineering principles with the unique demands of managing the ML lifecycle. Yet, empirical evidence on whether and how these practices support users in developing and operationalizing AI applications remains limited. To address this gap, this study analyzes over 8,000 user reviews of AI development platforms from G2.com. Using zero-shot classification, we measure review sentiment toward nine established MLOps practices, including continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), workflow orchestration, reproducibility, versioning, collaboration, and monitoring. Seven of the nine practices show a significant positive relationship with user satisfaction, suggesting that effective MLOps implementation contributes tangible value to AI development. However, organizational context also matters: reviewers from small firms discuss certain MLOps practices less frequently, suggesting that organizational context influences the prevalence and salience of MLOps, though firm size does not moderate the MLOps-satisfaction link. This indicates that once applied, MLOps practices are perceived as universally beneficial across organizational settings.

Abstract: The highly non-convex optimization landscape of modern lens design necessitates extensive human expertise, resulting in inefficiency and constrained design diversity. While automated methods are desirable, existing approaches remain limited to simple tasks or produce complex lenses with suboptimal image quality. Drawing inspiration from the synaptic pruning mechanism in mammalian neural development, this study proposes OptiNeuro--a novel automated lens design framework that first generates diverse initial structures and then progressively eliminates low-performance lenses while refining remaining candidates through gradient-based optimization. By fully automating the design of complex aspheric imaging lenses, OptiNeuro demonstrates quasi-human-level performance, identifying multiple viable candidates with minimal human intervention. This advancement not only enhances the automation level and efficiency of lens design but also facilitates the exploration of previously uncharted lens architectures.

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented search agents, such as Search-R1, are trained to reason, search, and generate the final answer iteratively. Nevertheless, due to their limited capabilities in reasoning and search, their performance on multi-hop QA benchmarks remains far from satisfactory. To handle complex or compound queries, we train an LLM-based search agent with the native capability of query expansion through reinforcement learning. In each turn, our search agent proposes several query variants, which are searched simultaneously to cover more relevant information. Meanwhile, given limited post-training data and computing resources, it is very challenging for a search agent to master multiple tasks, including query generation, retrieved information understanding, and answer generation. Therefore, we propose incorporating a pre-trained squeezer model that helps the search agent understand the retrieved documents, allowing the search agent to focus on query generation for high retrieval recall. With the assistance of the squeezer model, we discover that even a small-scale 3B LLM can demonstrate a strong capability of query expansion and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the multi-hop QA benchmarks. To be specific, our experiments across seven question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that our method, named ExpandSearch, achieves an average improvement of 4.4% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with strong gains on multi-hop reasoning tasks requiring diverse evidence aggregation.

Abstract: We present SLEAN (Simple Lightweight Ensemble Analysis Network), a deterministic framework for coordinating multiple LLM providers through text-based prompt orchestration. Unlike complex multi-agent systems requiring specialized infrastructure, SLEAN operates as a simple prompt bridge between LLMs using .txt templates, requiring no deep technical knowledge for deployment. The three-phase protocol formed by independent analysis, cross-critique, and arbitration, filters harmful AI-generated code suggestions before production deployment, addressing how AI-assisted debugging increasingly produces modifications that introduce unnecessary complexity, break existing functionality, or address problems. Evaluating 15 software bugs, we analyzed 69 AI-generated fix propositions. SLEAN's filtering accepted 22 fixes (31.9%, 95% CI 20.9-42.9%) while rejecting 47 that would have been harmful if applied verbatim. The arbitration process reduced code change surface by 83-90% relative to raw AI outputs, enforcing minimal causal edits over scope-expanding modifications. Minimal Type 2 inputs proved more efficient than detailed Type 1 inputs, requiring 2.85 versus 3.56 propositions per accepted fix (35.1% versus 28.1% acceptance, about a 20% efficiency gain). Agreement between AI systems showed weak correlation with fix quality: high convergence (at least 80%) occurred in 4 of 15 cases and improved acceptance by only 2.4% points; arbitration appeared only at exactly 10% convergence in 2 of 15 cases, although low convergence alone did not necessitate arbitration. The file-driven, provider-agnostic architecture enables deployment without specialized coding expertise, making it applicable to security auditing, code review, document verification, and other domains requiring reliable multi-provider synthesis with end-to-end auditability.

Abstract: Language models often show little to no improvement (i.e., "saturation") when trained via vanilla supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on data similar to what they saw in their training set (e.g., MATH). We introduce a new fine-tuning strategy, STAT, to train such a student model by using the metacognition ability of a stronger large language model (LLM) as the teacher. The teacher uses the task dataset to create a list of skills needed for the task, and then labels each data point with its required skills (Didolkar et al., 2024). By monitoring the student's answers, the teacher creates a Missing-Skill-Profile for the student, tracking how often they failed to apply each skill in their responses. We use this idea to build a modified training set in one of two ways. In STAT-Sel, the teacher uses an existing set of training examples but adaptively reweights them according to the Missing-Skill-Profile. In STAT-Syn, the teacher synthesizes additional examples involving missing skills. Across extensive experiments on Llama and Qwen models, our methods yield improvements of up to 7.5% on MATH, whereas SFT provides only limited gains. Furthermore, STAT enhances performance on out-of-distribution benchmarks (e.g., AIME24/25, AMC23, etc.) by an average of 4.6%. Crucially, we find that STAT is complementary to RL via GRPO (Shao et al., 2024): after the model is improved using STAT to address skill gaps, GRPO continues to add further gains. We conclude that skill-targeted adaptive training should broadly improve current training pipelines. Our code is available at: https://github.com/princeton-pli/STAT.

Abstract: Large language models work well for many NLP tasks, but they are hard to deploy in health settings with strict cost, latency, and privacy limits. We revisit a lightweight recipe for medical abstract classification and ask how far compact encoders can go under a controlled budget. Using the public medical abstracts corpus, we finetune BERT base and DistilBERT with three objectives standard cross-entropy, class weighted cross entropy, and focal loss keeping tokenizer, sequence length, optimizer, and schedule fixed. DistilBERT with plain cross-entropy gives the best balance on the test set while using far fewer parameters than BERT base. We report accuracy, Macro F1, and Weighted F1, release the evaluation code, and include confusion analyses to make error patterns clear. Our results suggest a practical default: start with a compact encoder and cross-entropy, then add calibration and task-specific checks before moving to heavier models.

<title>Efficient Onboard Vision-Language Inference in UAV-Enabled Low-Altitude Economy Networks via LLM-Enhanced Optimization</title>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Low-Altitude Economy Networks (LAENets) has enabled a variety of applications, including aerial surveillance, environmental sensing, and semantic data collection. To support these scenarios, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with onboard vision-language models (VLMs) offer a promising solution for real-time multimodal inference. However, ensuring both inference accuracy and communication efficiency remains a significant challenge due to limited onboard resources and dynamic network conditions. In this paper, we first propose a UAV-enabled LAENet system model that jointly captures UAV mobility, user-UAV communication, and the onboard visual question answering (VQA) pipeline. Based on this model, we formulate a mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem to minimize task latency and power consumption under user-specific accuracy constraints. To solve the problem, we design a hierarchical optimization framework composed of two parts: (i) an Alternating Resolution and Power Optimization (ARPO) algorithm for resource allocation under accuracy constraints, and (ii) a Large Language Model-augmented Reinforcement Learning Approach (LLaRA) for adaptive UAV trajectory optimization. The large language model (LLM) serves as an expert in refining reward design of reinforcement learning in an offline fashion, introducing no additional latency in real-time decision-making. Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework in improving inference performance and communication efficiency under dynamic LAENet conditions.

Abstract: Deep learning in small and imbalanced biomedical datasets remains fundamentally constrained by unstable optimization and poor generalization. We present the first biomedical implementation of FOSSIL (Flexible Optimization via Sample-Sensitive Importance Learning), a regret-minimizing weighting framework that adaptively balances training emphasis according to sample difficulty. Using softmax-based uncertainty as a continuous measure of difficulty, we construct a four-stage curriculum (Easy-Very Hard) and integrate FOSSIL into both convolutional and transformer-based architectures for Mpox skin lesion diagnosis. Across all settings, FOSSIL substantially improves discrimination (AUC = 0.9573), calibration (ECE = 0.053), and robustness under real-world perturbations, outperforming conventional baselines without metadata, manual curation, or synthetic augmentation. The results position FOSSIL as a generalizable, data-efficient, and interpretable framework for difficulty-aware learning in medical imaging under data scarcity.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enable end-users to delegate complex tasks to autonomous agents through natural language. However, prompt-based interaction faces critical limitations: Users often struggle to specify procedural requirements for tasks, especially those that don't have a factually correct solution but instead rely on personal preferences, such as posting social media content or planning a trip. Additionally, a ''successful'' prompt for one task may not be reusable or generalizable across similar tasks. We present ALLOY, a system inspired by classical HCI theories on Programming by Demonstration (PBD), but extended to enhance adaptability in creating LLM-based web agents. ALLOY enables users to express procedural preferences through natural demonstrations rather than prompts, while making these procedures transparent and editable through visualized workflows that can be generalized across task variations. In a study with 12 participants, ALLOY's demonstration--based approach outperformed prompt-based agents and manual workflows in capturing user intent and procedural preferences in complex web tasks. Insights from the study also show how demonstration--based interaction complements the traditional prompt-based approach.

<title>Think Twice to See More: Iterative Visual Reasoning in Medical VLMs</title>

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image-text understanding but typically rely on a single-pass reasoning that neglects localized visual cues. In clinical practice, however, human experts iteratively scan, focus, and refine the regions of interest before reaching a final diagnosis. To narrow this machine-human perception gap, we introduce ViTAR, a novel VLM framework that emulates the iterative reasoning process of human experts through a cognitive chain of "think-act-rethink-answer". ViTAR treats medical images as interactive objects, enabling models to engage multi-step visual reasoning. To support this approach, we curate a high-quality instruction dataset comprising 1K interactive examples that encode expert-like diagnostic behaviors. In addition, a 16K visual question answering training data has been curated towards fine-grained visual diagnosis. We introduce a two-stage training strategy that begins with supervised fine-tuning to guide cognitive trajectories, followed by the reinforcement learning to optimize decision-making. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ViTAR outperforms strong state-of-the-art models. Visual attention analysis reveals that from the "think" to "rethink" rounds, ViTAR increasingly anchors visual grounding to clinically critical regions and maintains high attention allocation to visual tokens during reasoning, providing mechanistic insight into its improved performance. These findings demonstrate that embedding expert-style iterative thinking chains into VLMs enhances both performance and trustworthiness of medical AI.

Abstract: When modeling a given type of data, we consider it to involve two key aspects: 1) identifying relevant elements (e.g., image pixels or textual words) to a central element, as in a convolutional receptive field, or to a query element, as in self-attention, and 2) encoding these tokens effectively. Self-attention can adaptively identify these elements but relies on absolute positional embedding for structural representation learning. In contrast, convolution encodes elements in a relative manner, yet their fixed kernel size limits their ability to adaptively select the relevant elements. In this paper, we introduce Translution, an operation that unifies the adaptive identification capability of self-attention and the relative encoding advantage of convolution. However, this integration leads to a substantial increase in the number of parameters, exceeding most currently available computational resources. Therefore, we propose a lightweight variant of Translution, named {\alpha}-Translution. Experiments on computer vision and natural language processing tasks show that Translution (including {\alpha}-Translution) achieves superior accuracy compared to self-attention. The code is available at https://github.com/hehefan/Translution.

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced NLP, but interpretability remains limited, especially in healthcare and finance. Concept bottleneck models tie predictions to human concepts in vision, but NLP versions either use binary activations that harm text representations or latent concepts that weaken semantics, and they rarely model dynamic concept interactions such as negation and context. We introduce the Concept Language Model Network (CLMN), a neural-symbolic framework that keeps both performance and interpretability. CLMN represents concepts as continuous, human-readable embeddings and applies fuzzy-logic reasoning to learn adaptive interaction rules that state how concepts affect each other and the final decision. The model augments original text features with concept-aware representations and automatically induces interpretable logic rules. Across multiple datasets and pre-trained language models, CLMN achieves higher accuracy than existing concept-based methods while improving explanation quality. These results show that integrating neural representations with symbolic reasoning in a unified concept space can yield practical, transparent NLP systems.

<title>OBsmith: Testing JavaScript Obfuscator using LLM-powered sketching</title>

Abstract: JavaScript obfuscators are widely deployed to protect intellectual property and resist reverse engineering, yet their correctness has been largely overlooked compared to performance and resilience. Existing evaluations typically measure resistance to deobfuscation, leaving the critical question of whether obfuscators preserve program semantics unanswered. Incorrect transformations can silently alter functionality, compromise reliability, and erode security-undermining the very purpose of obfuscation. To address this gap, we present OBsmith, a novel framework to systematically test JavaScript obfuscators using large language models (LLMs). OBsmith leverages LLMs to generate program sketches abstract templates capturing diverse language constructs, idioms, and corner cases-which are instantiated into executable programs and subjected to obfuscation under different configurations. Besides LLM-powered sketching, OBsmith also employs a second source: automatic extraction of sketches from real programs. This extraction path enables more focused testing of project specific features and lets developers inject domain knowledge into the resulting test cases. OBsmith uncovers 11 previously unknown correctness bugs. Under an equal program budget, five general purpose state-of-the-art JavaScript fuzzers (FuzzJIT, Jsfunfuzz, Superion, DIE, Fuzzilli) failed to detect these issues, highlighting OBsmith's complementary focus on obfuscation induced misbehavior. An ablation shows that all components except our generic MRs contribute to at least one bug class; the negative MR result suggests the need for obfuscator-specific metamorphic relations. Our results also seed discussion on how to balance obfuscation presets and performance cost. We envision OBsmith as an important step towards automated testing and quality assurance of obfuscators and other semantic-preserving toolchains.

Abstract: Deep learning models have attracted lots of research attention in time series classification (TSC) task in the past two decades. Recently, deep neural networks (DNN) have surpassed classical distance-based methods and achieved state-of-the-art performance. Despite their promising performance, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to rely on spurious correlations present in the training data, which can hinder generalization. For instance, a model might incorrectly associate the presence of grass with the label ``cat" if the training set have majority of cats lying in grassy backgrounds. However, the shortcut behavior of DNNs in time series remain under-explored. Most existing shortcut work are relying on external attributes such as gender, patients group, instead of focus on the internal bias behavior in time series models.
  In this paper, we take the first step to investigate and establish point-based shortcut learning behavior in deep learning time series classification. We further propose a simple detection method based on other class to detect shortcut occurs without relying on test data or clean training classes. We test our proposed method in UCR time series datasets.

Abstract: The quickly growing popularity of AI companions poses risks to mental health, personal wellbeing, and social relationships. Past work has identified many individual factors that can drive human-companion interaction, but we know little about how these factors interact and evolve over time. In Study 1, we surveyed AI companion users (N = 303) to map the psychological pathway from users' mental models of the agent to parasocial experiences, social interaction, and the psychological impact of AI companions. Participants' responses foregrounded multiple interconnected variables (agency, parasocial interaction, and engagement) that shape AI companionship. In Study 2, we conducted a longitudinal study with a subset of participants (N = 110) using a new generic chatbot. Participants' perceptions of the generic chatbot significantly converged to perceptions of their own companions by Week 3. These results suggest a longitudinal model of AI companionship development and demonstrate an empirical method to study human-AI companionship.

<title>Pharmacist: Safety Alignment Data Curation for Large Language Models against Harmful Fine-tuning</title>

Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning issues present significant safety challenges for fine-tuning-as-a-service in large language models. Existing alignment-stage defenses, e.g., Vaccine, Repnoise, Booster, and T-Vaccine, mitigate harmful fine-tuning issues by enhancing the model's robustness during the alignment phase. While these methods have been proposed to mitigate the issue, they often overlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment data. We observe that their defense performance and computational efficiency remain constrained by the quality and composition of the alignment dataset. To address this limitation, we propose Pharmacist, a safety alignment data curation solution that enhances defense against harmful fine-tuning by selecting a high-quality and safety-critical core subset from the original alignment data. The core idea of Pharmacist is to train an alignment data selector to rank alignment data. Specifically, up-ranking high-quality and safety-critical alignment data, down-ranking low-quality and non-safety-critical data. Empirical results indicate that models trained on datasets selected by Pharmacist outperform those trained on datasets selected by existing selection methods in both defense and inference performance. In addition, Pharmacist can be effectively integrated with mainstream alignment-stage defense methods. For example, when applied to RepNoise and T-Vaccine, using the dataset selected by Pharmacist instead of the full dataset leads to improvements in defense performance by 2.60\% and 3.30\%, respectively, and enhances inference performance by 3.50\% and 1.10\%. Notably, it reduces training time by 56.83\% and 57.63\%, respectively. Our code is available at https://github.com/Lslland/Pharmacist.

Abstract: While looped transformers (termed as Looped-Attn) often outperform standard transformers (termed as Single-Attn) on complex reasoning tasks, the theoretical basis for this advantage remains underexplored. In this paper, we explain this phenomenon through the lens of loss landscape geometry, inspired by empirical observations of their distinct dynamics at both sample and Hessian levels. To formalize this, we extend the River-Valley landscape model by distinguishing between U-shaped valleys (flat) and V-shaped valleys (steep). Based on empirical observations, we conjecture that the recursive architecture of Looped-Attn induces a landscape-level inductive bias towards River-V-Valley. Theoretical derivations based on this inductive bias guarantee a better loss convergence along the river due to valley hopping, and further encourage learning about complex patterns compared to the River-U-Valley induced by Single-Attn. Building on this insight, we propose SHIFT (Staged HIerarchical Framework for Progressive Training), a staged training framework that accelerates the training process of Looped-Attn while achieving comparable performances.

Abstract: We introduce a machine-learning framework based on symbolic regression to extract the full symbol alphabet of multi-loop Feynman integrals. By targeting the analytic structure rather than reduction, the method is broadly applicable and interpretable across different families of integrals. It successfully reconstructs complete symbol alphabets in nontrivial examples, demonstrating both robustness and generality. Beyond accelerating computations case by case, it uncovers the analytic structure universally. This framework opens new avenues for multi-loop amplitude analysis and provides a versatile tool for exploring scattering amplitudes.

Abstract: Accurate fire and smoke detection is critical for safety and disaster response, yet existing vision-based methods face challenges in balancing efficiency and reliability. Compact deep learning models such as YOLOv5n and YOLOv8n are widely adopted for deployment on UAVs, CCTV systems, and IoT devices, but their reduced capacity often results in false positives and missed detections. Conventional post-detection methods such as Non-Maximum Suppression and Soft-NMS rely only on spatial overlap, which can suppress true positives or retain false alarms in cluttered or ambiguous fire scenes. To address these limitations, we propose an uncertainty aware post-detection framework that rescales detection confidences using both statistical uncertainty and domain relevant visual cues. A lightweight Confidence Refinement Network integrates uncertainty estimates with color, edge, and texture features to adjust detection scores without modifying the base model. Experiments on the D-Fire dataset demonstrate improved precision, recall, and mean average precision compared to existing baselines, with only modest computational overhead. These results highlight the effectiveness of post-detection rescoring in enhancing the robustness of compact deep learning models for real-world fire and smoke detection.

Abstract: Advances in image tampering pose serious security threats, underscoring the need for effective image manipulation localization (IML). While supervised IML achieves strong performance, it depends on costly pixel-level annotations. Existing weakly supervised or training-free alternatives often underperform and lack interpretability. We propose the In-Context Forensic Chain (ICFC), a training-free framework that leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for interpretable IML tasks. ICFC integrates an objectified rule construction with adaptive filtering to build a reliable knowledge base and a multi-step progressive reasoning pipeline that mirrors expert forensic workflows from coarse proposals to fine-grained forensics results. This design enables systematic exploitation of MLLM reasoning for image-level classification, pixel-level localization, and text-level interpretability. Across multiple benchmarks, ICFC not only surpasses state-of-the-art training-free methods but also achieves competitive or superior performance compared to weakly and fully supervised approaches.

Abstract: Computer vision and image processing applications suffer from dark and low-light images, particularly during real-time image transmission. Currently, low light and dark images are converted to bright and colored forms using autoencoders; however, these methods often achieve low SSIM and PSNR scores and require high computational power due to their large number of parameters. To address these challenges, the DeepFusionNet architecture has been developed. According to the results obtained with the LOL-v1 dataset, DeepFusionNet achieved an SSIM of 92.8% and a PSNR score of 26.30, while containing only approximately 2.5 million parameters. On the other hand, conversion of blurry and low-resolution images into high-resolution and blur-free images has gained importance in image processing applications. Unlike GAN-based super-resolution methods, an autoencoder-based super resolution model has been developed that contains approximately 100 thousand parameters and uses the DeepFusionNet architecture. According to the results of the tests, the DeepFusionNet based super-resolution method achieved a PSNR of 25.30 and a SSIM score of 80.7 percent according to the validation set.

Abstract: Generalist robot policies can now perform a wide range of manipulation skills, but evaluating and improving their ability with unfamiliar objects and instructions remains a significant challenge. Rigorous evaluation requires a large number of real-world rollouts, while systematic improvement demands additional corrective data with expert labels. Both of these processes are slow, costly, and difficult to scale. World models offer a promising, scalable alternative by enabling policies to rollout within imagination space. However, a key challenge is building a controllable world model that can handle multi-step interactions with generalist robot policies. This requires a world model compatible with modern generalist policies by supporting multi-view prediction, fine-grained action control, and consistent long-horizon interactions, which is not achieved by previous works. In this paper, we make a step forward by introducing a controllable multi-view world model that can be used to evaluate and improve the instruction-following ability of generalist robot policies. Our model maintains long-horizon consistency with a pose-conditioned memory retrieval mechanism and achieves precise action control through frame-level action conditioning. Trained on the DROID dataset (95k trajectories, 564 scenes), our model generates spatially and temporally consistent trajectories under novel scenarios and new camera placements for over 20 seconds. We show that our method can accurately rank policy performance without real-world robot rollouts. Moreover, by synthesizing successful trajectories in imagination and using them for supervised fine-tuning, our approach can improve policy success by 44.7\%.

<title>CacheClip: Accelerating RAG with Effective KV Cache Reuse</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems suffer from severe time-to-first-token (TTFT) bottlenecks due to long input sequences. Existing KV cache reuse methods face a fundamental trade-off: prefix caching requires identical prefixes that rarely occur in RAG scenarios, while direct precomputation sacrifices quality due to missing inter-chunk attention and repeated attention sinks. Recent methods like APE and CacheBlend partially address these issues but remain inadequate for robust RAG applications. This paper presents CacheClip, a novel framework that achieves both fast TTFT and high generation quality. Our key insight is that small auxiliary LLMs exhibit similar last-layer attention distributions to primary LLMs (the target model for generation), enabling efficient identification of tokens critical for restoring inter-chunk attention, thereby significantly improving response quality on cross-chunk reasoning tasks. CacheClip integrates three techniques: (1) auxiliary-model-guided token selection for selective KV cache recomputation, where the auxiliary model is finetuned to improve selection accuracy, (2) shared prefixes to eliminate redundant attention sinks, and (3) grouping strategy to maintain local coherence during partial KV cache updates. Experiments show CacheClip retains up to 94.8% and 85.0% of full-attention performance on NIAH and LongBench, outperforming APE and CacheBlend by 25.2% and 35.1% on NIAH (with reomp% = 20%). Meanwhile, CacheClip accelerates LLM inference by up to 1.92x in prefill time, providing a practical solution to the efficiency-quality trade-off in RAG systems.

Abstract: Channel permutation is a powerful technique for enhancing the accuracy of N:M sparse models by reordering the channels of weight matrices to prioritize the retention of important weights. However, traditional channel permutation methods rely on handcrafted quality metrics, which often fail to accurately capture the true impact of pruning on model performance. To address this limitation, we propose PermLLM, a novel post-training pruning framework that introduces learnable channel permutation (LCP) for N:M sparsity. LCP leverages Sinkhorn normalization to transform discrete permutation matrices into differentiable soft permutation matrices, enabling end-to-end optimization. Additionally, PermLLM incorporates an efficient block-wise channel permutation strategy, which significantly reduces the number of learnable parameters and computational complexity. PermLLM seamlessly integrates with existing one-shot pruning methods to adaptively optimize channel permutations, effectively mitigating pruning-induced errors. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA series, Qwen, and OPT models demonstrate that PermLLM achieves superior performance in optimizing N:M sparse models. The code is available at https://github.com/lanchengzou/PermLLM.

Abstract: Information extraction from copy-heavy documents, characterized by massive volumes of structurally similar content, represents a critical yet understudied challenge in enterprise document processing. We present a systematic framework that strategically combines OCR engines with Large Language Models (LLMs) to optimize the accuracy-efficiency trade-off inherent in repetitive document extraction tasks. Unlike existing approaches that pursue universal solutions, our method exploits document-specific characteristics through intelligent strategy selection. We implement and evaluate 25 configurations across three extraction paradigms (direct, replacement, and table-based) on identity documents spanning four formats (PNG, DOCX, XLSX, PDF). Through table-based extraction methods, our adaptive framework delivers outstanding results: F1=1.0 accuracy with 0.97s latency for structured documents, and F1=0.997 accuracy with 0.6 s for challenging image inputs when integrated with PaddleOCR, all while maintaining sub-second processing speeds. The 54 times performance improvement compared with multimodal methods over naive approaches, coupled with format-aware routing, enables processing of heterogeneous document streams at production scale. Beyond the specific application to identity extraction, this work establishes a general principle: the repetitive nature of copy-heavy tasks can be transformed from a computational burden into an optimization opportunity through structure-aware method selection.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate decisions in domains where unfair treatment of demographic groups is unacceptable. Existing work probes when biased outputs appear, but gives little insight into the mechanisms that generate them, leaving existing mitigations largely fragile. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation LLM unfairness and propose DiffHeads, a lightweight debiasing framework for LLMs. We first compare Direct-Answer (DA) prompting to Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting across eight representative open- and closed-source LLMs. DA will trigger the nature bias part of LLM and improve measured unfairness by 534.5%-391.9% in both one-turn and two-turn dialogues. Next, we define a token-to-head contribution score that traces each token's influence back to individual attention heads. This reveals a small cluster of bias heads that activate under DA but stay largely dormant with CoT, providing the first causal link between prompting strategy and bias emergence. Finally, building on this insight, we propose DiffHeads that identifies bias heads through differential activation analysis between DA and CoT, and selectively masks only those heads. DiffHeads reduces unfairness by 49.4%, and 40.3% under DA and CoT, respectively, without harming model utility.

Abstract: Current approaches for time series forecasting, whether in the time or frequency domain, predominantly use deep learning models based on linear layers or transformers. They often encode time series data in a black-box manner and rely on trial-and-error optimization solely based on forecasting performance, leading to limited interpretability and theoretical understanding. Furthermore, the dynamics in data distribution over time and frequency domains pose a critical challenge to accurate forecasting. We propose FIRE, a unified frequency domain decomposition framework that provides a mathematical abstraction for diverse types of time series, so as to achieve interpretable and robust time series forecasting. FIRE introduces several key innovations: (i) independent modeling of amplitude and phase components, (ii) adaptive learning of weights of frequency basis components, (iii) a targeted loss function, and (iv) a novel training paradigm for sparse data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FIRE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models on long-term forecasting benchmarks, achieving superior predictive performance and significantly enhancing interpretability of time series

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can enhance LLM reasoning, its training process poses a critical risk: entropy collapse. This phenomenon is a rapid loss of policy diversity, stemming from the exploration-exploitation imbalance and leading to a lack of generalization. Recent entropy-intervention methods aim to prevent \coloredtext{entropy collapse}, yet their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this paper, we conduct a quantitative analysis to reveal token-level entropy changes and how existing entropy intervention methods help avoid entropy collapse. Our findings point out a fundamental limitation of existing methods: they attempt to control entropy dynamics indirectly. By only affecting related factors, such as the advantage signal and generation probability, their effectiveness is inherently limited and could potentially fail. To address this limitation, we introduce an entropy-change-aware reweighting scheme, namely Stabilizing Token-level Entropy-changE via Reweighting (STEER), that adaptively stabilizes entropy dynamics through fine-grained token-level adjustments. Our approach mitigates over-exploitation while fostering robust exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STEER significantly mitigates entropy collapse, stabilizes entropy dynamics, and achieves stronger downstream performance across various mathematical reasoning benchmarks \footnote{Our code is available at https://github.com/zz-haooo/STEER.

Abstract: Multi-LLM systems enhance the creativity of large language models by simulating human collective intelligence but suffer from significant drawbacks, such as high computational costs and inference latency. To address these limitations, we propose BILLY (BlendIng persona vectors for Large Language model creativitY), a training-free framework that captures the benefits of multi-LLM collaboration, i.e. inducing diverse perspectives and specialized expertise, within a single model. BILLY operates by extracting and blending multiple distinct persona vectors directly in the model's activation space. We steer the model's generation process with this merged vector while inference, enabling multi-perspective output without explicit multi-LLM communication. Our experiments across creativity-oriented benchmarks demonstrate that BILLY surpasses single model prompting and traditional multi-LLM approaches, while substantially reducing inference time and computational costs. Our analyses further reveal that distinct persona vectors can be blended to achieve both effective control over complementary aspects of generation and greater interpretability.

<title>Multi-Scale Diffusion Transformer for Jointly Simulating User Mobility and Mobile Traffic Pattern</title>

Abstract: User mobility trajectory and mobile traffic data are essential for a wide spectrum of applications including urban planning, network optimization, and emergency management. However, large-scale and fine-grained mobility data remains difficult to obtain due to privacy concerns and collection costs, making it essential to simulate realistic mobility and traffic patterns. User trajectories and mobile traffic are fundamentally coupled, reflecting both physical mobility and cyber behavior in urban environments. Despite this strong interdependence, existing studies often model them separately, limiting the ability to capture cross-modal dynamics. Therefore, a unified framework is crucial. In this paper, we propose MSTDiff, a Multi-Scale Diffusion Transformer for joint simulation of mobile traffic and user trajectories. First, MSTDiff applies discrete wavelet transforms for multi-resolution traffic decomposition. Second, it uses a hybrid denoising network to process continuous traffic volumes and discrete location sequences. A transition mechanism based on urban knowledge graph embedding similarity is designed to guide semantically informed trajectory generation. Finally, a multi-scale Transformer with cross-attention captures dependencies between trajectories and traffic. Experiments show that MSTDiff surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in traffic and trajectory generation tasks, reducing Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) across key statistical metrics by up to 17.38% for traffic generation, and by an average of 39.53% for trajectory generation.

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) aims to segment the target object in an image given a natural language expression. While recent methods leverage pre-trained vision backbones and more training corpus to achieve impressive results, they predominantly focus on simple expressions--short, clear noun phrases like "red car" or "left girl". This simplification often reduces RIS to a key word/concept matching problem, limiting the model's ability to handle referential ambiguity in expressions. In this work, we identify two challenging real-world scenarios: object-distracting expressions, which involve multiple entities with contextual cues, and category-implicit expressions, where the object class is not explicitly stated. To address the challenges, we propose a novel framework, SaFiRe, which mimics the human two-phase cognitive process--first forming a global understanding, then refining it through detail-oriented inspection. This is naturally supported by Mamba's scan-then-update property, which aligns with our phased design and enables efficient multi-cycle refinement with linear complexity. We further introduce aRefCOCO, a new benchmark designed to evaluate RIS models under ambiguous referring expressions. Extensive experiments on both standard and proposed datasets demonstrate the superiority of SaFiRe over state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized artificial intelligence, shifting from supporting objective tasks (e.g., recognition) to empowering subjective decision-making (e.g., planning, decision). This marks the dawn of general and powerful AI, with applications spanning a wide range of fields, including programming, education, healthcare, finance, and law. However, their deployment introduces multifaceted risks. Due to the black-box nature of LLMs and the human-like quality of their generated content, issues such as hallucinations, bias, unfairness, and copyright infringement become particularly significant. In this context, sourcing information from multiple perspectives is essential.
  This survey presents a systematic investigation into provenance tracking for content generated by LLMs, organized around four interrelated dimensions that together capture both model- and data-centric perspectives. From the model perspective, Model Sourcing treats the model as a whole, aiming to distinguish content generated by specific LLMs from content authored by humans. Model Structure Sourcing delves into the internal generative mechanisms, analyzing architectural components that shape the outputs of model. From the data perspective, Training Data Sourcing focuses on internal attribution, tracing the origins of generated content back to the training data of model. In contrast, External Data Sourcing emphasizes external validation, identifying external information used to support or influence the responses of model. Moreover, we also propose a dual-paradigm taxonomy that classifies existing sourcing methods into prior-based (proactive traceability embedding) and posterior-based (retrospective inference) approaches. Traceability across these dimensions enhances the transparency, accountability, and trustworthiness of LLMs deployment in real-world applications.

Abstract: In pose estimation for seen objects, a prevalent pipeline involves using neural networks to predict dense 3D coordinates of the object surface on 2D images, which are then used to establish dense 2D-3D correspondences. However, current methods primarily focus on more efficient encoding techniques to improve the precision of predicted 3D coordinates on the object's front surface, overlooking the potential benefits of incorporating the back surface and interior of the object. To better utilize the full surface and interior of the object, this study predicts 3D coordinates of both the object's front and back surfaces and densely samples 3D coordinates between them. This process creates ultra-dense 2D-3D correspondences, effectively enhancing pose estimation accuracy based on the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm. Additionally, we propose Hierarchical Continuous Coordinate Encoding (HCCE) to provide a more accurate and efficient representation of front and back surface coordinates. Experimental results show that, compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the BOP website, the proposed approach outperforms across seven classic BOP core datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/WangYuLin-SEU/HCCEPose.

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized software testing, particularly fuzz testing, by automating the generation of diverse and effective test inputs. This advancement holds great promise for improving software reliability. Meanwhile, the introduction of MOJO, a high-performance AI programming language blending Python's usability with the efficiency of C and C++, presents new opportunities to enhance AI model scalability and programmability. However, as a new language, MOJO lacks comprehensive testing frameworks and a sufficient corpus for LLM-based testing, which exacerbates model hallucination. In this case, LLMs will generate syntactically valid but semantically incorrect code, significantly reducing the effectiveness of fuzz testing. To address this challenge, we propose MOJOFuzzer, the first adaptive LLM-based fuzzing framework designed for zero-shot learning environments of emerging programming languages. MOJOFuzzer integrates a mutil-phase framework that systematically eliminates low-quality generated inputs before execution, significantly improving test case validity. Furthermore, MOJOFuzzer dynamically adapts LLM prompts based on runtime feedback for test case mutation, enabling an iterative learning process that continuously enhances fuzzing efficiency and bug detection performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that MOJOFuzzer significantly enhances test validity, API coverage, and bug detection performance, outperforming traditional fuzz testing and state-of-the-art LLM-based fuzzing approaches. Using MOJOFuzzer, we have conducted a first large-scale fuzz testing evaluation of MOJO, uncorvering 13 previous unknown bugs. This study not only advances the field of LLM-driven software testing but also establishes a foundational methodology for leveraging LLMs in the testing of emerging programming languages.

Abstract: Embodied agents face a fundamental limitation: once deployed in real-world environments to perform specific tasks, they are unable to acquire new useful knowledge to enhance task performance. In this paper, we propose a general post-deployment learning framework called Dejavu, which employs an Experience Feedback Network (EFN) and augments the frozen Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policy with retrieved execution memories. EFN automatically identifies contextually successful prior action experiences and conditions action prediction on this retrieved guidance. We adopt reinforcement learning with semantic similarity rewards on EFN to ensure that the predicted actions align with past successful behaviors under current observations. During deployment, EFN continually enriches its memory with new trajectories, enabling the agent to exhibit "learning from experience" despite fixed weights. Experiments across diverse embodied tasks show that EFN significantly improves adaptability, robustness, and success rates over frozen baselines. These results highlight a promising path toward embodied agents that continually refine their behavior after deployment.

Abstract: Reasoning is an important task for large language models (LLMs). Among all the reasoning paradigms, inductive reasoning is one of the fundamental types, which is characterized by its particular-to-general thinking process and the non-uniqueness of its answers. The inductive mode is crucial for knowledge generalization and aligns better with human cognition, so it is a fundamental mode of learning, hence attracting increasing interest. Despite the importance of inductive reasoning, there is no systematic summary of it. Therefore, this paper presents the first comprehensive survey of inductive reasoning for LLMs. First, methods for improving inductive reasoning are categorized into three main areas: post-training, test-time scaling, and data augmentation. Then, current benchmarks of inductive reasoning are summarized, and a unified sandbox-based evaluation approach with the observation coverage metric is derived. Finally, we offer some analyses regarding the source of inductive ability and how simple model architectures and data help with inductive tasks, providing a solid foundation for future research.

Abstract: While large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems show promise in simulating medical consultations, their evaluation is often confined to final-answer accuracy. This practice treats their internal collaborative processes as opaque "black boxes" and overlooks a critical question: is a diagnostic conclusion reached through a sound and verifiable reasoning pathway? The inscrutable nature of these systems poses a significant risk in high-stakes medical applications, potentially leading to flawed or untrustworthy conclusions. To address this, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of 3,600 cases from six medical datasets and six representative multi-agent frameworks. Through a rigorous, mixed-methods approach combining qualitative analysis with quantitative auditing, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of collaborative failure modes. Our quantitative audit reveals four dominant failure patterns: flawed consensus driven by shared model deficiencies, suppression of correct minority opinions, ineffective discussion dynamics, and critical information loss during synthesis. This study demonstrates that high accuracy alone is an insufficient measure of clinical or public trust. It highlights the urgent need for transparent and auditable reasoning processes, a cornerstone for the responsible development and deployment of medical AI.

Our approach is based on encoding the planning problem into a network of timed automata, and then using an efficient model checker on the network followed by a certificate checker to certify the output of the model checker. Our approach prioritises trustworthiness of the certification: we formally verify our implementation of the encoding to timed automata using the theorem prover Isabelle/HOL and we use an existing certificate checker (also formally verified in Isabelle/HOL) to certify the model checking result.

Abstract: A novel neural network inspired by Cauchy's integral formula, is proposed for function approximation tasks that include time series forecasting, missing data imputation, etc. Hence, the novel neural network is named CauchyNet. By embedding real-valued data into the complex plane, CauchyNet efficiently captures complex temporal dependencies, surpassing traditional real-valued models in both predictive performance and computational efficiency. Grounded in Cauchy's integral formula and supported by the universal approximation theorem, CauchyNet offers strong theoretical guarantees for function approximation. The architecture incorporates complex-valued activation functions, enabling robust learning from incomplete data while maintaining a compact parameter footprint and reducing computational overhead. Through extensive experiments in diverse domains, including transportation, energy consumption, and epidemiological data, CauchyNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in predictive accuracy, often achieving a 50% lower mean absolute error with fewer parameters. These findings highlight CauchyNet's potential as an effective and efficient tool for data-driven predictive modeling, particularly in resource-constrained and data-scarce environments.

Abstract: Trust is one of the most important factors shaping whether and how people adopt and rely on artificial intelligence (AI). Yet most existing studies measure trust in terms of functionality, focusing on whether a system is reliable, accurate, or easy to use, while giving less attention to the social and emotional dimensions that are increasingly relevant for today's generative AI (GenAI) systems. These systems do not just process information; they converse, respond, and collaborate with users, blurring the line between tool and partner. In this study, we introduce and validate the Human-AI Trust Scale (HAITS), a new measure designed to capture both the rational and relational aspects of trust in GenAI. Drawing on prior trust theories, qualitative interviews, and two waves of large-scale surveys in China and the United States, we used exploratory (n = 1,546) and confirmatory (n = 1,426) factor analyses to identify four key dimensions of trust: Affective Trust, Competence Trust, Benevolence & Integrity, and Perceived Risk. We then applied latent profile analysis to classify users into six distinct trust profiles, revealing meaningful differences in how affective-competence trust and trust-distrust frameworks coexist across individuals and cultures. Our findings offer a validated, culturally sensitive tool for measuring trust in GenAI and provide new insight into how trust evolves in human-AI interaction. By integrating instrumental and relational perspectives of trust, this work lays the foundation for more nuanced research and design of trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a promising framework for improving reasoning abilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, policy optimized with binary verification prone to overlook potential valuable exploration in reasoning trajectory. In view of heavy annotation cost of golden Process Reward Models (PRMs), recent works attempt using auxiliary signals for reward shaping of process tokens, involving entropy and likelihood collected from logit space. In this work, we offer a novel perspective on shaping RLVR with flow rewards derived from latent space, and propose RLFR, where the flow fields of model latents are constructed from either off-policy high-quality data and on-policy rejection sampling data, and the velocity deviations of policy latents within it are quantified to serve as a reward signal. RLFR first demonstrates that a well-established flow field can be a sound environment for reward signal collection, highlighting the expressive latent space is much underexplored. Moreover, RLFR is able to compress any off-policy expert data as reference for constituting reward signals, and we show that the efficient context dependence compressed within the hidden states are utilized, rather than individual token-level denotation for context comprehending. Experiments on both language and multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the reliability of flow rewards, and suggesting a promising paradigm for reward shaping with auxiliary signals.

<title>Distributionally Robust Control with End-to-End Statistically Guaranteed Metric Learning</title>

Abstract: Wasserstein distributionally robust control (DRC) recently emerges as a principled paradigm for handling uncertainty in stochastic dynamical systems. However, it constructs data-driven ambiguity sets via uniform distribution shifts before sequentially incorporating them into downstream control synthesis. This segregation between ambiguity set construction and control objectives inherently introduces a structural misalignment, which undesirably leads to conservative control policies with sub-optimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel end-to-end finite-horizon Wasserstein DRC framework that integrates the learning of anisotropic Wasserstein metrics with downstream control tasks in a closed-loop manner, thus enabling ambiguity sets to be systematically adjusted along performance-critical directions and yielding more effective control policies. This framework is formulated as a bilevel program: the inner level characterizes dynamical system evolution under DRC, while the outer level refines the anisotropic metric leveraging control-performance feedback across a range of initial conditions. To solve this program efficiently, we develop a stochastic augmented Lagrangian algorithm tailored to the bilevel structure. Theoretically, we prove that the learned ambiguity sets preserve statistical finite-sample guarantees under a novel radius adjustment mechanism, and we establish the well-posedness of the bilevel formulation by demonstrating its continuity with respect to the learnable metric. Furthermore, we show that the algorithm converges to stationary points of the outer level problem, which are statistically consistent with the optimal metric at a non-asymptotic convergence rate. Experiments on both numerical and inventory control tasks verify that the proposed framework achieves superior closed-loop performance and robustness compared against state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Language models have shown remarkable proficiency in code generation; nevertheless, ensuring type correctness remains a challenge. Although traditional methods, such as constrained decoding, alleviate this problem by externally rejecting untypable code, the model itself does not effectively learn type reasoning internally, which ultimately limits its overall performance. This paper introduces TyFlow, a novel system that internalizes type reasoning within code generation to guide the model to learn the type system. The core of our approach is a novel type-guided program synthesis system that maintains an isomorphism between type derivation trees and synthesis derivation trees, enabling a new code representation based on synthesis decision sequences rather than traditional text-based token sequences. By offloading the complexity of type system learning to the representation itself, models can redirect their computational resources toward higher-level program semantics. Our evaluation shows that TyFlow not only eliminates type errors but also significantly improves functional correctness, highlighting the importance of aligning LMs with type systems internally.

Abstract: Training robots to operate effectively in environments with uncertain states, such as ambiguous object properties or unpredictable interactions, remains a longstanding challenge in robotics. Imitation learning methods typically rely on successful examples and often neglect failure scenarios where uncertainty is most pronounced. To address this limitation, we propose the Uncertainty-driven Foresight Recurrent Neural Network (UF-RNN), a model that combines standard time-series prediction with an active "Foresight" module. This module performs internal simulations of multiple future trajectories and refines the hidden state to minimize predicted variance, enabling the model to selectively explore actions under high uncertainty. We evaluate UF-RNN on a door-opening task in both simulation and a real-robot setting, demonstrating that, despite the absence of explicit failure demonstrations, the model exhibits robust adaptation by leveraging self-induced chaotic dynamics in its latent space. When guided by the Foresight module, these chaotic properties stimulate exploratory behaviors precisely when the environment is ambiguous, yielding improved success rates compared to conventional stochastic RNN baselines. These findings suggest that integrating uncertainty-driven foresight into imitation learning pipelines can significantly enhance a robot's ability to handle unpredictable real-world conditions.

Abstract: This study investigates the developmental interaction between top-down (TD) and bottom-up (BU) visual attention in robotic learning. Our goal is to understand how structured, human-like attentional behavior emerges through the mutual adaptation of TD and BU mechanisms over time. To this end, we propose a novel attention model $A^3 RNN$ that integrates predictive TD signals and saliency-based BU cues through a bi-directional attention architecture.
  We evaluate our model in robotic manipulation tasks using imitation learning. Experimental results show that attention behaviors evolve throughout training, from saliency-driven exploration to prediction-driven direction. Initially, BU attention highlights visually salient regions, which guide TD processes, while as learning progresses, TD attention stabilizes and begins to reshape what is perceived as salient. This trajectory reflects principles from cognitive science and the free-energy framework, suggesting the importance of self-organizing attention through interaction between perception and internal prediction. Although not explicitly optimized for stability, our model exhibits more coherent and interpretable attention patterns than baselines, supporting the idea that developmental mechanisms contribute to robust attention formation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in specialized domains such as finance, medicine, and agriculture, where they face significant distribution shifts from their training data. Domain-specific fine-tuning can mitigate this challenge but relies on high-quality labeled data that is expensive and slow to collect in expertise-limited settings. We study label-free test-time adaptation for language models and present SyTTA, an inference-time framework that adapts models on-the-fly without additional supervision. SyTTA couples two complementary uncertainty signals that arise under distribution shift: input-side perplexity, indicating mismatch with domain-specific terminology and patterns, and output-side predictive entropy, indicating diffuse and unstable token probabilities during generation. Across diverse model architectures and domain-specific benchmarks, SyTTA delivers consistent gains. Notably, on agricultural question answering, SyTTA improves Rouge-LSum by over 120% on Qwen-2.5-7B with only 4 extra tokens per query. These results show that effective test-time adaptation for language models is achievable without labeled examples, supporting deployment in label-scarce domains. The code will be made available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Recursive self-modification is increasingly central in AutoML, neural architecture search, and adaptive optimization, yet no existing framework ensures that such changes are made safely. Godel machines offer a principled safeguard by requiring formal proofs of improvement before rewriting code; however, such proofs are unattainable in stochastic, high-dimensional settings. We introduce the Statistical Godel Machine (SGM), the first statistical safety layer for recursive edits. SGM replaces proof-based requirements with statistical confidence tests (e-values, Hoeffding bounds), admitting a modification only when superiority is certified at a chosen confidence level, while allocating a global error budget to bound cumulative risk across rounds.We also propose Confirm-Triggered Harmonic Spending (CTHS), which indexes spending by confirmation events rather than rounds, concentrating the error budget on promising edits while preserving familywise validity.Experiments across supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and black-box optimization validate this role: SGM certifies genuine gains on CIFAR-100, rejects spurious improvement on ImageNet-100, and demonstrates robustness on RL and optimization benchmarks.Together, these results position SGM as foundational infrastructure for continual, risk-aware self-modification in learning systems.Code is available at: https://github.com/gravitywavelet/sgm-anon.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is crucial for drug discovery and materials science, yet existing approaches suffer from limited interpretability, poor cross-task generalization, and lack of chemical reasoning capabilities. Traditional machine learning models struggle with task transferability, while specialized molecular language models provide little insight into their decision-making processes. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{MPPReasoner}, a multimodal large language model that incorporates chemical reasoning for molecular property prediction. Our approach, built upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, integrates molecular images with SMILES strings to enable comprehensive molecular understanding. We develop a two-stage training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using 16,000 high-quality reasoning trajectories generated through expert knowledge and multiple teacher models, followed by Reinforcement Learning from Principle-Guided Rewards (RLPGR). RLPGR employs verifiable, rule-based rewards that systematically evaluate chemical principle application, molecular structure analysis, and logical consistency through computational verification. Extensive experiments across 8 datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements, with MPPReasoner outperforming the best baselines by 7.91\% and 4.53\% on in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks respectively. MPPReasoner exhibits exceptional cross-task generalization and generates chemically sound reasoning paths that provide valuable insights into molecular property analysis, substantially enhancing both interpretability and practical utility for chemists.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate reasoning traces that appear coherent but rest on unsupported assumptions, leading to hallucinated conclusions. Prior work mainly addresses factual hallucinations or relies on post-hoc verification, leaving reasoning-induced hallucinations largely unaddressed. We propose Audit-of-Understanding (AoU), a framework that constrains inference to validated premises through three phases: (1) decomposing a query into candidate assumptions, (2) auditing their support, and (3) conditioning inference only on the validated subset. Formally, AoU is \emph{posterior-constrained inference}, connecting to selective prediction and rejection learning. Our contributions are threefold: (i) theoretical guarantees under perfect validation, (ii) excess-risk bounds under imperfect audits, and (iii) tractability analysis. Empirically, AoU improves both accuracy and faithfulness on GSM8K, MultiArith, and SVAMP, achieving up to +30% gains on GSM8K, +45% on MultiArith, and consistent +20--28% improvements on SVAMP over Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and CoT-Decoding.

Abstract: Profiling gamers provides critical insights for adaptive game design, behavioral understanding, and digital well-being. This study proposes an integrated, data-driven framework that combines psychological measures, behavioral analytics, and machine learning to reveal underlying gamer personas. A structured survey of 250 participants, including 113 active gamers, captured multidimensional behavioral, motivational, and social data. The analysis pipeline integrated feature engineering, association-network, knowledge-graph analysis, and unsupervised clustering to extract meaningful patterns. Correlation statistics uses Cramers V, Tschuprows T, Theils U, and Spearmans quantified feature associations, and network centrality guided feature selection. Dimensionality-reduction techniques such as PCA, SVD, t-SNE are coupled with clustering algorithms like K-Means, Agglomerative, Spectral, DBSCAN, evaluated using Silhouette, Calinski Harabasz, and Davies Bouldin indices. The PCA with K-Means with k = 4 model achieved optimal cluster quality with Silhouette = 0.4, identifying four archetypes as Immersive Social Story-Seekers, Disciplined Optimizers, Strategic Systems Navigators, and Competitive Team-Builders. This research contributes a reproducible pipeline that links correlation-driven network insights with unsupervised learning. The integration of behavioral correlation networks with clustering not only enhances classification accuracy but also offers a holistic lens to connect gameplay motivations with psychological and wellness outcomes.

Abstract: Unlike regular tokens derived from existing text corpora, special tokens are artificially created to annotate structured conversations during the fine-tuning process of Large Language Models (LLMs). Serving as metadata of training data, these tokens play a crucial role in instructing LLMs to generate coherent and context-aware responses. We demonstrate that special tokens can be exploited to construct four attack primitives, with which malicious users can reliably bypass the internal safety alignment of online LLM services and circumvent state-of-the-art (SOTA) external content moderation systems simultaneously. Moreover, we found that addressing this threat is challenging, as aggressive defense mechanisms-such as input sanitization by removing special tokens entirely, as suggested in academia-are less effective than anticipated. This is because such defense can be evaded when the special tokens are replaced by regular ones with high semantic similarity within the tokenizer's embedding space. We systemically evaluated our method, named MetaBreak, on both lab environment and commercial LLM platforms. Our approach achieves jailbreak rates comparable to SOTA prompt-engineering-based solutions when no content moderation is deployed. However, when there is content moderation, MetaBreak outperforms SOTA solutions PAP and GPTFuzzer by 11.6% and 34.8%, respectively. Finally, since MetaBreak employs a fundamentally different strategy from prompt engineering, the two approaches can work synergistically. Notably, empowering MetaBreak on PAP and GPTFuzzer boosts jailbreak rates by 24.3% and 20.2%, respectively.

Abstract: Successful generalist Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models rely on effective training across diverse robotic platforms with large-scale, cross-embodiment, heterogeneous datasets. To facilitate and leverage the heterogeneity in rich, diverse robotic data sources, we propose a novel Soft Prompt approach with minimally added parameters, by infusing prompt learning concepts into cross-embodiment robot learning and introducing separate sets of learnable embeddings for each distinct data source. These embeddings serve as embodiment-specific prompts, which in unity empower VLA models with effective exploitation of varying cross-embodiment features. Our new X-VLA, a neat flow-matching-based VLA architecture, relies exclusively on soft-prompted standard Transformer encoders, enjoying both scalability and simplicity. Evaluated across 6 simulations as well as 3 real-world robots, our 0.9B instantiation-X-VLA-0.9B simultaneously achieves SOTA performance over a sweep of benchmarks, demonstrating superior results on a wide axes of capabilities, from flexible dexterity to quick adaptation across embodiments, environments, and tasks.

Abstract: Clinical reasoning in medicine is a hypothesis-driven process where physicians refine diagnoses from limited information through targeted history, physical examination, and diagnostic investigations. In contrast, current medical benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) primarily assess knowledge recall through single-turn questions, where complete clinical information is provided upfront. To address this gap, we introduce VivaBench, a multi-turn benchmark that evaluates sequential clinical reasoning in LLM agents. Our dataset consists of 1762 physician-curated clinical vignettes structured as interactive scenarios that simulate a (oral) examination in medical training, requiring agents to actively probe for relevant findings, select appropriate investigations, and synthesize information across multiple steps to reach a diagnosis. While current LLMs demonstrate competence in diagnosing conditions from well-described clinical presentations, their performance degrades significantly when required to navigate iterative diagnostic reasoning under uncertainty in our evaluation. Our analysis identified several failure modes that mirror common cognitive errors in clinical practice, including: (1) fixation on initial hypotheses, (2) inappropriate investigation ordering, (3) premature diagnostic closure, and (4) failing to screen for critical conditions. These patterns reveal fundamental limitations in how current LLMs reason and make decisions under uncertainty. Through VivaBench, we provide a standardized benchmark for evaluating conversational medical AI systems for real-world clinical decision support. Beyond medical applications, we contribute to the larger corpus of research on agentic AI by demonstrating how sequential reasoning trajectories can diverge in complex decision-making environments.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into computer applications has introduced transformative capabilities but also significant security challenges. Existing safety alignments, which primarily focus on semantic interpretation, leave LLMs vulnerable to attacks that use non-standard data representations. This paper introduces ArtPerception, a novel black-box jailbreak framework that strategically leverages ASCII art to bypass the security measures of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. Unlike prior methods that rely on iterative, brute-force attacks, ArtPerception introduces a systematic, two-phase methodology. Phase 1 conducts a one-time, model-specific pre-test to empirically determine the optimal parameters for ASCII art recognition. Phase 2 leverages these insights to launch a highly efficient, one-shot malicious jailbreak attack. We propose a Modified Levenshtein Distance (MLD) metric for a more nuanced evaluation of an LLM's recognition capability. Through comprehensive experiments on four SOTA open-source LLMs, we demonstrate superior jailbreak performance. We further validate our framework's real-world relevance by showing its successful transferability to leading commercial models, including GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.7, and DeepSeek-V3, and by conducting a rigorous effectiveness analysis against potential defenses such as LLaMA Guard and Azure's content filters. Our findings underscore that true LLM security requires defending against a multi-modal space of interpretations, even within text-only inputs, and highlight the effectiveness of strategic, reconnaissance-based attacks. Content Warning: This paper includes potentially harmful and offensive model outputs.

Abstract: Real-world scenes, such as those in ScanNet, are difficult to capture, with highly limited data available. Generating realistic scenes with varied object poses remains an open and challenging task. In this work, we propose FactoredScenes, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D scenes by leveraging the underlying structure of rooms while learning the variation of object poses from lived-in scenes. We introduce a factored representation that decomposes scenes into hierarchically organized concepts of room programs and object poses. To encode structure, FactoredScenes learns a library of functions capturing reusable layout patterns from which scenes are drawn, then uses large language models to generate high-level programs, regularized by the learned library. To represent scene variations, FactoredScenes learns a program-conditioned model to hierarchically predict object poses, and retrieves and places 3D objects in a scene. We show that FactoredScenes generates realistic, real-world rooms that are difficult to distinguish from real ScanNet scenes.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a promising paradigm in language modeling, wherein additional computational resources are allocated during inference to enhance model performance. Recent approaches, such as DeepConf, have demonstrated the efficacy of this strategy, however, they often incur substantial computational overhead to achieve competitive results. In this work, we propose MatryoshkaThinking, a novel method that significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, MatryoshkaThinking attains a score of 99.79 on AIME2025 using only 4% of the computation required by DeepConf. The core of our approach lies in the recursive exploitation of the model's intrinsic capabilities in reasoning, verification, and summarization, which collectively enhance the retention of correct solutions and reduce the disparity between Pass@k and Pass@1. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple open-source models and challenging multi-modal reasoning benchmarks validate the effectiveness and generality of our method. These findings offer new insights into the design of efficient and scalable test-time inference strategies for advanced language models.

Abstract: The regulator theorem states that, under certain conditions, any optimal controller must embody a model of the system it regulates, grounding the idea that controllers embed, explicitly or implicitly, internal models of the controlled. This principle underpins neuroscience and predictive brain theories like the Free-Energy Principle or Kolmogorov/Algorithmic Agent theory. However, the theorem is only proven in limited settings. Here, we treat the deterministic, closed, coupled world-regulator system $(W,R)$ as a single self-delimiting program $p$ via a constant-size wrapper that produces the world output string~$x$ fed to the regulator. We analyze regulation from the viewpoint of the algorithmic complexity of the output, $K(x)$. We define $R$ to be a \emph{good algorithmic regulator} if it \emph{reduces} the algorithmic complexity of the readout relative to a null (unregulated) baseline $\varnothing$, i.e., \[ \Delta = K\big(O_{W,\varnothing}\big) - K\big(O_{W,R}\big) > 0. \] We then prove that the larger $\Delta$ is, the more world-regulator pairs with high mutual algorithmic information are favored. More precisely, a complexity gap $\Delta > 0$ yields \[ \Pr\big((W,R)\mid x\big) \le C\,2^{\,M(W{:}R)}\,2^{-\Delta}, \] making low $M(W{:}R)$ exponentially unlikely as $\Delta$ grows. This is an AIT version of the idea that ``the regulator contains a model of the world.'' The framework is distribution-free, applies to individual sequences, and complements the Internal Model Principle. Beyond this necessity claim, the same coding-theorem calculus singles out a \emph{canonical scalar objective} and implicates a \emph{planner}. On the realized episode, a regulator behaves \emph{as if} it minimized the conditional description length of the readout.

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents deployed in novel environments often exhibit poor sample efficiency when learning from sequential interactions. This significantly hinders the usefulness of such agents in environments where interaction is costly (for example, when they interact with humans or reset physical systems). While a number of existing LM agent architectures incorporate various mechanisms for experience storage and reflection, they make limited use of LMs' abilities to directly generate or reason about full counterfactual trajectories. We introduce ECHO (Experience Consolidation via Hindsight Optimization), a prompting framework that adapts hindsight experience replay from reinforcement learning for language model agents. ECHO generates optimized trajectories for alternative goals that could have been achieved during failed attempts, effectively creating synthetic positive examples from unsuccessful interactions. Our approach consists of two components: a hindsight rule that uses the language model itself to identify relevant subgoals and generate optimized trajectories, and an update rule that maintains compressed trajectory representations in memory. We evaluate ECHO on stateful versions of XMiniGrid, a text-based navigation and planning benchmark, and PeopleJoinQA, a collaborative information-gathering enterprise simulation. Across both domains, ECHO outperforms vanilla language agent baselines by up to 80%; in XMiniGrid, it also outperforms a number of sophisticated agent architectures including Reflexion and AWM, demonstrating faster adaptation to novel environments through more effective utilization of past experiences.

Abstract: Capacity management is critical for software organizations to allocate resources effectively and meet operational demands. An important step in capacity management is predicting future resource needs often relies on data-driven analytics and machine learning (ML) forecasting models, which require frequent retraining to stay relevant as data evolves. Continuously retraining the forecasting models can be expensive and difficult to scale, posing a challenge for engineering teams tasked with balancing accuracy and efficiency. Retraining only when the data changes appears to be a more computationally efficient alternative, but its impact on accuracy requires further investigation. In this work, we investigate the effects of retraining capacity forecasting models for time series based on detected changes in the data compared to periodic retraining. Our results show that drift-based retraining achieves comparable forecasting accuracy to periodic retraining in most cases, making it a cost-effective strategy. However, in cases where data is changing rapidly, periodic retraining is still preferred to maximize the forecasting accuracy. These findings offer actionable insights for software teams to enhance forecasting systems, reducing retraining overhead while maintaining robust performance.

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities remain a persistent risk, yet static and dynamic analyses often overlook structural dependencies that shape insecure behaviors. Viewing programs as heterogeneous graphs, we capture control- and data-flow relations as complex interaction networks. Our hybrid framework combines these graph representations with light-weight (<4B) local LLMs, uniting topological features with semantic reasoning while avoiding the cost and privacy concerns of large cloud models. Evaluated on Java vulnerability detection (binary classification), our method achieves 93.57% accuracy-an 8.36% gain over Graph Attention Network-based embeddings and 17.81% over pretrained LLM baselines such as Qwen2.5 Coder 3B. Beyond accuracy, the approach extracts salient subgraphs and generates natural language explanations, improving interpretability for developers. These results pave the way for scalable, explainable, and locally deployable tools that can shift vulnerability analysis from purely syntactic checks to deeper structural and semantic insights, facilitating broader adoption in real-world secure software development.

Abstract: The seamless integration of physical and digital environments in Cyber-Physical Systems(CPS), particularly within Industry 4.0, presents significant challenges stemming from system heterogeneity and complexity. Traditional approaches often rely on rigid, data-centric solutions like co-simulation frameworks or brittle point-to-point middleware bridges, which lack the semantic richness and flexibility required for intelligent, autonomous coordination. This report introduces the Knowledge Graph-Enhanced Multi-Agent Infrastructure(KG-MAS), as resolution in addressing such limitations. KG-MAS leverages a centralized Knowledge Graph (KG) as a dynamic, shared world model, providing a common semantic foundation for a Multi-Agent System(MAS). Autonomous agents, representing both physical and digital components, query this KG for decision-making and update it with real-time state information. The infrastructure features a model-driven architecture which facilitates the automatic generation of agents from semantic descriptions, thereby simplifying system extension and maintenance. By abstracting away underlying communication protocols and providing a unified, intelligent coordination mechanism, KG-MAS offers a robust, scalable, and flexible solution for coupling heterogeneous physical and digital robotic environments.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting pedestrian dynamics has become essential for shaping safer, more responsive, and human-centered urban environments. This study conducts a comprehensive scientometric analysis of research on data-driven pedestrian trajectory prediction and crowd simulation, mapping its intellectual evolution and interdisciplinary structure. Using bibliometric data from the Web of Science Core Collection, we employ SciExplorer and Bibliometrix to identify major trends, influential contributors, and emerging frontiers. Results reveal a strong convergence between artificial intelligence, urban informatics, and crowd behavior modeling--driven by graph neural networks, transformers, and generative models. Beyond technical advances, the field increasingly informs urban mobility design, public safety planning, and digital twin development for smart cities. However, challenges remain in ensuring interpretability, inclusivity, and cross-domain transferability. By connecting methodological trajectories with urban applications, this work highlights how data-driven approaches can enrich urban governance and pave the way for adaptive, socially responsible mobility intelligence in future cities.

Abstract: We present a deep reinforcement learning framework based on Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) for safe and precise maneuvering of double-Ackermann-steering mobile robots (DASMRs). Unlike holonomic or simpler non-holonomic robots such as differential-drive robots, DASMRs face strong kinematic constraints that make classical planners brittle in cluttered environments. Our framework leverages the Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) and the CrossQ overlay to encourage maneuvering efficiency while avoiding obstacles. Simulation results with a heavy four-wheel-steering rover show that the learned policy can robustly reach up to 97% of target positions while avoiding obstacles. Our framework does not rely on handcrafted trajectories or expert demonstrations.

Abstract: Over the past decade, an ecosystem of measures has emerged to evaluate the social and ethical implications of AI systems, largely shaped by high-level ethics principles. These measures are developed and used in fragmented ways, without adequate attention to how they are situated in AI systems. In this paper, we examine how existing measures used in the computing literature map to AI system components, attributes, hazards, and harms. Our analysis draws on a scoping review resulting in nearly 800 measures corresponding to 11 AI ethics principles. We find that most measures focus on four principles - fairness, transparency, privacy, and trust - and primarily assess model or output system components. Few measures account for interactions across system elements, and only a narrow set of hazards is typically considered for each harm type. Many measures are disconnected from where harm is experienced and lack guidance for setting meaningful thresholds. These patterns reveal how current evaluation practices remain fragmented, measuring in pieces rather than capturing how harms emerge across systems. Framing measures with respect to system attributes, hazards, and harms can strengthen regulatory oversight, support actionable practices in industry, and ground future research in systems-level understanding.

<title>Ortho-Fuse: Orthomosaic Generation for Sparse High-Resolution Crop Health Maps Through Intermediate Optical Flow Estimation</title>

Abstract: AI-driven crop health mapping systems offer substantial advantages over conventional monitoring approaches through accelerated data acquisition and cost reduction. However, widespread farmer adoption remains constrained by technical limitations in orthomosaic generation from sparse aerial imagery datasets. Traditional photogrammetric reconstruction requires 70-80\% inter-image overlap to establish sufficient feature correspondences for accurate geometric registration. AI-driven systems operating under resource-constrained conditions cannot consistently achieve these overlap thresholds, resulting in degraded reconstruction quality that undermines user confidence in autonomous monitoring technologies. In this paper, we present Ortho-Fuse, an optical flow-based framework that enables the generation of a reliable orthomosaic with reduced overlap requirements. Our approach employs intermediate flow estimation to synthesize transitional imagery between consecutive aerial frames, artificially augmenting feature correspondences for improved geometric reconstruction. Experimental validation demonstrates a 20\% reduction in minimum overlap requirements. We further analyze adoption barriers in precision agriculture to identify pathways for enhanced integration of AI-driven monitoring systems.

Abstract: Coordinating heterogeneous robot fleets to achieve multiple goals is challenging in multi-robot systems. We introduce an open-source and extensible framework for centralized multi-robot task planning and scheduling that leverages LLMs to enable fleets of heterogeneous robots to accomplish multiple tasks. RobotFleet provides abstractions for planning, scheduling, and execution across robots deployed as containerized services to simplify fleet scaling and management. The framework maintains a shared declarative world state and two-way communication for task execution and replanning. By modularizing each layer of the autonomy stack and using LLMs for open-world reasoning, RobotFleet lowers the barrier to building scalable multi-robot systems. The code can be found here: https://github.com/therohangupta/robot-fleet.

<title>Identifying bias in CNN image classification using image scrambling and transforms</title>

Abstract: CNNs are now prevalent as the primary choice for most machine vision problems due to their superior rate of classification and the availability of user-friendly libraries. These networks effortlessly identify and select features in a non-intuitive data-driven manner, making it difficult to determine which features were most influential. That leads to a ``black box", where users cannot know how the image data are analyzed but rely on empirical results. Therefore the decision-making process can be biased by background information that is difficult to detect. Here we discuss examples of such hidden biases and propose techniques for identifying them, methods to distinguish between contextual information and background noise, and explore whether CNNs learn from irrelevant features. One effective approach to identify dataset bias is to classify blank background parts of the images. However, in some situations a blank background in the images is not available, making it more difficult to separate the foreground information from the blank background. Such parts of the image can also be considered contextual learning, not necessarily bias. To overcome this, we propose two approaches that were tested on six different datasets, including natural, synthetic, and hybrid datasets. The first method involves dividing images into smaller, non-overlapping tiles of various sizes, which are then shuffled randomly, making classification more challenging. The second method involves the application of several image transforms, including Fourier, Wavelet transforms, and Median filter, and their combinations. These transforms help recover background noise information used by CNN to classify images. Results indicate that this method can effectively distinguish between contextual information and background noise, and alert on the presence of background noise even without the need to use background information.

Abstract: The ability of language models in RAG systems to selectively refuse to answer based on flawed context is critical for safety, yet remains a significant failure point. Our large-scale study reveals that even frontier models struggle in this setting, with refusal accuracy dropping below 50% on multi-document tasks, while exhibiting either dangerous overconfidence or overcaution. Static benchmarks fail to reliably evaluate this capability, as models exploit dataset-specific artifacts and memorize test instances. We introduce RefusalBench, a generative methodology that programmatically creates diagnostic test cases through controlled linguistic perturbation. Our framework employs 176 distinct perturbation strategies across six categories of informational uncertainty and three intensity levels. Evaluation of over 30 models uncovers systematic failure patterns: refusal comprises separable detection and categorization skills, and neither scale nor extended reasoning improves performance. We find that selective refusal is a trainable, alignment-sensitive capability, offering a clear path for improvement. We release two benchmarks -- RefusalBench-NQ (single document) and RefusalBench-GaRAGe (multi-document) -- and our complete generation framework to enable continued, dynamic evaluation of this critical capability.

Abstract: Large Language Models store extensive factual knowledge acquired during large-scale pre-training. However, this knowledge is inherently static, reflecting only the state of the world at the time of training. Knowledge editing has emerged as a promising solution for updating outdated or incorrect facts without full retraining. However, most existing locate-and-edit methods primarily focus on token-level likelihood optimization without addressing semantic coherence. Our analysis reveals that such edited knowledge is often encoded as isolated residual streams in the model's latent space, distinct from pre-existing knowledge and bypassing natural reasoning process. To address this, we propose \textsc{Steam}, a semantic-level knowledge editing framework that enhances integration of updated knowledge into the model's knowledge structure. \textsc{Steam} first identifies target representations as semantic anchors for the updated factual association, then guides the internal representation of the edited fact towards these anchors through an alignment loss during optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that \textsc{Steam} improves model's ability to reason with edited knowledge and enhances semantic coherence, underscoring the importance of latent-space alignment for reliable and coherent knowledge editing. The code is available at https://github.com/GY-Jeong/STEAM.

<title>Controllable Graph Generation with Diffusion Models via Inference-Time Tree Search Guidance</title>

Abstract: Graph generation is a fundamental problem in graph learning with broad applications across Web-scale systems, knowledge graphs, and scientific domains such as drug and material discovery. Recent approaches leverage diffusion models for step-by-step generation, yet unconditional diffusion offers little control over desired properties, often leading to unstable quality and difficulty in incorporating new objectives. Inference-time guidance methods mitigate these issues by adjusting the sampling process without retraining, but they remain inherently local, heuristic, and limited in controllability. To overcome these limitations, we propose TreeDiff, a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) guided dual-space diffusion framework for controllable graph generation. TreeDiff is a plug-and-play inference-time method that expands the search space while keeping computation tractable. Specifically, TreeDiff introduces three key designs to make it practical and scalable: (1) a macro-step expansion strategy that groups multiple denoising updates into a single transition, reducing tree depth and enabling long-horizon exploration; (2) a dual-space denoising mechanism that couples efficient latent-space denoising with lightweight discrete correction in graph space, ensuring both scalability and structural fidelity; and (3) a dual-space verifier that predicts long-term rewards from partially denoised graphs, enabling early value estimation and removing the need for full rollouts. Extensive experiments on 2D and 3D molecular generation benchmarks, under both unconditional and conditional settings, demonstrate that TreeDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, TreeDiff exhibits favorable inference-time scaling: it continues to improve with additional computation, while existing inference-time methods plateau early under limited resources.

Abstract: Gait recognition, a fundamental biometric technology, leverages unique walking patterns for individual identification, typically using 2D representations such as silhouettes or skeletons. However, these methods often struggle with viewpoint variations, occlusions, and noise. Multi-modal approaches that incorporate 3D body shape information offer improved robustness but are computationally expensive, limiting their feasibility for real-time applications. To address these challenges, we introduce Mesh-Gait, a novel end-to-end multi-modal gait recognition framework that directly reconstructs 3D representations from 2D silhouettes, effectively combining the strengths of both modalities. Compared to existing methods, directly learning 3D features from 3D joints or meshes is complex and difficult to fuse with silhouette-based gait features. To overcome this, Mesh-Gait reconstructs 3D heatmaps as an intermediate representation, enabling the model to effectively capture 3D geometric information while maintaining simplicity and computational efficiency. During training, the intermediate 3D heatmaps are gradually reconstructed and become increasingly accurate under supervised learning, where the loss is calculated between the reconstructed 3D joints, virtual markers, and 3D meshes and their corresponding ground truth, ensuring precise spatial alignment and consistent 3D structure. Mesh-Gait extracts discriminative features from both silhouettes and reconstructed 3D heatmaps in a computationally efficient manner. This design enables the model to capture spatial and structural gait characteristics while avoiding the heavy overhead of direct 3D reconstruction from RGB videos, allowing the network to focus on motion dynamics rather than irrelevant visual details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mesh-Gait achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. The code will be released upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Evaluating long-form clinical question answering (QA) systems is resource-intensive and challenging: accurate judgments require medical expertise and achieving consistent human judgments over long-form text is difficult. We introduce LongQAEval, an evaluation framework and set of evaluation recommendations for limited-resource and high-expertise settings. Based on physician annotations of 300 real patient questions answered by physicians and LLMs, we compare coarse answer-level versus fine-grained sentence-level evaluation over the dimensions of correctness, relevance, and safety. We find that inter-annotator agreement (IAA) varies by dimension: fine-grained annotation improves agreement on correctness, coarse improves agreement on relevance, and judgments on safety remain inconsistent. Additionally, annotating only a small subset of sentences can provide reliability comparable to coarse annotations, reducing cost and effort.

Abstract: Gait recognition is an important biometric for human identification at a distance, particularly under low-resolution or unconstrained environments. Current works typically focus on either 2D representations (e.g., silhouettes and skeletons) or 3D representations (e.g., meshes and SMPLs), but relying on a single modality often fails to capture the full geometric and dynamic complexity of human walking patterns. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal and multi-task framework that combines 2D temporal silhouettes with 3D SMPL features for robust gait analysis. Beyond identification, we introduce a multitask learning strategy that jointly performs gait recognition and human attribute estimation, including age, body mass index (BMI), and gender. A unified transformer is employed to effectively fuse multi-modal gait features and better learn attribute-related representations, while preserving discriminative identity cues. Extensive experiments on the large-scale BRIAR datasets, collected under challenging conditions such as long-range distances (up to 1 km) and extreme pitch angles (up to 50{\deg}), demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in gait recognition and provides accurate human attribute estimation. These results highlight the promise of multi-modal and multitask learning for advancing gait-based human understanding in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often fail in fine-grained visual question answering, producing hallucinations about object identities, positions, and relations because textual queries are not explicitly anchored to visual referents. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) alleviates some errors, but it fails to align with human-like processing at both the retrieval and augmentation levels. Specifically, it focuses only on global-level image information but lacks local detail and limits reasoning about fine-grained interactions. To overcome this limitation, we present Human-Like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HuLiRAG), a framework that stages multimodal reasoning as a ``what--where--reweight'' cascade. Queries are first anchored to candidate referents via open-vocabulary detection (what), then spatially resolved with SAM-derived masks to recover fine-grained precision (where), and adaptively prioritized through the trade-off between local and global alignment (reweight). Mask-guided fine-tuning further injects spatial evidence into the generation process, transforming grounding from a passive bias into an explicit constraint on answer formulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this human-like cascade improves grounding fidelity and factual consistency while reducing hallucinations, advancing multimodal question answering toward trustworthy reasoning.

Abstract: Deep models have driven significant advances in click-through rate (CTR) prediction. While vertical scaling via layer stacking improves model expressiveness, the layer-by-layer sequential computation poses challenges to efficient scaling. Conversely, horizontal scaling through Mixture of Experts (MoE) achieves efficient scaling by activating a small subset of experts in parallel, but flat MoE layers may struggle to capture the hierarchical structure inherent in recommendation tasks. To push the Return-On-Investment (ROI) boundary, we explore the complementary strengths of both directions and propose HiLoMoE, a hierarchical LoRA MoE framework that enables holistic scaling in a parameter-efficient manner. Specifically, HiLoMoE employs lightweight rank-1 experts for parameter-efficient horizontal scaling, and stacks multiple MoE layers with hierarchical routing to enable combinatorially diverse expert compositions. Unlike conventional stacking, HiLoMoE routes based on prior layer scores rather than outputs, allowing all layers to execute in parallel. A principled three-stage training framework ensures stable optimization and expert diversity. Experiments on four public datasets show that HiLoMoE achieving better performance-efficiency tradeoff, achieving an average AUC improvement of 0.20\% in AUC and 18.5\% reduction in FLOPs compared to the non-MoE baseline.

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in aging populations, posing a significant and escalating burden on global healthcare systems. While Multi-Tusk Learning (MTL) has emerged as a powerful computational paradigm for modeling longitudinal AD data, existing frameworks do not account for the time-varying nature of feature correlations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel MTL framework, named Feature Similarity Laplacian graph Multi-Task Learning (MTL-FSL). Our framework introduces a novel Feature Similarity Laplacian (FSL) penalty that explicitly models the time-varying relationships between features. By simultaneously considering temporal smoothness among tasks and the dynamic correlations among features, our model enhances both predictive accuracy and biological interpretability. To solve the non-smooth optimization problem arising from our proposed penalty terms, we adopt the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. Experiments conducted on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our proposed MTL-FSL framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming various baseline methods. The implementation source can be found at https://github.com/huatxxx/MTL-FSL.

<title>Do Audio LLMs Really LISTEN, or Just Transcribe? Measuring Lexical vs. Acoustic Emotion Cues Reliance</title>

Abstract: Understanding emotion from speech requires sensitivity to both lexical and acoustic cues. However, it remains unclear whether large audio language models (LALMs) genuinely process acoustic information or rely primarily on lexical content. We present LISTEN (Lexical vs. Acoustic Speech Test for Emotion in Narratives), a controlled benchmark designed to disentangle lexical reliance from acoustic sensitivity in emotion understanding. Across evaluations of six state-of-the-art LALMs, we observe a consistent lexical dominance. Models predict "neutral" when lexical cues are neutral or absent, show limited gains under cue alignment, and fail to classify distinct emotions under cue conflict. In paralinguistic settings, performance approaches chance. These results indicate that current LALMs largely "transcribe" rather than "listen," relying heavily on lexical semantics while underutilizing acoustic cues. LISTEN offers a principled framework for assessing emotion understanding in multimodal models.

Abstract: We analyze a reversed-supervision strategy that searches over labelings of a large unlabeled set \(B\) to minimize error on a small labeled set \(A\). The search space is \(2^n\), and the resulting complexity remains exponential even under large constant-factor speedups (e.g., quantum or massively parallel hardware). Consequently, arbitrarily fast -- but not exponentially faster -- computation does not obviate the need for informative labels or priors. In practice, the machine learning pipeline still requires an initial human contribution: specifying the objective, defining classes, and providing a seed set of representative annotations that inject inductive bias and align models with task semantics. Synthetic labels from generative AI can partially substitute provided their quality is human-grade and anchored by a human-specified objective, seed supervision, and validation. In this view, generative models function as \emph{label amplifiers}, leveraging small human-curated cores via active, semi-supervised, and self-training loops, while humans retain oversight for calibration, drift detection, and failure auditing. Thus, extreme computational speed reduces wall-clock time but not the fundamental supervision needs of learning; initial human (or human-grade) input remains necessary to ground the system in the intended task.

Abstract: Simulators of animal movements play a valuable role in studying behavior. Advances in imitation learning for robotics have expanded possibilities for reproducing human and animal movements. A key challenge for realistic multi-animal simulation in biology is bridging the gap between unknown real-world transition models and their simulated counterparts. Because locomotion dynamics are seldom known, relying solely on mathematical models is insufficient; constructing a simulator that both reproduces real trajectories and supports reward-driven optimization remains an open problem. We introduce a data-driven simulator for multi-animal behavior based on deep reinforcement learning and counterfactual simulation. We address the ill-posed nature of the problem caused by high degrees of freedom in locomotion by estimating movement variables of an incomplete transition model as actions within an RL framework. We also employ a distance-based pseudo-reward to align and compare states between cyber and physical spaces. Validated on artificial agents, flies, newts, and silkmoth, our approach achieves higher reproducibility of species-specific behaviors and improved reward acquisition compared with standard imitation and RL methods. Moreover, it enables counterfactual behavior prediction in novel experimental settings and supports multi-individual modeling for flexible what-if trajectory generation, suggesting its potential to simulate and elucidate complex multi-animal behaviors.

Abstract: Digital communication has become the cornerstone of modern interaction, enabling rapid, accessible, and interactive exchanges. However, individuals with lower academic literacy often face significant barriers, exacerbating the "digital divide". In this work, we introduce a novel, universal ideographic metalanguage designed as an innovative communication framework that transcends academic, linguistic, and cultural boundaries. Our approach leverages principles of Neuro-symbolic AI, combining neural-based large language models (LLMs) enriched with world knowledge and symbolic knowledge heuristics grounded in the linguistic theory of Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM). This enables the semantic decomposition of complex ideas into simpler, atomic concepts. Adopting a human-centric, collaborative methodology, we engaged over 200 semi-literate participants in defining the problem, selecting ideographs, and validating the system. With over 80\% semantic comprehensibility, an accessible learning curve, and universal adaptability, our system effectively serves underprivileged populations with limited formal education.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MASs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for automated code generation, demonstrating impressive performance on established benchmarks by decomposing complex coding tasks across specialized agents with different roles. Despite their prosperous development and adoption, their robustness remains pressingly under-explored, raising critical concerns for real-world deployment. This paper presents the first comprehensive study examining the robustness of MASs for code generation through a fuzzing-based testing approach. By designing a fuzzing pipeline incorporating semantic-preserving mutation operators and a novel fitness function, we assess mainstream MASs across multiple datasets and LLMs. Our findings reveal substantial robustness flaws of various popular MASs: they fail to solve 7.9%-83.3% of problems they initially resolved successfully after applying the semantic-preserving mutations. Through comprehensive failure analysis, we identify a common yet largely overlooked cause of the robustness issue: miscommunications between planning and coding agents, where plans lack sufficient detail and coding agents misinterpret intricate logic, aligning with the challenges inherent in a multi-stage information transformation process. Accordingly, we also propose a repairing method that encompasses multi-prompt generation and introduces a new monitor agent to address this issue. Evaluation shows that our repairing method effectively enhances the robustness of MASs by solving 40.0%-88.9% of identified failures. Our work uncovers critical robustness flaws in MASs and provides effective mitigation strategies, contributing essential insights for developing more reliable MASs for code generation.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation annotation suffers from inter-rater variability (IRV) due to differences in annotators' expertise and the inherent blurriness of medical images. Standard approaches that simply average expert labels are flawed, as they discard the valuable clinical uncertainty revealed in disagreements. We introduce a fundamentally new approach with our group decision simulation framework, which works by mimicking the collaborative decision-making process of a clinical panel. Under this framework, an Expert Signature Generator (ESG) learns to represent individual annotator styles in a unique latent space. A Simulated Consultation Module (SCM) then intelligently generates the final segmentation by sampling from this space. This method achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging CBCT and MRI datasets (92.11% and 90.72% Dice scores). By treating expert disagreement as a useful signal instead of noise, our work provides a clear path toward more robust and trustworthy AI systems for healthcare.

Abstract: Modern Internet of Things (IoT) systems generate massive, heterogeneous multivariate time series data. Accurate Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) of such data is critical for numerous applications. However, existing methods almost universally employ a shared embedding layer that processes all channels identically, creating a representational bottleneck that obscures valuable channel-specific information. To address this challenge, we introduce a Shared-Auxiliary Embedding (SAE) framework that decomposes the embedding into a shared base component capturing common patterns and channel-specific auxiliary components modeling unique deviations. Within this decomposition, we \rev{empirically observe} that the auxiliary components tend to exhibit low-rank and clustering characteristics, a structural pattern that is significantly less apparent when using purely independent embeddings. Consequently, we design LightSAE, a parameter-efficient embedding module that operationalizes these observed characteristics through low-rank factorization and a shared, gated component pool. Extensive experiments across 9 IoT-related datasets and 4 backbone architectures demonstrate LightSAE's effectiveness, achieving MSE improvements of up to 22.8\% with only 4.0\% parameter increase.

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly constrained by memory and latency bottlenecks, motivating the need for quantization techniques that flexibly balance accuracy and efficiency. Recent work has introduced multi-precision models, which enable inference at multiple precisions within a single model depending on runtime constraints. To support such flexibility, quantized weights are often stored as bit-planes, where hardware efficiency improves when the compute operates directly at the bit-plane level and activates only the precision required by each request. In this work, we present AnyBCQ, a hardware-friendly multi-precision extension of Binary-Coded Quantization (BCQ) that supports direct bit-plane operations. By representing weights as binary bit-planes with corresponding scale factors, AnyBCQ enables bit-plane-level computation and maps naturally to accelerator-friendly, bit-parallel arithmetic. Our progressive precision expansion mechanism incrementally refines scaling factors while reusing previously assigned binary codes, yielding monotonic improvements in accuracy as additional bits are enabled. We further co-design a specialized kernel that exploits the BCQ structure to support dynamic per-request precision selection with negligible overhead. Experiments on recent LLMs demonstrate that AnyBCQ significantly narrows the accuracy drop in the low-bit regime (e.g. 2-bit), remains competitive at higher precision, and achieves throughput gains of up to 3.0x over half precision and 1.2x over state-of-the-art multi-precision methods. By aligning algorithmic flexibility with hardware efficiency, AnyBCQ provides a practical foundation for multi-precision LLM deployment across diverse service-level objectives.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in automatic machine learning research agents. Among them, agents capable of autonomously proposing ideas and conducting machine learning experiments are particularly promising, as they maximize research automation and accelerate scientific progress by iteratively refining ideas based on experimental results. However, comprehensively evaluating such agents remains challenging. Existing benchmarks tend to overemphasize engineering aspects while neglecting academic rigor, creating barriers that obscure a clear assessment of an agent's scientific capabilities in machine learning research. They also suffer from limited task diversity, an overemphasis on application-oriented tasks over fundamental research problems, and limited scalability to realistic research settings. To address these limitations, we introduce FML-bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate automatic machine learning research agents on 8 diverse and fundamental machine learning research problems. It reduces coding burden, emphasizes fundamental problems rather than specific use cases, offers high task diversity, and is extensible to real-world machine learning GitHub repositories. Furthermore, we present a unified evaluation framework with five complementary metrics, designed to comprehensively assess agent performance on our benchmark. We evaluate state-of-the-art automatic research agents on FML-bench, and find that agents employing broad research exploration strategies outperform those focusing on narrow but deep exploration. These findings suggest that emphasizing the breadth of exploration may lead to more effective research outcomes than focusing solely on incremental refinement. Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/qrzou/FML-bench.

Abstract: Medical order extraction is essential for structuring actionable clinical information, supporting decision-making, and enabling downstream applications such as documentation and workflow automation. Orders may be embedded in diverse sources, including electronic health records, discharge summaries, and multi-turn doctor-patient dialogues, and can span categories such as medications, laboratory tests, imaging studies, and follow-up actions. The MEDIQA-OE 2025 shared task focuses on extracting structured medical orders from extended conversational transcripts, requiring the identification of order type, description, reason, and provenance. We present the MasonNLP submission, which ranked 5th among 17 participating teams with 105 total submissions. Our approach uses a general-purpose, instruction-tuned LLaMA-4 17B model without domain-specific fine-tuning, guided by a single in-context example. This few-shot configuration achieved an average F1 score of 37.76, with notable improvements in reason and provenance accuracy. These results demonstrate that large, non-domain-specific LLMs, when paired with effective prompt engineering, can serve as strong, scalable baselines for specialized clinical NLP tasks.

Abstract: Designing protein binders targeting specific sites, which requires to generate realistic and functional interaction patterns, is a fundamental challenge in drug discovery. Current structure-based generative models are limited in generating nterfaces with sufficient rationality and interpretability. In this paper, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion for Aligned interface (RADiAnce), a new framework that leverages known interfaces to guide the design of novel binders. By unifying retrieval and generation in a shared contrastive latent space, our model efficiently identifies relevant interfaces for a given binding site and seamlessly integrates them through a conditional latent diffusion generator, enabling cross-domain interface transfer. Extensive exeriments show that RADiAnce significantly outperforms baseline models across multiple metrics, including binding affinity and recovery of geometries and interactions. Additional experimental results validate cross-domain generalization, demonstrating that retrieving interfaces from diverse domains, such as peptides, antibodies, and protein fragments, enhances the generation performance of binders for other domains. Our work establishes a new paradigm for protein binder design that successfully bridges retrieval-based knowledge and generative AI, opening new possibilities for drug discovery.

Abstract: Diffusion LLMs have attracted growing interest, with plenty of recent work emphasizing their great potential in various downstream tasks; yet the long-context behavior of diffusion LLMs remains largely uncharted. We present a case study of post-training techniques for extending the context window of diffusion LLMs (i.e., LLaDA) without retraining from scratch. We show that a simple modification to the standard Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) extension effectively accommodates the probabilistic modeling inherent in the diffusion process, enabling stable scaling to longer context ranges. We further compare masking strategies used during post-training and analyze their impact on optimization stability and long-range recall. Instantiating these insights, we introduce UltraLLaDA, a diffusion LLM with a 128K-token context window that, in our empirical evaluation on long-context tasks, significantly outperforms training-free baselines. Our experimental results highlight the special positional extension as a key lever for scaling diffusion LLMs to extended contexts and offer practical guidance for practitioners seeking 128K-scale context via efficient post-training.

Abstract: Open-source large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable dominance over proprietary LLMs in resolving neural processing tasks, thanks to the collaborative and sharing nature. Although full access to source codes, model parameters, and training data lays the groundwork for transparency, we argue that such a full-access manner is vulnerable to stego attacks, and their ill-effects are not fully understood. In this paper, we conduct a systematic formalization for stego attacks on open-source LLMs by enumerating all possible threat models associated with adversary objectives, knowledge, and capabilities. Therein, the threat posed by adversaries with internal knowledge, who inject payloads and triggers during the model sharing phase, is of practical interest. We go even further and propose the first stego attack on open-source LLMs, dubbed SASER, which wields impacts through identifying targeted parameters, embedding payloads, injecting triggers, and executing payloads sequentially. Particularly, SASER enhances the attack robustness against quantization-based local deployment by de-quantizing the embedded payloads. In addition, to achieve stealthiness, SASER devises the performance-aware importance metric to identify targeted parameters with the least degradation of model performance. Extensive experiments on LlaMA2-7B and ChatGLM3-6B, without quantization, show that the stealth rate of SASER outperforms existing stego attacks (for general DNNs) by up to 98.1%, while achieving the same attack success rate (ASR) of 100%. More importantly, SASER improves ASR on quantized models from 0 to 100% in all settings. We appeal for investigations on countermeasures against SASER in view of the significant attack effectiveness.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) integrate visual knowledge with the analytical capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through supervised visual instruction tuning, using image-question-answer triplets. However, the potential of VLMs trained without supervised instruction remains largely unexplored. This study validates that VLMs possess inherent self-refinement capabilities, enabling them to generate high-quality supervised data without external inputs and thereby learn autonomously. Specifically, to stimulate the self-refinement ability of VLMs, we propose a self-refinement framework based on a Triangular Consistency principle: within the image-query-answer triangle, any masked elements should be consistently and accurately reconstructed. The framework involves three steps: (1) We enable the instruction generation ability of VLMs by adding multi-task instruction tuning like image$\rightarrow$question-answer or image-answer$\rightarrow$question. (2) We generate image-query-answer triplets from unlabeled images and use the Triangular Consistency principle for filtering. (3) The model is further updated using the filtered synthetic data. To investigate the underlying mechanisms behind this self-refinement capability, we conduct a theoretical analysis from a causal perspective. Using the widely recognized LLaVA-1.5 as our baseline, our experiments reveal that the model can autonomously achieve consistent, though deliberately modest, improvements across multiple benchmarks without any external supervision, such as human annotations or environmental feedback. We expect that the insights of this study on the self-refinement ability of VLMs can inspire future research on the learning mechanism of VLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/dengyl20/SRF-LLaVA-1.5.

Abstract: A critical challenge in contemporary sports science lies in filling the gap between group-level insights derived from controlled hypothesis-driven experiments and the real-world need for personalized coaching tailored to individual athletes' unique movement patterns. This study developed a Personalized Motion Guidance Framework (PMGF) to enhance athletic performance by generating individualized motion-refinement guides using generative artificial intelligence techniques. PMGF leverages a vertical autoencoder to encode motion sequences into athlete-specific latent representations, which can then be directly manipulated to generate meaningful guidance motions. Two manipulation strategies were explored: (1) smooth interpolation between the learner's motion and a target (e.g., expert) motion to facilitate observational learning, and (2) shifting the motion pattern in an optimal direction in the latent space using a local optimization technique. The results of the validation experiment with data from 51 baseball pitchers revealed that (1) PMGF successfully generated smooth transitions in motion patterns between individuals across all 1,275 pitcher pairs, and (2) the features significantly altered through PMGF manipulations reflected known performance-enhancing characteristics, such as increased stride length and knee extension associated with higher ball velocity, indicating that PMGF induces biomechanically plausible improvements. We propose a future extension called general-PMGF to enhance the applicability of this framework. This extension incorporates bodily, environmental, and task constraints into the generation process, aiming to provide more realistic and versatile guidance across diverse sports contexts.

Abstract: Motion planning in complex scenarios is a core challenge in autonomous driving. Conventional methods apply predefined rules or learn from driving data to generate trajectories, while recent approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) for decision-making. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs truly capture human driving logic. We propose Align2Act, a motion planning framework that transforms instruction-tuned LLMs into interpretable planners aligned with human behavior. We derive structured driving instructions based on human reasoning patterns (e.g., anticipate hazards, yield at intersections) and traffic rules (e.g., stop at red lights, maintain lane boundaries). Our Align2ActChain module guides step-by-step reasoning to produce both an interpretable rationale and a safe trajectory. By fine-tuning LLaMA-2-7B with LoRA on one million scenarios from the nuPlan dataset, our method achieves an open-loop score of 85.17 and closed-loop scores of 70.31 (non-reactive) and 66.96 (reactive) on Test14-random. Unlike prior work focused on synthetic or open-loop settings, we demonstrate improved planning quality and human-likeness on the real-world nuPlan closed-loop benchmark. Ablation studies confirm that structured reasoning significantly improves performance over baseline LLM planners.

Abstract: Universal sound separation faces a fundamental misalignment: models optimized for low-level signal metrics often produce semantically contaminated outputs, failing to suppress perceptually salient interference from acoustically similar sources. To bridge this gap, we introduce MARS-Sep, a reinforcement learning framework that reformulates separation as decision making. Instead of simply regressing ground-truth masks, MARS-Sep learns a factorized Beta mask policy that is optimized by a clipped trust-region surrogate with entropy regularization and group-relative advantage normalization. Concretely, we sample masks from a frozen old policy, reconstruct waveforms, and update the current policy using clipped importance ratios-yielding substantially more stable and sample-efficient learning. Multimodal rewards, derived from an audio-text-vision encoder, directly incentivize semantic consistency with query prompts. We further propose a progressive alignment scheme to fine-tune this encoder, boosting its cross-modal discriminability and improving reward faithfulness. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate consistent gains in Text-, Audio-, and Image-Queried separation, with notable improvements in signal metrics and semantic quality. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MARS-Sep. Sound separation samples are available at https://mars-sep.github.io/.

Abstract: Influence estimation methods promise to explain and debug machine learning by estimating the impact of individual samples on the final model. Yet, existing methods collapse under training randomness: the same example may appear critical in one run and irrelevant in the next. Such instability undermines their use in data curation or cleanup since it is unclear if we indeed deleted/kept the correct datapoints. To overcome this, we introduce *f-influence* -- a new influence estimation framework grounded in hypothesis testing that explicitly accounts for training randomness, and establish desirable properties that make it suitable for reliable influence estimation. We also design a highly efficient algorithm **f**-**IN**fluence **E**stimation (**f-INE**) that computes f-influence **in a single training run**. Finally, we scale up f-INE to estimate influence of instruction tuning data on Llama-3.1-8B and show it can reliably detect poisoned samples that steer model opinions, demonstrating its utility for data cleanup and attributing model behavior.

Abstract: Energy-efficient and high-performance motor control remains a critical challenge in robotics, particularly for high-dimensional continuous control tasks with limited onboard resources. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable results, its computational demands and energy consumption limit deployment in resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces a novel framework combining population-coded Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with DRL to address these challenges. Our approach leverages the event-driven, asynchronous computation of SNNs alongside the robust policy optimization capabilities of DRL, achieving a balance between energy efficiency and control performance. Central to this framework is the Population-coded Spiking Actor Network (PopSAN), which encodes high-dimensional observations into neuronal population activities and enables optimal policy learning through gradient-based updates. We evaluate our method on the Isaac Gym platform using the PixMC benchmark with complex robotic manipulation tasks. Experimental results on the Franka robotic arm demonstrate that our approach achieves energy savings of up to 96.10% compared to traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) while maintaining comparable control performance. The trained SNN policies exhibit robust finger position tracking with minimal deviation from commanded trajectories and stable target height maintenance during pick-and-place operations. These results position population-coded SNNs as a promising solution for energy-efficient, high-performance robotic control in resource-constrained applications, paving the way for scalable deployment in real-world robotics systems.

<title>ECO: Enhanced Code Optimization via Performance-Aware Prompting for Code-LLMs</title>

Abstract: Code runtime optimization-the task of rewriting a given code to a faster one-remains challenging, as it requires reasoning about performance trade-offs involving algorithmic and structural choices. Recent approaches employ code-LLMs with slow-fast code pairs provided as optimization guidance, but such pair-based methods obscure the causal factors of performance gains and often lead to superficial pattern imitation rather than genuine performance reasoning. We introduce ECO, a performance-aware prompting framework for code optimization. ECO first distills runtime optimization instructions (ROIs) from reference slow-fast code pairs; Each ROI describes root causes of inefficiency and the rationales that drive performance improvements. For a given input code, ECO in parallel employs (i) a symbolic advisor to produce a bottleneck diagnosis tailored to the code, and (ii) an ROI retriever to return related ROIs. These two outputs are then composed into a performance-aware prompt, providing actionable guidance for code-LLMs. ECO's prompts are model-agnostic, require no fine-tuning, and can be easily prepended to any code-LLM prompt. Our empirical studies highlight that ECO prompting significantly improves code-LLMs' ability to generate efficient code, achieving speedups of up to 7.81x while minimizing correctness loss.

Abstract: Current benchmarks are inadequate for evaluating progress in reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs).Despite recent benchmark gains reported for RL, we find that training on these benchmarks' training sets achieves nearly the same performance as training directly on the test sets, suggesting that the benchmarks cannot reliably separate further progress.To study this phenomenon, we introduce a diagnostic suite and the Oracle Performance Gap (OPG) metric that quantifies the performance difference between training on the train split versus the test split of a benchmark. We further analyze this phenomenon with stress tests and find that, despite strong benchmark scores, existing RL methods struggle to generalize across distribution shifts, varying levels of difficulty, and counterfactual scenarios: shortcomings that current benchmarks fail to reveal.We conclude that current benchmarks are insufficient for evaluating generalization and propose three core principles for designing more faithful benchmarks: sufficient difficulty, balanced evaluation, and distributional robustness.

Abstract: We derive a novel PAC-Bayesian generalization bound for reinforcement learning that explicitly accounts for Markov dependencies in the data, through the chain's mixing time. This contributes to overcoming challenges in obtaining generalization guarantees for reinforcement learning, where the sequential nature of data breaks the independence assumptions underlying classical bounds. Our bound provides non-vacuous certificates for modern off-policy algorithms like Soft Actor-Critic. We demonstrate the bound's practical utility through PB-SAC, a novel algorithm that optimizes the bound during training to guide exploration. Experiments across continuous control tasks show that our approach provides meaningful confidence certificates while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) are rare but destructive hazards in high mountain regions, yet predictive research is hindered by fragmented and unimodal data. Most prior efforts emphasize post-event mapping, whereas forecasting requires harmonized datasets that combine visual indicators with physical precursors. We present GLOFNet, a multimodal dataset for GLOF monitoring and prediction, focused on the Shisper Glacier in the Karakoram. It integrates three complementary sources: Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery for spatial monitoring, NASA ITS_LIVE velocity products for glacier kinematics, and MODIS Land Surface Temperature records spanning over two decades. Preprocessing included cloud masking, quality filtering, normalization, temporal interpolation, augmentation, and cyclical encoding, followed by harmonization across modalities. Exploratory analysis reveals seasonal glacier velocity cycles, long-term warming of ~0.8 K per decade, and spatial heterogeneity in cryospheric conditions. The resulting dataset, GLOFNet, is publicly available to support future research in glacial hazard prediction. By addressing challenges such as class imbalance, cloud contamination, and coarse resolution, GLOFNet provides a structured foundation for benchmarking multimodal deep learning approaches to rare hazard prediction.

Abstract: Cross-attention transformers and other multimodal vision-language models excel at grounding and generation; however, their extensive, full-precision backbones make it challenging to deploy them on edge devices. Memory-augmented architectures enhance the utilization of past context; however, most works rarely pair them with aggressive edge-oriented quantization. We introduce BitMar, a quantized multimodal transformer that proposes an external human-like episodic memory for effective image-text generation on hardware with limited resources. BitMar utilizes 1.58-bit encoders, one for text (BitNet-style) and one for vision (DiNOv2-based), to create compact embeddings that are combined and used to query a fixed-size key-value episodic memory. During vector retrieval, the BitNet decoder applies per-layer conditioning, which increases the contextual relevance of generated content. The decoder also employs attention sinks with a sliding-window mechanism to process long or streaming inputs under tight memory budgets. The combination of per-layer conditioning and sliding-window attention achieves a strong quality-speed trade-off, delivering competitive captioning and multimodal understanding at low latency with a small model footprint. These characteristics make BitMar well-suited for edge deployment.

Abstract: In the algorithmic (Kolmogorov) view, agents are programs that track and compress sensory streams using generative programs. We propose a framework where the relevant structural prior is simplicity (Solomonoff) understood as \emph{compositional symmetry}: natural streams are well described by (local) actions of finite-parameter Lie pseudogroups on geometrically and topologically complex low-dimensional configuration manifolds (latent spaces). Modeling the agent as a generic neural dynamical system coupled to such streams, we show that accurate world-tracking imposes (i) \emph{structural constraints} -- equivariance of the agent's constitutive equations and readouts -- and (ii) \emph{dynamical constraints}: under static inputs, symmetry induces conserved quantities (Noether-style labels) in the agent dynamics and confines trajectories to reduced invariant manifolds; under slow drift, these manifolds move but remain low-dimensional. This yields a hierarchy of reduced manifolds aligned with the compositional factorization of the pseudogroup, providing a geometric account of the ``blessing of compositionality'' in deep models. We connect these ideas to the Spencer formalism for Lie pseudogroups and formulate a symmetry-based, self-contained version of predictive coding in which higher layers receive only \emph{coarse-grained residual transformations} (prediction-error coordinates) along symmetry directions unresolved at lower layers.

Abstract: This paper proposes a modeling framework for dynamic topic evolution based on temporal large language models. The method first uses a large language model to obtain contextual embeddings of text and then introduces a temporal decay function and an attention mechanism. These components allow the model to adjust the importance of semantic units according to time intervals and capture topic variations across different periods. The temporal representations are then mapped into a latent topic space, where a state transition matrix is applied to describe the dynamic evolution of topics. A joint optimization objective constrains both semantic modeling and temporal consistency, ensuring diversity and smoothness in topic generation. The design emphasizes the unified modeling of semantic representation and temporal evolution, which improves topic coherence and diversity while enhancing stability and interpretability over time. Experiments on real-world corpora show that the framework effectively captures the generation, expansion, and decline of topics and outperforms existing models across multiple metrics. Overall, the proposed method provides a systematic solution for understanding dynamic semantic patterns in large-scale text, enriches the research paradigm of topic modeling, and supports complex text analysis tasks in multiple domains.

Abstract: Guitar tablature transcription consists in deducing the string and the fret number on which each note should be played to reproduce the actual musical part. This assignment should lead to playable string-fret combinations throughout the entire track and, in general, preserve parsimonious motion between successive combinations. Throughout the history of guitar playing, specific chord fingerings have been developed across different musical styles that facilitate common idiomatic voicing combinations and motion between them. This paper presents a method for assigning guitar tablature notation to a given MIDI-based musical part (possibly consisting of multiple polyphonic tracks), i.e. no information about guitar-idiomatic expressional characteristics is involved (e.g. bending etc.) The current strategy is based on machine learning and requires a basic assumption about how much fingers can stretch on a fretboard; only standard 6-string guitar tuning is examined. The proposed method also examines the transcription of music pieces that was not meant to be played or could not possibly be played by a guitar (e.g. potentially a symphonic orchestra part), employing a rudimentary method for augmenting musical information and training/testing the system with artificial data. The results present interesting aspects about what the system can achieve when trained on the initial and augmented dataset, showing that the training with augmented data improves the performance even in simple, e.g. monophonic, cases. Results also indicate weaknesses and lead to useful conclusions about possible improvements.

Abstract: Building generalist robot policies that can handle diverse tasks in open-ended environments is a central challenge in robotics. To leverage knowledge from large-scale pretraining, prior work has typically built generalist policies either on top of vision-language understanding models (VLMs) or generative models. However, both semantic understanding from vision-language pretraining and visual dynamics modeling from visual-generation pretraining are crucial for embodied robots. Recent unified models of generation and understanding have demonstrated strong capabilities in both comprehension and generation through large-scale pretraining. We posit that robotic policy learning can likewise benefit from the combined strengths of understanding, planning and continuous future representation learning. Building on this insight, we introduce UniCoD, which acquires the ability to dynamically model high-dimensional visual features through pretraining on over 1M internet-scale instructional manipulation videos. Subsequently, UniCoD is fine-tuned on data collected from the robot embodiment, enabling the learning of mappings from predictive representations to action tokens. Extensive experiments show our approach consistently outperforms baseline methods in terms of 9\% and 12\% across simulation environments and real-world out-of-distribution tasks.

Abstract: Retrosynthesis is one of the domains transformed by the rise of generative models, and it is one where the problem of nonsensical or erroneous outputs (hallucinations) is particularly insidious: reliable assessment of synthetic plans is time-consuming, with automatic methods lacking. In this work, we present RetroTrim, a retrosynthesis system that successfully avoids nonsensical plans on a set of challenging drug-like targets. Compared to common baselines in the field, our system is not only the sole method that succeeds in filtering out hallucinated reactions, but it also results in the highest number of high-quality paths overall. The key insight behind RetroTrim is the combination of diverse reaction scoring strategies, based on machine learning models and existing chemical databases. We show that our scoring strategies capture different classes of hallucinations by analyzing them on a dataset of labeled retrosynthetic intermediates. To measure the performance of retrosynthesis systems, we propose a novel evaluation protocol for reactions and synthetic paths based on a structured review by expert chemists. Using this protocol, we compare systems on a set of 32 novel targets, curated to reflect recent trends in drug structures. While the insights behind our methodology are broadly applicable to retrosynthesis, our focus is on targets in the drug-like domain. By releasing our benchmark targets and the details of our evaluation protocol, we hope to inspire further research into reliable retrosynthesis.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking-head generation has advanced rapidly with diffusion-based generative models, yet producing temporally coherent videos with fine-grained motion control remains challenging. We propose DEMO, a flow-matching generative framework for audio-driven talking-portrait video synthesis that delivers disentangled, high-fidelity control of lip motion, head pose, and eye gaze. The core contribution is a motion auto-encoder that builds a structured latent space in which motion factors are independently represented and approximately orthogonalized. On this disentangled motion space, we apply optimal-transport-based flow matching with a transformer predictor to generate temporally smooth motion trajectories conditioned on audio. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that DEMO outperforms prior methods in video realism, lip-audio synchronization, and motion fidelity. These results demonstrate that combining fine-grained motion disentanglement with flow-based generative modeling provides a powerful new paradigm for controllable talking-head video synthesis.

Abstract: LLMs have advanced text-to-SQL generation, yet monolithic architectures struggle with complex reasoning and schema diversity. We propose AGENTIQL, an agent-inspired multi-expert framework that combines a reasoning agent for question decomposition, a coding agent for sub-query generation, and a refinement step for column selection. An adaptive router further balances efficiency and accuracy by selecting between our modular pipeline and a baseline parser. Several steps in the pipeline can be executed in parallel, making the framework scalable to larger workloads. Evaluated on the Spider benchmark, AGENTIQL improves execution accuracy and interpretability and achieves up to 86.07\% EX with 14B models using the Planner&amp;Executor merging strategy. The attained performance is contingent upon the efficacy of the routing mechanism, thereby narrowing the gap to GPT-4-based SOTA (89.65% EX) while using much smaller open-source LLMs. Beyond accuracy, AGENTIQL enhances transparency by exposing intermediate reasoning steps, offering a robust, scalable, and interpretable approach to semantic parsing.

Abstract: With abundant, unlabeled real faces, how can we learn robust and transferable facial representations to boost generalization across various face security tasks? We make the first attempt and propose FS-VFM, a scalable self-supervised pre-training framework, to learn fundamental representations of real face images. We introduce three learning objectives, namely 3C, that synergize masked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID), empowering FS-VFM to encode both local patterns and global semantics of real faces. Specifically, we formulate various facial masking strategies for MIM and devise a simple yet effective CRFR-P masking, which explicitly prompts the model to pursue meaningful intra-region Consistency and challenging inter-region Coherency. We present a reliable self-distillation mechanism that seamlessly couples MIM with ID to establish underlying local-to-global Correspondence. After pre-training, vanilla vision transformers (ViTs) serve as universal Vision Foundation Models for downstream Face Security tasks: cross-dataset deepfake detection, cross-domain face anti-spoofing, and unseen diffusion facial forensics. To efficiently transfer the pre-trained FS-VFM, we further propose FS-Adapter, a lightweight plug-and-play bottleneck atop the frozen backbone with a novel real-anchor contrastive objective. Extensive experiments on 11 public benchmarks demonstrate that our FS-VFM consistently generalizes better than diverse VFMs, spanning natural and facial domains, fully, weakly, and self-supervised paradigms, small, base, and large ViT scales, and even outperforms SOTA task-specific methods, while FS-Adapter offers an excellent efficiency-performance trade-off.

Abstract: Efficiently solving real-world problems with LLMs increasingly hinges on their ability to interact with dynamic web environments and autonomously acquire external information. While recent research like Search-R1 and WebDancer demonstrates strong performance in solving web tasks, they heavily rely on additional tools to convert the interactive web environment into static text content. This is in contrast to human browsing behaviors, which involve diverse interactions with the browser, such as scrolling, clicking, and typing. In this paper, we propose BrowserAgent, a more interactive agent that solves complex tasks through human-inspired browser actions. BrowserAgent operates directly on raw web pages via Playwright through a set of predefined browser actions. We adopt a two-stage training (Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT)) to improve the model's generalization abilities. Despite using significantly less training data than Search-R1, BrowserAgent achieves more competitive results across different Open-QA tasks. Additionally, we introduce an explicit memory mechanism to store key conclusions across steps, further enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities for long-horizon tasks. Notably, BrowserAgent-7B can achieve around 20\% improvement over Search-R1 on multi-hop QA tasks like HotpotQA, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle. These results indicate that BrowserAgent can serve as a more advanced framework for more interactive and scalable web agents.

Abstract: Image-Language Foundation Models (ILFM) have demonstrated remarkable success in image-text understanding/generation tasks, providing transferable multimodal representations that generalize across diverse downstream image-based tasks. The advancement of video-text research has spurred growing interest in extending image-based models to the video domain. This paradigm, known as image-to-video transfer learning, succeeds in alleviating the substantial data and computational requirements associated with training video-language foundation models from scratch for video-text learning. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of this emerging field, which begins by summarizing the widely used ILFM and their capabilities. We then systematically classify existing image-to-video transfer learning strategies into two categories: frozen features and modified features, depending on whether the original representations from ILFM are preserved or undergo modifications. Building upon the task-specific nature of image-to-video transfer, this survey methodically elaborates these strategies and details their applications across a spectrum of video-text learning tasks, ranging from fine-grained (e.g., spatio-temporal video grounding) to coarse-grained (e.g., video question answering). We further present a detailed experimental analysis to investigate the efficacy of different image-to-video transfer learning paradigms on a range of downstream video understanding tasks. Finally, we identify prevailing challenges and highlight promising directions for future research. By offering a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to establish a structured roadmap for advancing video-text learning based on existing ILFM, and to inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain.

Abstract: In-car multi-zone speech separation, which captures voices from different speech zones, plays a crucial role in human-vehicle interaction. Although previous SpatialNet has achieved notable results, its high computational cost still hinders real-time applications in vehicles. To this end, this paper proposes LSZone, a lightweight spatial information modeling architecture for real-time in-car multi-zone speech separation. We design a spatial information extraction-compression (SpaIEC) module that combines Mel spectrogram and Interaural Phase Difference (IPD) to reduce computational burden while maintaining performance. Additionally, to efficiently model spatial information, we introduce an extremely lightweight Conv-GRU crossband-narrowband processing (CNP) module. Experimental results demonstrate that LSZone, with a complexity of 0.56G MACs and a real-time factor (RTF) of 0.37, delivers impressive performance in complex noise and multi-speaker scenarios.

Abstract: Quantized neural network training optimizes a discrete, non-differentiable objective. The straight-through estimator (STE) enables backpropagation through surrogate gradients and is widely used. While previous studies have primarily focused on the properties of surrogate gradients and their convergence, the influence of quantization hyperparameters, such as bit width and quantization range, on learning dynamics remains largely unexplored. We theoretically show that in the high-dimensional limit, STE dynamics converge to a deterministic ordinary differential equation. This reveals that STE training exhibits a plateau followed by a sharp drop in generalization error, with plateau length depending on the quantization range. A fixed-point analysis quantifies the asymptotic deviation from the unquantized linear model. We also extend analytical techniques for stochastic gradient descent to nonlinear transformations of weights and inputs.

Abstract: Accurate climate forecasting is vital for Bangladesh, a region highly susceptible to climate change impacts on temperature and rainfall. Existing models often struggle to capture long-range dependencies and complex temporal patterns in climate data. This study introduces an advanced Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model integrated with an attention mechanism to enhance the prediction of temperature and rainfall dynamics. Utilizing comprehensive datasets from 1901-2023, sourced from NASA's POWER Project for temperature and the Humanitarian Data Exchange for rainfall, the model effectively captures seasonal and long-term trends. It outperforms baseline models, including XGBoost, Simple LSTM, and GRU, achieving a test MSE of 0.2411 (normalized units), MAE of 0.3860 degrees C, R^2 of 0.9834, and NRMSE of 0.0370 for temperature, and MSE of 1283.67 mm^2, MAE of 22.91 mm, R^2 of 0.9639, and NRMSE of 0.0354 for rainfall on monthly forecasts. The model demonstrates improved robustness with only a 20 percent increase in MSE under simulated climate trends (compared to an approximately 2.2-fold increase in baseline models without trend features) and a 50 percent degradation under regional variations (compared to an approximately 4.8-fold increase in baseline models without enhancements). These results highlight the model's ability to improve forecasting precision and offer potential insights into the physical processes governing climate variability in Bangladesh, supporting applications in climate-sensitive sectors.

Abstract: Missing data in online reinforcement learning (RL) poses challenges compared to missing data in standard tabular data or in offline policy learning. The need to impute and act at each time step means that imputation cannot be put off until enough data exist to produce stable imputation models. It also means future data collection and learning depend on previous imputations. This paper proposes fully online imputation ensembles. We find that maintaining multiple imputation pathways may help balance the need to capture uncertainty under missingness and the need for efficiency in online settings. We consider multiple approaches for incorporating these pathways into learning and action selection. Using a Grid World experiment with various types of missingness, we provide preliminary evidence that multiple imputation pathways may be a useful framework for constructing simple and efficient online missing data RL methods.

Abstract: Deep learning has generated diverse perspectives in astronomy, with ongoing discussions between proponents and skeptics motivating this review. We examine how neural networks complement classical statistics, extending our data analytical toolkit for modern surveys. Astronomy offers unique opportunities through encoding physical symmetries, conservation laws, and differential equations directly into architectures, creating models that generalize beyond training data. Yet challenges persist as unlabeled observations number in billions while confirmed examples with known properties remain scarce and expensive. This review demonstrates how deep learning incorporates domain knowledge through architectural design, with built-in assumptions guiding models toward physically meaningful solutions. We evaluate where these methods offer genuine advances versus claims requiring careful scrutiny. - Neural architectures overcome trade-offs between scalability, expressivity, and data efficiency by encoding physical symmetries and conservation laws into network structure, enabling learning from limited labeled data. - Simulation-based inference and anomaly detection extract information from complex, non-Gaussian distributions where analytical likelihoods fail, enabling field-level cosmological analysis and systematic discovery of rare phenomena. - Multi-scale neural modeling bridges resolution gaps in astronomical simulations, learning effective subgrid physics from expensive high-fidelity runs to enhance large-volume calculations where direct computation remains prohibitive. - Emerging paradigms-reinforcement learning for telescope operations, foundation models learning from minimal examples, and large language model agents for research automation-show promise though are still developing in astronomical applications.

Abstract: Direction of Arrival (DoA) estimation techniques face a critical trade-off, as classical methods often lack accuracy in challenging, low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, while modern deep learning approaches are too energy-intensive and opaque for resource-constrained, safety-critical systems. We introduce HYPERDOA, a novel estimator leveraging Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC). The framework introduces two distinct feature extraction strategies -- Mean Spatial-Lag Autocorrelation and Spatial Smoothing -- for its HDC pipeline, and then reframes DoA estimation as a pattern recognition problem. This approach leverages HDC's inherent robustness to noise and its transparent algebraic operations to bypass the expensive matrix decompositions and ``black-box'' nature of classical and deep learning methods, respectively. Our evaluation demonstrates that HYPERDOA achieves ~35.39% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods in low-SNR, coherent-source scenarios. Crucially, it also consumes ~93% less energy than competing neural baselines on an embedded NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX platform. This dual advantage in accuracy and efficiency establishes HYPERDOA as a robust and viable solution for mission-critical applications on edge devices.

Abstract: The automated analysis of phonocardiograms is vital for the early diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, yet supervised deep learning is often constrained by the scarcity of expert-annotated data. In this paper, we propose the Self-Supervised Dual-Path Prototypical Network (SS-DPPN), a foundation model for cardiac audio representation and classification from unlabeled data. The framework introduces a dual-path contrastive learning based architecture that simultaneously processes 1D waveforms and 2D spectrograms using a novel hybrid loss. For the downstream task, a metric-learning approach using a Prototypical Network was used that enhances sensitivity and produces well-calibrated and trustworthy predictions. SS-DPPN achieves state-of-the-art performance on four cardiac audio benchmarks. The framework demonstrates exceptional data efficiency with a fully supervised model on three-fold reduction in labeled data. Finally, the learned representations generalize successfully across lung sound classification and heart rate estimation. Our experiments and findings validate SS-DPPN as a robust, reliable, and scalable foundation model for physiological signals.

Abstract: We provide a unified algorithmic framework for ensemble sampling in nonlinear contextual bandits and develop corresponding regret bounds for two most common nonlinear contextual bandit settings: Generalized Linear Ensemble Sampling (\texttt{GLM-ES}) for generalized linear bandits and Neural Ensemble Sampling (\texttt{Neural-ES}) for neural contextual bandits. Both methods maintain multiple estimators for the reward model parameters via maximum likelihood estimation on randomly perturbed data. We prove high-probability frequentist regret bounds of $\mathcal{O}(d^{3/2} \sqrt{T} + d^{9/2})$ for \texttt{GLM-ES} and $\mathcal{O}(\widetilde{d} \sqrt{T})$ for \texttt{Neural-ES}, where $d$ is the dimension of feature vectors, $\widetilde{d}$ is the effective dimension of a neural tangent kernel matrix, and $T$ is the number of rounds. These regret bounds match the state-of-the-art results of randomized exploration algorithms in nonlinear contextual bandit settings. In the theoretical analysis, we introduce techniques that address challenges specific to nonlinear models. Practically, we remove fixed-time horizon assumptions by developing anytime versions of our algorithms, suitable when $T$ is unknown. Finally, we empirically evaluate \texttt{GLM-ES}, \texttt{Neural-ES}, and their anytime variants, demonstrating strong performance. Overall, our results establish ensemble sampling as a provable and practical randomized exploration approach for nonlinear contextual bandits.

Abstract: General-purpose ASR underperforms for atypical speakers, such as L2 learners, reinforcing bias and limiting use in education and accessibility. Using the CEFR-graded Speak and Improve corpus, we show that naive fine-tuning of Whisper reduces average WER but simultaneously widens disparities and disproportionately harms lower-level learners. To address this, we propose two strategies: (i) proficiency-aware multitask learning, jointly optimizing ASR with proficiency classification, and (ii) targeted augmentation, applying spectrogram masking to low-proficiency speech to counter imbalance. These approaches reduce WER by up to 29.4 percent (relative) and insertion/deletion errors by as much as 58.6 percent (relative). Crucially, despite the severe imbalance of the dataset reflecting real-world distributions, both strategies consistently narrow proficiency gaps, advancing equitable ASR for L2 learners.

Abstract: We introduce a general stochastic differential equation framework for modelling multiobjective optimization dynamics in iterative Large Language Model (LLM) interactions. Our framework captures the inherent stochasticity of LLM responses through explicit diffusion terms and reveals systematic interference patterns between competing objectives via an interference matrix formulation. We validate our theoretical framework using iterative code generation as a proof-of-concept application, analyzing 400 sessions across security, efficiency, and functionality objectives. Our results demonstrate strategy-dependent convergence behaviors with rates ranging from 0.33 to 1.29, and predictive accuracy achieving R2 = 0.74 for balanced approaches. This work proposes the feasibility of dynamical systems analysis for multi-objective LLM interactions, with code generation serving as an initial validation domain.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have provided brilliant performance across various tasks. However, this success often comes at the cost of unnecessarily large model sizes, high computational demands, and substantial memory footprints. Typically, powerful architectures are trained at full depths but not all datasets or tasks require such high model capacity. Training very deep architectures on relatively low-complexity datasets frequently leads to wasted computation, unnecessary energy consumption, and excessive memory usage, which in turn makes deployment of models on resource-constrained devices impractical. To address this problem, we introduce Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs), which provide a balance between model depth and task complexity. Specifically, we propose a NAS like training strategy called progressive depth expansion, which begins by training deep networks at shallower depths and incrementally increases their depth as the earlier blocks converge, continuing this process until the target accuracy is reached. ODNs use only the optimal depth for the given datasets, removing redundant layers. This cuts down future training and inference costs, lowers the memory footprint, enhances computational efficiency, and facilitates deployment on edge devices. Empirical results show that the optimal depths of ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 for MNIST and SVHN, achieve up to 98.64 % and 96.44 % reduction in memory footprint, while maintaining a competitive accuracy of 99.31 % and 96.08 %, respectively.

Abstract: As autonomous vehicles become an essential component of modern transportation, they are increasingly vulnerable to threats such as GPS spoofing attacks. This study presents an adaptive detection approach utilizing a dynamically tuned Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, designed to adjust the detection threshold ({\epsilon}) in real-time. The threshold is updated based on the recursive mean and standard deviation of displacement errors between GPS and in-vehicle sensors data, but only at instances classified as non-anomalous. Furthermore, an initial threshold, determined from 120,000 clean data samples, ensures the capability to identify even subtle and gradual GPS spoofing attempts from the beginning. To assess the performance of the proposed method, five different subsets from the real-world Honda Research Institute Driving Dataset (HDD) are selected to simulate both large and small magnitude GPS spoofing attacks. The modified algorithm effectively identifies turn-by-turn, stop, overshoot, and multiple small biased spoofing attacks, achieving detection accuracies of 98.621%, 99.960.1%, 99.880.1%, and 98.380.1%, respectively. This work provides a substantial advancement in enhancing the security and safety of AVs against GPS spoofing threats.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly used to fine-tune diffusion models, but a key challenge arises from the mismatch between stochastic samplers used during training and deterministic samplers used during inference. In practice, models are fine-tuned using stochastic SDE samplers to encourage exploration, while inference typically relies on deterministic ODE samplers for efficiency and stability. This discrepancy induces a reward gap, raising concerns about whether high-quality outputs can be expected during inference. In this paper, we theoretically characterize this reward gap and provide non-vacuous bounds for general diffusion models, along with sharper convergence rates for Variance Exploding (VE) and Variance Preserving (VP) Gaussian models. Methodologically, we adopt the generalized denoising diffusion implicit models (gDDIM) framework to support arbitrarily high levels of stochasticity, preserving data marginals throughout. Empirically, our findings through large-scale experiments on text-to-image models using denoising diffusion policy optimization (DDPO) and mixed group relative policy optimization (MixGRPO) validate that reward gaps consistently narrow over training, and ODE sampling quality improves when models are updated using higher-stochasticity SDE training.

Abstract: Persian Language, despite being spoken by over 100 million people worldwide, remains severely underrepresented in high-quality speech corpora, particularly for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis applications. Existing Persian speech datasets are typically smaller than their English counterparts, which creates a key limitation for developing Persian speech technologies. We address this gap by introducing ParsVoice, the largest Persian speech corpus designed specifically for TTS applications. We created an automated pipeline that transforms raw audiobook content into TTS-ready data, incorporating components such as a BERT-based sentence completion detector, a binary search boundary optimization method for precise audio-text alignment, and multi-dimensional quality assessment frameworks tailored to Persian. The pipeline processes 2,000 audiobooks, yielding 3,526 hours of clean speech, which was further filtered into a 1,804-hour high-quality subset suitable for TTS, featuring more than 470 speakers. ParsVoice is the largest high-quality Persian speech dataset, offering speaker diversity and audio quality comparable to major English corpora. The complete dataset has been made publicly available to accelerate the development of Persian speech technologies and to serve as a template for other low-resource languages. The ParsVoice dataset is publicly available at ParsVoice (https://huggingface.co/datasets/MohammadJRanjbar/ParsVoice).

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Disentangled Style-Content GAN (DISC-GAN), which integrates style-content disentanglement with a cluster-specific training strategy towards photorealistic underwater image synthesis. The quality of synthetic underwater images is challenged by optical due to phenomena such as color attenuation and turbidity. These phenomena are represented by distinct stylistic variations across different waterbodies, such as changes in tint and haze. While generative models are well-suited to capture complex patterns, they often lack the ability to model the non-uniform conditions of diverse underwater environments. To address these challenges, we employ K-means clustering to partition a dataset into style-specific domains. We use separate encoders to get latent spaces for style and content; we further integrate these latent representations via Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) and decode the result to produce the final synthetic image. The model is trained independently on each style cluster to preserve domain-specific characteristics. Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, obtaining a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.9012, an average Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 32.5118 dB, and a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 13.3728.

Abstract: Today's deep learning architectures are primarily based on perceptron models, which do not capture the oscillatory dynamics characteristic of biological neurons. Although oscillatory systems have recently gained attention for their closer resemblance to neural behavior, they still fall short of modeling the intricate spatio-temporal interactions observed in natural neural circuits. In this paper, we propose a bio-inspired oscillatory state system (BioOSS) designed to emulate the wave-like propagation dynamics critical to neural processing, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), where complex activity patterns emerge. BioOSS comprises two interacting populations of neurons: p neurons, which represent simplified membrane-potential-like units inspired by pyramidal cells in cortical columns, and o neurons, which govern propagation velocities and modulate the lateral spread of activity. Through local interactions, these neurons produce wave-like propagation patterns. The model incorporates trainable parameters for damping and propagation speed, enabling flexible adaptation to task-specific spatio-temporal structures. We evaluate BioOSS on both synthetic and real-world tasks, demonstrating superior performance and enhanced interpretability compared to alternative architectures.

Abstract: Text simplification is essential for making public health information accessible to diverse populations, including those with limited health literacy. However, commonly used evaluation metrics in Natural Language Processing (NLP), such as BLEU, FKGL, and SARI, mainly capture surface-level features and fail to account for human-centered qualities like clarity, trustworthiness, tone, cultural relevance, and actionability. This limitation is particularly critical in high-stakes health contexts, where communication must be not only simple but also usable, respectful, and trustworthy. To address this gap, we propose the Human-Centered Readability Score (HCRS), a five-dimensional evaluation framework grounded in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and health communication research. HCRS integrates automatic measures with structured human feedback to capture the relational and contextual aspects of readability. We outline the framework, discuss its integration into participatory evaluation workflows, and present a protocol for empirical validation. This work aims to advance the evaluation of health text simplification beyond surface metrics, enabling NLP systems that align more closely with diverse users' needs, expectations, and lived experiences.

Abstract: Clouds remain a critical challenge in optical satellite imagery, hindering reliable analysis for environmental monitoring, land cover mapping, and climate research. To overcome this, we propose MSCloudCAM, a Cross-Attention with Multi-Scale Context Network tailored for multispectral and multi-sensor cloud segmentation. Our framework exploits the spectral richness of Sentinel-2 (CloudSEN12) and Landsat-8 (L8Biome) data to classify four semantic categories: clear sky, thin cloud, thick cloud, and cloud shadow. MSCloudCAM combines a Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical feature extraction with multi-scale context modules ASPP and PSP for enhanced scale-aware learning. A Cross-Attention block enables effective multisensor and multispectral feature fusion, while the integration of an Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB) and a Spatial Attention Module adaptively refine feature representations. Comprehensive experiments on CloudSEN12 and L8Biome demonstrate that MSCloudCAM delivers state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, surpassing leading baseline architectures while maintaining competitive parameter efficiency and FLOPs. These results underscore the model's effectiveness and practicality, making it well-suited for large-scale Earth observation tasks and real-world applications.

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of using a deep learning model to prune graphs and the ability of this method to integrate explainability into spatio-temporal problems through a new approach. Instead of applying explainability to the model's behavior, we seek to gain a better understanding of the problem itself. To this end, we propose a novel model that integrates an optimized pruning mechanism capable of removing nodes from the graph during the training process, rather than doing so as a separate procedure. This integration allows the architecture to learn how to minimize prediction error while selecting the most relevant nodes. Thus, during training, the model searches for the most relevant subset of nodes, obtaining the most important elements of the problem, facilitating its analysis. To evaluate the proposed approach, we used several widely used traffic datasets, comparing the accuracy obtained by pruning with the model and with other methods. The experiments demonstrate that our method is capable of retaining a greater amount of information as the graph reduces in size compared to the other methods used. These results highlight the potential of pruning as a tool for developing models capable of simplifying spatio-temporal problems, thereby obtaining their most important elements.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in mental health contexts, from structured therapeutic support tools to informal chat-based well-being assistants. While these systems increase accessibility, scalability, and personalization, their integration into mental health care brings privacy and safety challenges that have not been well-examined. Unlike traditional clinical interactions, LLM-mediated therapy often lacks a clear structure for what information is collected, how it is processed, and how it is stored or reused. Users without clinical guidance may over-disclose personal information, which is sometimes irrelevant to their presenting concern, due to misplaced trust, lack of awareness of data risks, or the conversational design of the system. This overexposure raises privacy concerns and also increases the potential for LLM bias, misinterpretation, and long-term data misuse. We propose a framework embedding Artificial Intelligence (AI) literacy interventions directly into mental health conversational systems, and outline a study plan to evaluate their impact on disclosure safety, trust, and user experience.

<title>Is Implicit Knowledge Enough for LLMs? A RAG Approach for Tree-based Structures</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are adept at generating responses based on information within their context. While this ability is useful for interacting with structured data like code files, another popular method, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), retrieves relevant documents to augment the model's in-context learning. However, it is not well-explored how to best represent this retrieved knowledge for generating responses on structured data, particularly hierarchical structures like trees. In this work, we propose a novel bottom-up method to linearize knowledge from tree-like structures (like a GitHub repository) by generating implicit, aggregated summaries at each hierarchical level. This approach enables the knowledge to be stored in a knowledge base and used directly with RAG. We then compare our method to using RAG on raw, unstructured code, evaluating the accuracy and quality of the generated responses. Our results show that while response quality is comparable across both methods, our approach generates over 68% fewer documents in the retriever, a significant gain in efficiency. This finding suggests that leveraging implicit, linearized knowledge may be a highly effective and scalable strategy for handling complex, hierarchical data structures.

Abstract: Generative AI is reshaping how software is designed, written, and maintained. Advances in large language models (LLMs) are enabling new development styles - from chat-oriented programming and 'vibe coding' to agentic programming - that can accelerate productivity and broaden access. This paper examines how AI-assisted techniques are changing software engineering practice, and the related issues of trust, accountability, and shifting skills. We survey iterative chat-based development, multi-agent systems, dynamic prompt orchestration, and integration via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Using case studies and industry data, we outline both the opportunities (faster cycles, democratized coding) and the challenges (model reliability and cost) of applying generative AI to coding. We describe new roles, skills, and best practices for using AI in a responsible and effective way.

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown promise in improving diagnostic accuracy from chest X-rays, but they also risk perpetuating healthcare disparities when performance varies across demographic groups. In this work, we present a comprehensive bias detection and mitigation framework targeting sex, age, and race-based disparities when performing diagnostic tasks with chest X-rays. We extend a recent CNN-XGBoost pipeline to support multi-label classification and evaluate its performance across four medical conditions. We show that replacing the final layer of CNN with an eXtreme Gradient Boosting classifier improves the fairness of the subgroup while maintaining or improving the overall predictive performance. To validate its generalizability, we apply the method to different backbones, namely DenseNet-121 and ResNet-50, and achieve similarly strong performance and fairness outcomes, confirming its model-agnostic design. We further compare this lightweight adapter training method with traditional full-model training bias mitigation techniques, including adversarial training, reweighting, data augmentation, and active learning, and find that our approach offers competitive or superior bias reduction at a fraction of the computational cost. Finally, we show that combining eXtreme Gradient Boosting retraining with active learning yields the largest reduction in bias across all demographic subgroups, both in and out of distribution on the CheXpert and MIMIC datasets, establishing a practical and effective path toward equitable deep learning deployment in clinical radiology.

Abstract: We present an approach to software testing automation using Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for Quality Engineering (QE) artifact creation. We combine autonomous AI agents with hybrid vector-graph knowledge systems to automate test plan, case, and QE metric generation. Our approach addresses traditional software testing limitations by leveraging LLMs such as Gemini and Mistral, multi-agent orchestration, and enhanced contextualization. The system achieves remarkable accuracy improvements from 65% to 94.8% while ensuring comprehensive document traceability throughout the quality engineering lifecycle. Experimental validation of enterprise Corporate Systems Engineering and SAP migration projects demonstrates an 85% reduction in testing timeline, an 85% improvement in test suite efficiency, and projected 35% cost savings, resulting in a 2-month acceleration of go-live.

Abstract: Transliteration has emerged as a promising means to bridge the gap between various languages in multilingual NLP, showing promising results especially for languages using non-Latin scripts. We investigate the degree to which shared script, overlapping token vocabularies, and shared phonology contribute to performance of multilingual models. To this end, we conduct controlled experiments using three kinds of transliteration (romanization, phonemic transcription, and substitution ciphers) as well as orthography. We evaluate each model on two downstream tasks -- named entity recognition (NER) and natural language inference (NLI) -- and find that romanization significantly outperforms other input types in 7 out of 8 evaluation settings, largely consistent with our hypothesis that it is the most effective approach. We further analyze how each factor contributed to the success, and suggest that having longer (subword) tokens shared with pre-trained languages leads to better utilization of the model.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is becoming increasingly essential for Question Answering (QA) in the financial sector, where accurate and contextually grounded insights from complex public disclosures are crucial. However, existing financial RAG systems face two significant challenges: (1) they struggle to process heterogeneous data formats, such as text, tables, and figures; and (2) they encounter difficulties in balancing general-domain applicability with company-specific adaptation. To overcome these challenges, we present VeritasFi, an innovative hybrid RAG framework that incorporates a multi-modal preprocessing pipeline alongside a cutting-edge two-stage training strategy for its re-ranking component. VeritasFi enhances financial QA through three key innovations: (1) A multi-modal preprocessing pipeline that seamlessly transforms heterogeneous data into a coherent, machine-readable format. (2) A tripartite hybrid retrieval engine that operates in parallel, combining deep multi-path retrieval over a semantically indexed document corpus, real-time data acquisition through tool utilization, and an expert-curated memory bank for high-frequency questions, ensuring comprehensive scope, accuracy, and efficiency. (3) A two-stage training strategy for the document re-ranker, which initially constructs a general, domain-specific model using anonymized data, followed by rapid fine-tuning on company-specific data for targeted applications. By integrating our proposed designs, VeritasFi presents a groundbreaking framework that greatly enhances the adaptability and robustness of financial RAG systems, providing a scalable solution for both general-domain and company-specific QA tasks. Code accompanying this work is available at https://github.com/simplew4y/VeritasFi.git.

Abstract: An AI-ML-powered quality engineering approach uses AI-ML to enhance software quality assessments by predicting defects. Existing ML models struggle with noisy data types, imbalances, pattern recognition, feature extraction, and generalization. To address these challenges, we develop a new model, Adaptive Differential Evolution (ADE) based Quantum Variational Autoencoder-Transformer (QVAET) Model (ADE-QVAET). ADE combines with QVAET to obtain high-dimensional latent features and maintain sequential dependencies, resulting in enhanced defect prediction accuracy. ADE optimization enhances model convergence and predictive performance. ADE-QVAET integrates AI-ML techniques such as tuning hyperparameters for scalable and accurate software defect prediction, representing an AI-ML-driven technology for quality engineering. During training with a 90% training percentage, ADE-QVAET achieves high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of 98.08%, 92.45%, 94.67%, and 98.12%, respectively, when compared to the Differential Evolution (DE) ML model.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in generating high-dimensional samples across domains such as vision, language, and the sciences. Although continuous-state diffusion models have been extensively studied both empirically and theoretically, discrete-state diffusion models, essential for applications involving text, sequences, and combinatorial structures, remain significantly less understood from a theoretical standpoint. In particular, all existing analyses of discrete-state models assume score estimation error bounds without studying sample complexity results. In this work, we present a principled theoretical framework for discrete-state diffusion, providing the first sample complexity bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$. Our structured decomposition of the score estimation error into statistical, approximation, optimization, and clipping components offers critical insights into how discrete-state models can be trained efficiently. This analysis addresses a fundamental gap in the literature and establishes the theoretical tractability and practical relevance of discrete-state diffusion models.

Abstract: Graph heterophily, where connected nodes have different labels, has attracted significant interest recently. Most existing works adopt a simplified approach - using low-pass filters for homophilic graphs and high-pass filters for heterophilic graphs. However, we discover that the relationship between graph heterophily and spectral filters is more complex - the optimal filter response varies across frequency components and does not follow a strict monotonic correlation with heterophily degree. This finding challenges conventional fixed filter designs and suggests the need for adaptive filtering to preserve expressiveness in graph embeddings. Formally, natural questions arise: Given a heterophilic graph G, how and to what extent will the varying heterophily degree of G affect the performance of GNNs? How can we design adaptive filters to fit those varying heterophilic connections? Our theoretical analysis reveals that the average frequency response of GNNs and graph heterophily degree do not follow a strict monotonic correlation, necessitating adaptive graph filters to guarantee good generalization performance. Hence, we propose [METHOD NAME], a simple yet powerful GNN, which extracts information across the heterophily spectrum and combines salient representations through adaptive mixing. [METHOD NAME]'s superior performance achieves up to 9.2% accuracy improvement over leading baselines across homophilic and heterophilic graphs.

Abstract: Robots navigating dynamic, cluttered, and semantically complex environments must integrate perception, symbolic reasoning, and spatial planning to generalize across diverse layouts and object categories. Existing methods often rely on static priors or limited memory, constraining adaptability under partial observability and semantic ambiguity. We present GRIP, Grid-based Relay with Intermediate Planning, a unified, modular framework with three scalable variants: GRIP-L (Lightweight), optimized for symbolic navigation via semantic occupancy grids; GRIP-F (Full), supporting multi-hop anchor chaining and LLM-based introspection; and GRIP-R (Real-World), enabling physical robot deployment under perceptual uncertainty. GRIP integrates dynamic 2D grid construction, open-vocabulary object grounding, co-occurrence-aware symbolic planning, and hybrid policy execution using behavioral cloning, D* search, and grid-conditioned control. Empirical results on AI2-THOR and RoboTHOR benchmarks show that GRIP achieves up to 9.6% higher success rates and over $2\times$ improvement in path efficiency (SPL and SAE) on long-horizon tasks. Qualitative analyses reveal interpretable symbolic plans in ambiguous scenes. Real-world deployment on a Jetbot further validates GRIP's generalization under sensor noise and environmental variation. These results position GRIP as a robust, scalable, and explainable framework bridging simulation and real-world navigation.

Abstract: Software practitioners are discussing GenAI transformations in software project management openly and widely. To understand the state of affairs, we performed a grey literature review using 47 publicly available practitioner sources including blogs, articles, and industry reports. We found that software project managers primarily perceive GenAI as an "assistant", "copilot", or "friend" rather than as a "PM replacement", with support of GenAI in automating routine tasks, predictive analytics, communication and collaboration, and in agile practices leading to project success. Practitioners emphasize responsible GenAI usage given concerns such as hallucinations, ethics and privacy, and lack of emotional intelligence and human judgment. We present upskilling requirements for software project managers in the GenAI era mapped to the Project Management Institute's talent triangle. We share key recommendations for both practitioners and researchers.

Abstract: Contrastive Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot capabilities. However, their cross-modal alignment remains biased toward English due to limited multilingual multimodal data. Recent multilingual extensions have alleviated this gap but enforce instance-level alignment while neglecting the global geometry of the shared embedding space. We address this problem by introducing ToMCLIP (Topological Alignment for Multilingual CLIP), a topology-aware framework aligning embedding spaces with topology-preserving constraints. The proposed method applies persistent homology to define a topological alignment loss and approximates persistence diagram with theoretical error bounds using graph sparsification strategy. This work validates the proposed approach, showing enhanced structural coherence of multilingual representations, higher zero-shot accuracy on the CIFAR-100, and stronger multilingual retrieval performance on the xFlickr&amp;CO. Beyond VLMs, the proposed approach provides a general method for incorporating topological alignment into representation learning.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection(TSAD) is a critical task in signal processing field, ensuring the reliability of complex systems. Reconstruction-based methods dominate in TSAD. Among these methods, VAE-based methods have achieved promising results. Existing VAE-based methods suffer from the limitation of single-window feature and insufficient leveraging of long-term time and frequency information. We propose a Conditional Variational AutoEncoder with Long-term dependency and Probabilistic time-frequency fusion, named LPCVAE. LPCVAE introduces LSTM to capture long-term dependencies beyond windows. It further incorporates a Product-of-Experts (PoE) mechanism for adaptive and distribution-level probabilistic fusion. This design effectively mitigates time-frequency information loss. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate it outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The results confirm that integrating long-term time and frequency representations with adaptive fusion yields a robust and efficient solution for TSAD.

Abstract: The exponential growth of the global makeup market has paralleled advancements in virtual makeup simulation technology. Despite the progress led by GANs, their application still encounters significant challenges, including training instability and limited customization capabilities. Addressing these challenges, we introduce DreamMakup - a novel training-free Diffusion model based Makeup Customization method, leveraging the inherent advantages of diffusion models for superior controllability and precise real-image editing. DreamMakeup employs early-stopped DDIM inversion to preserve the facial structure and identity while enabling extensive customization through various conditioning inputs such as reference images, specific RGB colors, and textual descriptions. Our model demonstrates notable improvements over existing GAN-based and recent diffusion-based frameworks - improved customization, color-matching capabilities, identity preservation and compatibility with textual descriptions or LLMs with affordable computational costs.

Abstract: Explainable recommendation through counterfactual reasoning seeks to identify the influential aspects of items in recommendations, which can then be used as explanations. However, state-of-the-art approaches, which aim to minimize changes in product aspects while reversing their recommended decisions according to an aggregated decision boundary score, often lead to factual inaccuracies in explanations. To solve this problem, in this work we propose a novel method of Comparative Counterfactual Explanations for Recommendation (CoCountER). CoCountER creates counterfactual data based on soft swap operations, enabling explanations for recommendations of arbitrary pairs of comparative items. Empirical experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires precise alignment between visual content and linguistic descriptions, a capability that remains limited in current models, particularly in non-English settings. While models like CLIP perform well on global alignment, they often struggle to capture fine-grained details in object attributes, spatial relations, and linguistic expressions, with limited support for bilingual comprehension. To address these challenges, we introduce FG-CLIP 2, a bilingual vision-language model designed to advance fine-grained alignment for both English and Chinese. Our approach leverages rich fine-grained supervision, including region-text matching and long-caption modeling, alongside multiple discriminative objectives. We further introduce the Textual Intra-modal Contrastive (TIC) loss to better distinguish semantically similar captions. Trained on a carefully curated mixture of large-scale English and Chinese data, FG-CLIP 2 achieves powerful bilingual performance. To enable rigorous evaluation, we present a new benchmark for Chinese multimodal understanding, featuring long-caption retrieval and bounding box classification. Extensive experiments on 29 datasets across 8 tasks show that FG-CLIP 2 outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in both languages. We release the model, code, and benchmark to facilitate future research on bilingual fine-grained alignment.

Abstract: Reasoning is not just about solving problems -- it is also about evaluating which problems are worth solving at all. Evaluations of artificial intelligence (AI) systems primarily focused on problem solving, historically by studying how models play games such as chess and Go. In this paper, we advocate for a new paradigm that assesses AI systems' evaluation of games. First, we introduce a formalism for evaluating such evaluations. We then leverage a large-scale dataset of over $100$ novel board games and over 450 human judgments to compare evaluations produced by modern language and reasoning models against those of people and symbolic computational agents. We consider two kinds of evaluative queries: assessing the payoff (or fairness) and the funness of games. These queries span two dimensions relevant to the design of evaluations of AI evaluations: how complex a query is to compute and how difficult a query is to quantify. Our results show that reasoning models are generally more aligned to people in their evaluations of games than non-reasoning language models. However, we observe a non-monotonic relationship: as models get closer to game-theoretic optimal, their fit to human data weakens. We also observe more "jaggedness" across models for assessing funness, in line with the greater difficulty of quantifying this query. Across queries and games, reasoning models show highly variable and unpredictable resource usage when assessing queries, pointing to the importance of imbuing more resource-rational meta-reasoning in language and reasoning models.

Abstract: With the growing deployment of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in real-world embodied AI systems, their increasing vulnerability to backdoor attacks poses a serious safety threat. A backdoored VLA agent can be covertly triggered by a pre-injected backdoor to execute adversarial actions, potentially causing system failures or even physical harm. Although backdoor attacks on VLA models have been explored, prior work has focused only on untargeted attacks, leaving the more practically threatening scenario of targeted manipulation unexamined. In this paper, we study targeted backdoor attacks on VLA models and introduce TabVLA, a novel framework that enables such attacks via black-box fine-tuning. TabVLA explores two deployment-relevant inference-time threat models: input-stream editing and in-scene triggering. It formulates poisoned data generation as an optimization problem to improve attack effectivess. Experiments with OpenVLA-7B on the LIBERO benchmark reveal that the vision channel is the principal attack surface: targeted backdoors succeed with minimal poisoning, remain robust across variations in trigger design, and are degraded only by positional mismatches between fine-tuning and inference triggers. We also investigate a potential detection-based defense against TabVLA, which reconstructs latent visual triggers from the input stream to flag activation-conditioned backdoor samples. Our work highlights the vulnerability of VLA models to targeted backdoor manipulation and underscores the need for more advanced defenses.

<title>Redundancy as a Structural Information Principle for Learning and Generalization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10938</link>

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework that extends classical information theory to finite and structured systems by redefining redundancy as a fundamental property of information organization rather than inefficiency. In this framework, redundancy is expressed as a general family of informational divergences that unifies multiple classical measures, such as mutual information, chi-squared dependence, and spectral redundancy, under a single geometric principle. This reveals that these traditional quantities are not isolated heuristics but projections of a shared redundancy geometry. The theory further predicts that redundancy is bounded both above and below, giving rise to an optimal equilibrium that balances over-compression (loss of structure) and over-coupling (collapse). While classical communication theory favors minimal redundancy for transmission efficiency, finite and structured systems, such as those underlying real-world learning, achieve maximal stability and generalization near this equilibrium. Experiments with masked autoencoders are used to illustrate and verify this principle: the model exhibits a stable redundancy level where generalization peaks. Together, these results establish redundancy as a measurable and tunable quantity that bridges the asymptotic world of communication and the finite world of learning.

<title>Unify Variables in Neural Scaling Laws for General Audio Representations via Embedding Effective Rank</title>

Abstract: Scaling laws have profoundly shaped our understanding of model performance in computer vision and natural language processing, yet their application to general audio representation learning remains underexplored. A key challenge lies in the multifactorial nature of general audio representation-representation quality is jointly influenced by variables such as audio length, embedding dimensionality, model depth, model architecture, data volume, etc., many of which are difficult to isolate or express analytically. In this work, we present a systematic study of scaling laws for general audio representations by utilizing embedding effective rank (RankMe) as a unifying metric that encapsulates the impact of diverse variables on representation quality. RankMe enables a label-free, information-theoretic quantification of audio embeddings, allowing us to examine scaling behaviors across a wide hyper-parameter space, including model size, training data volume, computational budget, architectural configurations, etc. Our empirical findings reveal a consistent power-law relationship between RankMe and representation quality, suggesting that embedding effective rank serves as a reliable proxy for assessing and predicting model performance in audio representation learning. This work not only validates the applicability of classical scaling principles to the general audio domain but also offers a theoretically grounded and empirically robust framework for guiding future model scaling strategies in audio foundation models.

<title>Project-Level C-to-Rust Translation via Synergistic Integration of Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Translating C code into safe Rust is an effective way to ensure its memory safety. Compared to rule-based translation which produces Rust code that remains largely unsafe, LLM-based methods can generate more idiomatic and safer Rust code because LLMs have been trained on vast amount of human-written idiomatic code. Although promising, existing LLM-based methods still struggle with project-level C-to-Rust translation. They typically partition a C project into smaller units (\eg{} functions) based on call graphs and translate them bottom-up to resolve program dependencies. However, this bottom-up, unit-by-unit paradigm often fails to translate pointers due to the lack of a global perspective on their usage. To address this problem, we propose a novel C-Rust Pointer Knowledge Graph (KG) that enriches a code-dependency graph with two types of pointer semantics: (i) pointer-usage information which record global behaviors such as points-to flows and map lower-level struct usage to higher-level units; and (ii) Rust-oriented annotations which encode ownership, mutability, nullability, and lifetime. Synthesizing the \kg{} with LLMs, we further propose \ourtool{}, which implements a project-level C-to-Rust translation technique. In \ourtool{}, the \kg{} provides LLMs with comprehensive pointer semantics from a global perspective, thus guiding LLMs towards generating safe and idiomatic Rust code from a given C project. Our experiments show that \ourtool{} reduces unsafe usages in translated Rust by 99.9\% compared to both rule-based translation and traditional LLM-based rewriting, while achieving an average 29.3\% higher functional correctness than those fuzzing-enhanced LLM methods.

<title>Rediscovering Entropy Regularization: Adaptive Coefficient Unlocks Its Potential for LLM Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Reasoning ability has become a defining capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) emerging as a key paradigm to enhance it. However, RLVR training often suffers from policy entropy collapse, where the policy becomes overly deterministic, hindering exploration and limiting reasoning performance. While entropy regularization is a common remedy, its effectiveness is highly sensitive to the fixed coefficient, making it unstable across tasks and models. In this work, we revisit entropy regularization in RLVR and argue that its potential has been largely underestimated. Our analysis shows that (i) tasks of varying difficulty demand distinct exploration intensities, and (ii) balanced exploration may require the policy entropy to be maintained within a moderate range below its initial level. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Entropy Regularization (AER)--a framework that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation via three components: difficulty-aware coefficient allocation, initial-anchored target entropy, and dynamic global coefficient adjustment. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that AER consistently outperforms baselines, improving both reasoning accuracy and exploration capability.

Abstract: Toxic content has become an increasingly critical social issue with the rapid expansion of online communication. While numerous studies explored methods for detecting and detoxifying such content, most have focused primarily on English, leaving low-resource language underrepresented. Consequently, Large Language Models~(LLMs) often struggle to identify and neutralize toxic expressions in these languages. This challenge becomes even more pronounced when user employ obfuscation techniques to evade detection systems. Therefore, we propose a \textbf{KOTOX: Korean Toxic Dataset} for deobfuscation and detoxicification to address this issue. We categorize various obfuscation approaches based on linguistic characteristics of Korean and define a set of transformation rules grounded in real-word examples. Using these rules, we construct three dataset versions (easy, normal, and hard) representing different levels of obfuscation difficulty. This is the first dataset that simultaneously supports deobfuscation and detoxification for the Korean language. We expect it to facilitate better understanding and mitigating of obfuscated toxic content in LLM for low-resource languages. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/leeyejin1231/KOTOX.

<title>MC#: Mixture Compressor for Mixture-of-Experts Large Models</title>

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) effectively scales large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) by increasing capacity through sparse activation. However, preloading all experts into memory and activating multiple experts per input introduces significant computational and memory overhead, making the expert module a major contributor to model size and inference cost. To address this, we propose MC# (Mixture-Compressor-sharp), a framework that combines static quantization and dynamic expert pruning by leveraging the significance of experts and tokens for aggressive compression of MoE-LLMs/VLMs. To reduce storage and loading costs, we introduce Pre-Loading Mixed-Precision Quantization (PMQ), which optimizes bit allocation via linear programming, balancing expert importance and quantization error for a Pareto-optimal trade-off between size and performance. To reduce runtime computation, Online Top-any Pruning (OTP) uses Gumbel-Softmax sampling to dynamically select a subset of experts per token, enabling fine-grained control over activation. By combining PMQ's static bit-width optimization with OTP's dynamic routing, MC# achieves extreme compression with minimal accuracy loss. On DeepSeek-VL2, MC# achieves a 6.2 times weight reduction at 2.57 average bits with only a 1.7% accuracy drop across five multimodal benchmarks. Additionally, OTP reduces expert activation over 20% with less than 1% performance degradation, demonstrating strong potential for efficient MoE-based model deployment.

Abstract: The reward model (RM) plays a crucial role in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences through Reinforcement Learning, where the Bradley-Terry (BT) objective has been recognized as simple yet powerful, specifically for pairwise preference learning. However, BT-based RMs often struggle to effectively distinguish between similar preference responses, leading to insufficient separation between preferred and non-preferred outputs. Consequently, they may easily overfit easy samples and cannot generalize well to Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) samples, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, this paper introduces an effective enhancement to BT-based RMs through an adaptive margin mechanism. Specifically, we design to dynamically adjust the RM focus on more challenging samples through margins, based on both semantic similarity and model-predicted reward differences, which is approached from a distributional perspective solvable with Optimal Transport (OT). By incorporating these factors into a principled OT cost matrix design, our adaptive margin enables the RM to better capture distributional differences between chosen and rejected responses, yielding significant improvements in performance, convergence speed, and generalization capabilities. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms several existing RM techniques, showcasing enhanced performance in both In-Distribution (ID) and OOD settings. Moreover, RLHF experiments support our practical effectiveness in better aligning LLMs with human preferences. Our code is available at https://github.com/BIRlz/APLOT

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have witnessed astonishing advancements in recent years. Despite these successes, MLLMs remain vulnerable to flase premise problems. However, existing benchmarks targeting this issue are limited in scope: they often lack fine-grained categorization, exhibit insufficient coverage, and thus fail to provide a rigorous evaluation of the ability of models to recognize false premises. To bridge this gap, we introduce a fully automated pipeline for constructing a comprehensive benchmark of false premise questions. Our method systematically categorizes the premises into three main types and thirteen subtypes according to the abilities required to identify the premises, resulting in the JBA dataset.Results show current MLLMs still struggle with false premise recognition. Building upon this benchmark, we further propose a recognition enhancement framework tailored to strengthen the robustness of MLLMs to detect false premises. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained with our framework achieve significant improvements in false premise recognition.

Abstract: Hate speech remains prevalent in human society and continues to evolve in its forms and expressions. Modern advancements in internet and online anonymity accelerate its rapid spread and complicate its detection. However, hate speech datasets exhibit diverse characteristics primarily because they are constructed from different sources and platforms, each reflecting different linguistic styles and social contexts. Despite this diversity, prior studies on hate speech detection often rely on fixed methodologies without adapting to data-specific features. We introduce RV-HATE, a detection framework designed to account for the dataset-specific characteristics of each hate speech dataset. RV-HATE consists of multiple specialized modules, where each module focuses on distinct linguistic or contextual features of hate speech. The framework employs reinforcement learning to optimize weights that determine the contribution of each module for a given dataset. A voting mechanism then aggregates the module outputs to produce the final decision. RV-HATE offers two primary advantages: (1)~it improves detection accuracy by tailoring the detection process to dataset-specific attributes, and (2)~it also provides interpretable insights into the distinctive features of each dataset. Consequently, our approach effectively addresses implicit hate speech and achieves superior performance compared to conventional static methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/leeyejin1231/RV-HATE.

Abstract: Recent AI regulations call for data that remain useful for innovation while resistant to misuse, balancing utility with protection at the model level. Existing approaches either perturb data to make it unlearnable or retrain models to suppress transfer, but neither governs inference by unknown models, and both typically require control over training. We propose non-transferable examples (NEs), a training-free and data-agnostic input-side usage-control mechanism. We recode inputs within a model-specific low-sensitivity subspace, preserving outputs for the authorized model while reducing performance on unauthorized models through subspace misalignment. We establish formal bounds that guarantee utility for the authorized model and quantify deviation for unauthorized ones, with the Hoffman-Wielandt inequality linking degradation to spectral differences. Empirically, NEs retain performance on diverse vision backbones and state-of-the-art vision-language models under common preprocessing, whereas non-target models collapse even with reconstruction attempts. These results establish NEs as a practical means to preserve intended data utility while preventing unauthorized exploitation.

Abstract: The promise of LLM watermarking rests on a core assumption that a specific watermark proves authorship by a specific model. We demonstrate that this assumption is dangerously flawed. We introduce the threat of watermark spoofing, a sophisticated attack that allows a malicious model to generate text containing the authentic-looking watermark of a trusted, victim model. This enables the seamless misattribution of harmful content, such as disinformation, to reputable sources. The key to our attack is repurposing watermark radioactivity, the unintended inheritance of data patterns during fine-tuning, from a discoverable trait into an attack vector. By distilling knowledge from a watermarked teacher model, our framework allows an attacker to steal and replicate the watermarking signal of the victim model. This work reveals a critical security gap in text authorship verification and calls for a paradigm shift towards technologies capable of distinguishing authentic watermarks from expertly imitated ones.

Abstract: With the recent emergence of revolutionary autonomous agentic systems, research community is witnessing a significant shift from traditional static, passive, and domain-specific AI agents toward more dynamic, proactive, and generalizable agentic AI. Motivated by the growing interest in agentic AI and its potential trajectory toward AGI, we present a comprehensive survey on Agentic Multimodal Large Language Models (Agentic MLLMs). In this survey, we explore the emerging paradigm of agentic MLLMs, delineating their conceptual foundations and distinguishing characteristics from conventional MLLM-based agents. We establish a conceptual framework that organizes agentic MLLMs along three fundamental dimensions: (i) Agentic internal intelligence functions as the system's commander, enabling accurate long-horizon planning through reasoning, reflection, and memory; (ii) Agentic external tool invocation, whereby models proactively use various external tools to extend their problem-solving capabilities beyond their intrinsic knowledge; and (iii) Agentic environment interaction further situates models within virtual or physical environments, allowing them to take actions, adapt strategies, and sustain goal-directed behavior in dynamic real-world scenarios. To further accelerate research in this area for the community, we compile open-source training frameworks, training and evaluation datasets for developing agentic MLLMs. Finally, we review the downstream applications of agentic MLLMs and outline future research directions for this rapidly evolving field. To continuously track developments in this rapidly evolving field, we will also actively update a public repository at https://github.com/HJYao00/Awesome-Agentic-MLLMs.

Abstract: Deep research frameworks have shown promising capabilities in synthesizing comprehensive reports from web sources. While deep research possesses significant potential to address complex issues through planning and research cycles, existing frameworks are deficient in sufficient evaluation procedures and stage-specific protections. They typically treat evaluation as exact match accuracy of question-answering, but overlook crucial aspects of report quality such as credibility, coherence, breadth, depth, and safety. This oversight may result in hazardous or malicious sources being integrated into the final report. To address these issues, we introduce DEEPRESEARCHGUARD, a comprehensive framework featuring four-stage safeguards with open-domain evaluation of references and reports. We assess performance across multiple metrics, e.g., defense success rate and over-refusal rate, and five key report dimensions. In the absence of a suitable safety benchmark, we introduce DRSAFEBENCH, a stage-wise benchmark for deep research safety. Our evaluation spans diverse state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-flash, DeepSeek-v3, and o4-mini. DEEPRESEARCHGUARD achieves an average defense success rate improvement of 18.16% while reducing over-refusal rate by 6%. The input guard provides the most substantial early-stage protection by filtering out obvious risks, while the plan and research guards enhance citation discipline and source credibility. Through extensive experiments, we show that DEEPRESEARCHGUARD enables comprehensive open-domain evaluation and stage-aware defenses that effectively block harmful content propagation, while systematically improving report quality without excessive over-refusal rates.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly under scrutiny for perpetuating identity-based discrimination in high-stakes domains such as hiring, particularly against people with disabilities (PwD). However, existing research remains largely Western-centric, overlooking how intersecting forms of marginalization--such as gender and caste--shape experiences of PwD in the Global South. We conduct a comprehensive audit of six LLMs across 2,820 hiring scenarios spanning diverse disability, gender, nationality, and caste profiles. To capture subtle intersectional harms and biases, we introduce ABLEIST (Ableism, Inspiration, Superhumanization, and Tokenism), a set of five ableism-specific and three intersectional harm metrics grounded in disability studies literature. Our results reveal significant increases in ABLEIST harms towards disabled candidates--harms that many state-of-the-art models failed to detect. These harms were further amplified by sharp increases in intersectional harms (e.g., Tokenism) for gender and caste-marginalized disabled candidates, highlighting critical blind spots in current safety tools and the need for intersectional safety evaluations of frontier models in high-stakes domains like hiring.

Abstract: We introduce Dynamic Nested Depth (DND), a novel method that improves performance for off-the-shelf LLMs by selecting critical tokens to reprocess in a nested depth manner. Specifically, at the end of the given transformer layer, DND identifies more critical tokens with a router and feeds them back for an extra round of processing, effectively ``reviewing" difficult tokens while avoiding redundant computation for easier ones. The dynamic selection mechanism is tailored for precise control via two novel strategies: a router controlling loss to enhance token selection distinguishability, and a threshold control scheme to ensure selection stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DND by directly integrating it into pre-trained dense and MoE models during a post-training phase. On diverse benchmarks, this approach boosts the performances of the dense Qwen3-1.7B by 1.88% and the MoE Qwen3-30B-A3B by 0.87%, all with a minimal parameter and computing increase.

Abstract: We introduce $\textbf{MASSE}$, the first Multi-Agent System for Structural Engineering, effectively integrating large language model (LLM)-based agents with real-world engineering workflows. Structural engineering is a fundamental yet traditionally stagnant domain, with core workflows remaining largely unchanged for decades despite its substantial economic impact and global market size. Recent advancements in LLMs have significantly enhanced their ability to perform complex reasoning, long-horizon planning, and precise tool utilization -- capabilities well aligned with structural engineering tasks such as interpreting design codes, executing load calculations, and verifying structural capacities. We present a proof-of-concept showing that most real-world structural engineering workflows can be fully automated through a training-free LLM-based multi-agent system. MASSE enables immediate deployment in professional environments, and our comprehensive validation on real-world case studies demonstrates that it can reduce expert workload from approximately two hours to mere minutes, while enhancing both reliability and accuracy in practical engineering scenarios.

Abstract: Priors are vital for planning under partial observability, yet difficult to obtain in practice. We present a sampling-based pipeline that leverages large-scale pretrained generative models to produce probabilistic priors capturing environmental uncertainty and spatio-semantic relationships in a zero-shot manner. Conditioned on partial observations, the pipeline recovers complete RGB-D point cloud samples with occupancy and target semantics, formulated to be directly useful in configuration-space planning. We establish a Matterport3D benchmark of rooms partially visible through doorways, where a robot must navigate to an unobserved target object. Effective priors for this setting must represent both occupancy and target-location uncertainty in unobserved regions. Experiments show that our approach recovers commonsense spatial semantics consistent with ground truth, yielding diverse, clean 3D point clouds usable in motion planning, highlight the promise of generative models as a rich source of priors for robotic planning.

<title>GeoVLMath: Enhancing Geometry Reasoning in Vision-Language Models via Cross-Modal Reward for Auxiliary Line Creation</title>

Abstract: Auxiliary lines are essential for solving complex geometric problems but remain challenging for large vision-language models (LVLMs). Rather than editing diagrams to draw auxiliary lines, which current image editing models struggle to render with geometric precision, we generate textual descriptions of auxiliary-line constructions to better align with the representational strengths of LVLMs. To bridge the gap between textual descriptions and spatial structure, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that enhances diagram-text alignment. At the core of our approach is a cross-modal reward that evaluates how well the generated auxiliary-line description for an original diagram matches a ground-truth auxiliary-line diagram. Built on this reward, we present GeoVLMath, an open-source LVLM tailored to auxiliary-line reasoning in solid geometry. This fine-grained signal drives a GRPO-based RL stage, yielding precise diagram-text alignment. To support training, we develop a scalable data creation pipeline and construct AuxSolidMath, a dataset of 3,018 real-exam geometry problems with paired diagrams and aligned textual fields. At the 3B and 7B scales, GeoVLMath achieves competitive and often superior performance compared with strong open-source and proprietary LVLMs on auxiliary-line reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Most robotic grasping methods are typically designed for single gripper types, which limits their applicability in real-world scenarios requiring diverse end-effectors. We propose XGrasp, a real-time gripper-aware grasp detection framework that efficiently handles multiple gripper configurations. The proposed method addresses data scarcity by systematically augmenting existing datasets with multi-gripper annotations. XGrasp employs a hierarchical two-stage architecture. In the first stage, a Grasp Point Predictor (GPP) identifies optimal locations using global scene information and gripper specifications. In the second stage, an Angle-Width Predictor (AWP) refines the grasp angle and width using local features. Contrastive learning in the AWP module enables zero-shot generalization to unseen grippers by learning fundamental grasping characteristics. The modular framework integrates seamlessly with vision foundation models, providing pathways for future vision-language capabilities. The experimental results demonstrate competitive grasp success rates across various gripper types, while achieving substantial improvements in inference speed compared to existing gripper-aware methods.

<title>From Reasoning LLMs to BERT: A Two-Stage Distillation Framework for Search Relevance</title>

Abstract: Query-service relevance prediction in e-commerce search systems faces strict latency requirements that prevent the direct application of Large Language Models (LLMs). To bridge this gap, we propose a two-stage reasoning distillation framework to transfer reasoning capabilities from a powerful teacher LLM to a lightweight, deployment-friendly student model. In the first stage, we address the limitations of general-purpose LLMs by constructing a domain-adapted teacher model. This is achieved through a three-step process: domain-adaptive pre-training to inject platform knowledge, supervised fine-tuning to elicit reasoning skills, and preference optimization with a multi-dimensional reward model to ensure the generation of reliable and preference-aligned reasoning paths. This teacher can then automatically annotate massive query-service pairs from search logs with both relevance labels and reasoning chains. In the second stage, to address the challenges of architectural heterogeneity in standard distillation, we introduce Contrastive Reasoning Self-Distillation (CRSD). By modeling the behavior of the same student model under "standard" and "reasoning-augmented" inputs as a teacher-student relationship, CRSD enables the lightweight model to internalize the teacher's complex decision-making mechanisms without needing the explicit reasoning path at inference. Offline evaluations and online A/B testing in the Meituan search advertising system demonstrate that our framework achieves significant improvements across multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness and practical value.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success as generative models. However, even a well-trained model can accumulate errors throughout the generation process. These errors become particularly problematic when arbitrary guidance is applied to steer samples toward desired properties, which often breaks sample fidelity. In this paper, we propose a general solution to address the off-manifold phenomenon observed in diffusion models. Our approach leverages a time predictor to estimate deviations from the desired data manifold at each timestep, identifying that a larger time gap is associated with reduced generation quality. We then design a novel guidance mechanism, `Temporal Alignment Guidance' (TAG), attracting the samples back to the desired manifold at every timestep during generation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that TAG consistently produces samples closely aligned with the desired manifold at each timestep, leading to significant improvements in generation quality across various downstream tasks.

Abstract: Deploying humanoid robots to interact with real-world environments--such as carrying objects or sitting on chairs--requires generalizable, lifelike motions and robust scene perception. Although prior approaches have advanced each capability individually, combining them in a unified system is still an ongoing challenge. In this work, we present a physical-world humanoid-scene interaction system, PhysHSI, that enables humanoids to autonomously perform diverse interaction tasks while maintaining natural and lifelike behaviors. PhysHSI comprises a simulation training pipeline and a real-world deployment system. In simulation, we adopt adversarial motion prior-based policy learning to imitate natural humanoid-scene interaction data across diverse scenarios, achieving both generalization and lifelike behaviors. For real-world deployment, we introduce a coarse-to-fine object localization module that combines LiDAR and camera inputs to provide continuous and robust scene perception. We validate PhysHSI on four representative interactive tasks--box carrying, sitting, lying, and standing up--in both simulation and real-world settings, demonstrating consistently high success rates, strong generalization across diverse task goals, and natural motion patterns.

Abstract: Modeling interactive driving behaviors in complex scenarios remains a fundamental challenge for autonomous driving planning. Learning-based approaches attempt to address this challenge with advanced generative models, removing the dependency on over-engineered architectures for representation fusion. However, brute-force implementation by simply stacking transformer blocks lacks a dedicated mechanism for modeling interactive behaviors that are common in real driving scenarios. The scarcity of interactive driving data further exacerbates this problem, leaving conventional imitation learning methods ill-equipped to capture high-value interactive behaviors. We propose Flow Planner, which tackles these problems through coordinated innovations in data modeling, model architecture, and learning scheme. Specifically, we first introduce fine-grained trajectory tokenization, which decomposes the trajectory into overlapping segments to decrease the complexity of whole trajectory modeling. With a sophisticatedly designed architecture, we achieve efficient temporal and spatial fusion of planning and scene information, to better capture interactive behaviors. In addition, the framework incorporates flow matching with classifier-free guidance for multi-modal behavior generation, which dynamically reweights agent interactions during inference to maintain coherent response strategies, providing a critical boost for interactive scenario understanding. Experimental results on the large-scale nuPlan dataset and challenging interactive interPlan dataset demonstrate that Flow Planner achieves state-of-the-art performance among learning-based approaches while effectively modeling interactive behaviors in complex driving scenarios.

Abstract: Disentangling complex causal relationships is important for accurate detection of anomalies. In multivariate time series analysis, dynamic interactions among data variables over time complicate the interpretation of causal relationships. Traditional approaches assume statistical independence between variables in unsupervised settings, whereas recent methods capture feature correlations through graph representation learning. However, their representations fail to explicitly infer the causal relationships over different time periods. To solve the problem, we propose Causally Disentangled Representation Learning for Anomaly Detection (CDRL4AD) to detect anomalies and identify their causal relationships in multivariate time series. First, we design the causal process as model input, the temporal heterogeneous graph, and causal relationships. Second, our representation identifies causal relationships over different time periods and disentangles latent variables to infer the corresponding causal factors. Third, our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that CDRL4AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and root cause analysis. Fourth, our model analysis validates hyperparameter sensitivity and the time complexity of CDRL4AD. Last, we conduct a case study to show how our approach assists human experts in diagnosing the root causes of anomalies.

Abstract: Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) enables knowledge transfer from a source domain to an unsupervised target domain for object detection without access to source data. Most existing SFOD approaches are either confined to conventional object detection (OD) models like Faster R-CNN or designed as general solutions without tailored adaptations for novel OD architectures, especially Detection Transformer (DETR). In this paper, we introduce Feature Reweighting ANd Contrastive Learning NetworK (FRANCK), a novel SFOD framework specifically designed to perform query-centric feature enhancement for DETRs. FRANCK comprises four key components: (1) an Objectness Score-based Sample Reweighting (OSSR) module that computes attention-based objectness scores on multi-scale encoder feature maps, reweighting the detection loss to emphasize less-recognized regions; (2) a Contrastive Learning with Matching-based Memory Bank (CMMB) module that integrates multi-level features into memory banks, enhancing class-wise contrastive learning; (3) an Uncertainty-weighted Query-fused Feature Distillation (UQFD) module that improves feature distillation through prediction quality reweighting and query feature fusion; and (4) an improved self-training pipeline with a Dynamic Teacher Updating Interval (DTUI) that optimizes pseudo-label quality. By leveraging these components, FRANCK effectively adapts a source-pre-trained DETR model to a target domain with enhanced robustness and generalization. Extensive experiments on several widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its effectiveness and compatibility with DETR-based SFOD models.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Computer-Aided Design(CAD) drawings in engineering, architecture, and industrial design, the ability to accurately interpret and analyze these drawings has become increasingly critical. Among various subtasks, panoptic symbol spotting plays a vital role in enabling downstream applications such as CAD automation and design retrieval. Existing methods primarily focus on geometric primitives within the CAD drawings to address this task, but they face following major problems: they usually overlook the rich textual annotations present in CAD drawings and they lack explicit modeling of relationships among primitives, resulting in incomprehensive understanding of the holistic drawings. To fill this gap, we propose a panoptic symbol spotting framework that incorporates textual annotations. The framework constructs unified representations by jointly modeling geometric and textual primitives. Then, using visual features extract by pretrained CNN as the initial representations, a Transformer-based backbone is employed, enhanced with a type-aware attention mechanism to explicitly model the different types of spatial dependencies between various primitives. Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on symbol spotting tasks involving textual annotations, and exhibits superior robustness when applied to complex CAD drawings.

Abstract: Click-through rate (CTR) prediction, which models behavior sequence and non-sequential features (e.g., user/item profiles or cross features) to infer user interest, underpins industrial recommender systems. However, most methods face three forms of heterogeneity that degrade predictive performance: (i) Feature Heterogeneity persists when limited sequence side features provide less granular interest representation compared to extensive non-sequential features, thereby impairing sequence modeling performance; (ii) Context Heterogeneity arises because a user's interest in an item will be influenced by other items, yet point-wise prediction neglects cross-item interaction context from the entire item set; (iii) Architecture Heterogeneity stems from the fragmented integration of specialized network modules, which compounds the model's effectiveness, efficiency and scalability in industrial deployments. To tackle the above limitations, we propose HoMer, a Homogeneous-Oriented TransforMer for modeling sequential and set-wise contexts. First, we align sequence side features with non-sequential features for accurate sequence modeling and fine-grained interest representation. Second, we shift the prediction paradigm from point-wise to set-wise, facilitating cross-item interaction in a highly parallel manner. Third, HoMer's unified encoder-decoder architecture achieves dual optimization through structural simplification and shared computation, ensuring computational efficiency while maintaining scalability with model size. Without arduous modification to the prediction pipeline, HoMer successfully scales up and outperforms our industrial baseline by 0.0099 in the AUC metric, and enhances online business metrics like CTR/RPM by 1.99%/2.46%. Additionally, HoMer saves 27% of GPU resources via preliminary engineering optimization, further validating its superiority and practicality.

Abstract: Many robotic control tasks require policies to act on orientations, yet the geometry of SO(3) makes this nontrivial. Because SO(3) admits no global, smooth, minimal parameterization, common representations such as Euler angles, quaternions, rotation matrices, and Lie algebra coordinates introduce distinct constraints and failure modes. While these trade-offs are well studied for supervised learning, their implications for actions in reinforcement learning remain unclear. We systematically evaluate SO(3) action representations across three standard continuous control algorithms, PPO, SAC, and TD3, under dense and sparse rewards. We compare how representations shape exploration, interact with entropy regularization, and affect training stability through empirical studies and analyze the implications of different projections for obtaining valid rotations from Euclidean network outputs. Across a suite of robotics benchmarks, we quantify the practical impact of these choices and distill simple, implementation-ready guidelines for selecting and using rotation actions. Our results highlight that representation-induced geometry strongly influences exploration and optimization and show that representing actions as tangent vectors in the local frame yields the most reliable results across algorithms.

Abstract: Current approaches for strengthening LLM reasoning tend to introduce a training bias toward human-like reasoning trajectories. In step-wise preference optimization, in particular, dependence on human or higher-capacity model annotations for intermediate steps limits exploration of alternative, non-human-like reasoning paths and thus constrains achievable performance. Furthermore, through a small-scale pilot study, we observed that in approximately 75% of cases, the model's first erroneous step occurs after the lowest-confidence point. This suggests that guiding the model at its lowest-confidence point before an error provides more accurate supervision than locating the first explicit error. In this paper, we propose Confidence-Guided Reasoning Path Preference Optimization (CGPO), a method that leverages a confidence signal to identify points of maximal uncertainty in the model's reasoning process and applies self-generated, non-human-like reasoning-path guidance to mitigate trajectory drift. Our experiments span diverse models applied to both code and mathematical reasoning tasks. The results show that, with the same amount of training data, our method using data generated by a small model can achieve better performance in most cases compared with approaches using data generated by a strong model or human-annotated.

Abstract: The autonomy and contextual complexity of LLM-based agents render traditional access control (AC) mechanisms insufficient. Static, rule-based systems designed for predictable environments are fundamentally ill-equipped to manage the dynamic information flows inherent in agentic interactions. This position paper argues for a paradigm shift from binary access control to a more sophisticated model of information governance, positing that the core challenge is not merely about permission, but about governing the flow of information. We introduce Agent Access Control (AAC), a novel framework that reframes AC as a dynamic, context-aware process of information flow governance. AAC operates on two core modules: (1) multi-dimensional contextual evaluation, which assesses not just identity but also relationships, scenarios, and norms; and (2) adaptive response formulation, which moves beyond simple allow/deny decisions to shape information through redaction, summarization, and paraphrasing. This vision, powered by a dedicated AC reasoning engine, aims to bridge the gap between human-like nuanced judgment and scalable Al safety, proposing a new conceptual lens for future research in trustworthy agent design.

Abstract: Missing or corrupted modalities are common in physiological signal-based medical applications owing to hardware constraints or motion artifacts. However, most existing methods assume the availability of all modalities, resulting in substantial performance degradation in the absence of any modality. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes PhysioME, a robust framework designed to ensure reliable performance under missing modality conditions. PhysioME adopts: (1) a multimodal self-supervised learning approach that combines contrastive learning with masked prediction; (2) a Dual-PathNeuroNet backbone tailored to capture the temporal dynamics of each physiological signal modality; and (3) a restoration decoder that reconstructs missing modality tokens, enabling flexible processing of incomplete inputs. The experimental results show that PhysioME achieves high consistency and generalization performance across various missing modality scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of PhysioME as a reliable tool for supporting clinical decision-making in real-world settings with imperfect data availability.

Abstract: Continuous, high-frame-rate, high-resolution processing of long video streams is critical for future AI agents, yet current video-understanding LLMs struggle to scale. Offline, fixed-frame-number methods require the stream length to adapt frame rates; streaming methods constrain memory by merging or discarding tokens, losing information. We propose video-SALMONN S, a streaming audio-visual LLM that, to our knowledge, is the first to process 3-hour videos at 1 FPS and 360p resolution under a fixed memory budget. Our model introduces (i) a test-time-training (TTT) memory module that continually updates token representations to capture long-range dependencies by replacing token merging, and (ii) a prompt-dependent memory reader that selectively retrieves context-relevant content from fixed-size memory. The TTT module is optimised with a Hessian-free conjugate-gradient procedure (TTT_HF) for efficient adaptation. On long-video benchmarks (Video-MME, LVBench, VideoEvalPro), video-SALMONN S sustains high-quality understanding on multi-hour videos with 10k frames and 1M tokens. Our 8B-parameter model achieves 74.2% overall and 67.8% on the Video-MME long split, outperforming both offline and streaming baselines.

Abstract: Distance-based unsupervised text classification is a method within text classification that leverages the semantic similarity between a label and a text to determine label relevance. This method provides numerous benefits, including fast inference and adaptability to expanding label sets, as opposed to zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned neural networks that require re-training in such cases. In multi-label distance-based classification and information retrieval algorithms, thresholds are required to determine whether a text instance is "similar" to a label or query. Similarity between a text and label is determined in a dense embedding space, usually generated by state-of-the-art sentence encoders. Multi-label classification complicates matters, as a text instance can have multiple true labels, unlike in multi-class or binary classification, where each instance is assigned only one label. We expand upon previous literature on this underexplored topic by thoroughly examining and evaluating the ability of sentence encoders to perform distance-based classification. First, we perform an exploratory study to verify whether the semantic relationships between texts and labels vary across models, datasets, and label sets by conducting experiments on a diverse collection of realistic multi-label text classification (MLTC) datasets. We find that similarity distributions show statistically significant differences across models, datasets and even label sets. We propose a novel method for optimizing label-specific thresholds using a validation set. Our label-specific thresholding method achieves an average improvement of 46% over normalized 0.5 thresholding and outperforms uniform thresholding approaches from previous work by an average of 14%. Additionally, the method demonstrates strong performance even with limited labeled examples.

Abstract: With the rise of reasoning language models and test-time scaling methods as a paradigm for improving model performance, substantial computation is often required to generate multiple candidate sequences from the same prompt. This enables exploration of different reasoning paths toward the correct solution, however, allocates the same compute budget for each prompt. Grounded on the assumption that different prompts carry different degrees of complexity, and thus different computation needs, we propose EAGer, a training-free generation method that leverages model uncertainty through token-wise entropy distribution to reduce redundant computation and concurrently improve overall performance. EAGer allows branching to multiple reasoning paths only in the presence of high-entropy tokens, and then reallocates the saved compute budget to the instances where exploration of alternative paths is most needed. We find that across multiple open-source models on complex reasoning benchmarks such as AIME 2025, EAGer can reallocate the budget without accessing target labels, achieving the best efficiency-performance trade-off in terms of reasoning length and Pass@k. When target labels are accessible, EAGer generates up to 65% fewer tokens (hence saving compute) and achieves up to 37% improvement in Pass@k compared to the Full Parallel Sampling.

<title>G2L:From Giga-Scale to Cancer-Specific Large-Scale Pathology Foundation Models via Knowledge Distillation</title>

Abstract: Recent studies in pathology foundation models have shown that scaling training data, diversifying cancer types, and increasing model size consistently improve their performance. However, giga-scale foundation models, which are trained on hundreds of thousands of slides covering tens of cancer types and contain billions of parameters, pose significant challenges for practical use due to their tremendous computational costs in both development and deployment. In this work, we present a novel strategy, named the G2L framework, to increase the performance of large-scale foundation models, which consist of only $15\%$ of the parameters of giga-scale models, to a comparable performance level of giga-scale models in cancer-specific tasks. Our approach applies knowledge distillation, transferring the capabilities of a giga-scale model to a large-scale model, using just 1K pathology slides of a target cancer (e.g., breast, prostate, etc.). The resulting distilled model not only outperformed state-of-the-art models of the same size (i.e., large-scale) across several benchmarks but also, interestingly, surpassed the giga-scale teacher and huge-scale models in some benchmarks. In addition, the distilled model exhibited a higher robustness index, indicating improved resilience to image variations originating from multiple institutions. These findings suggest that the proposed distillation approach for a large-scale model is a data- and parameter-efficient way to achieve giga-scale-level performance for cancer-specific applications without prohibitive computational burden.

Abstract: Deep learning is expected to aid pathologists by automating tasks such as tumour segmentation. We aimed to develop one universal tumour segmentation model for histopathological images and examine its performance in different cancer types. The model was developed using over 20 000 whole-slide images from over 4 000 patients with colorectal, endometrial, lung, or prostate carcinoma. Performance was validated in pre-planned analyses on external cohorts with over 3 000 patients across six cancer types. Exploratory analyses included over 1 500 additional patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Average Dice coefficient was over 80% in all validation cohorts with en bloc resection specimens and in The Cancer Genome Atlas cohorts. No loss of performance was observed when comparing the universal model with models specialised on single cancer types. In conclusion, extensive and rigorous evaluations demonstrate that generic tumour segmentation by a single model is possible across cancer types, patient populations, sample preparations, and slide scanners.

Abstract: Deciphering the function of unseen protein sequences is a fundamental challenge with broad scientific impact, yet most existing methods depend on task-specific adapters or large-scale supervised fine-tuning. We introduce the "Protein-as-Second-Language" framework, which reformulates amino-acid sequences as sentences in a novel symbolic language that large language models can interpret through contextual exemplars. Our approach adaptively constructs sequence-question-answer triples that reveal functional cues in a zero-shot setting, without any further training. To support this process, we curate a bilingual corpus of 79,926 protein-QA instances spanning attribute prediction, descriptive understanding, and extended reasoning. Empirically, our method delivers consistent gains across diverse open-source LLMs and GPT-4, achieving up to 17.2% ROUGE-L improvement (average +7%) and even surpassing fine-tuned protein-specific language models. These results highlight that generic LLMs, when guided with protein-as-language cues, can outperform domain-specialized models, offering a scalable pathway for protein understanding in foundation models.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) increases the reliability and trustworthiness of the LLM response and reduces hallucination by eliminating the need for model retraining. It does so by adding external data into the LLM's context. We develop a new class of black-box attack, RAG-Pull, that inserts hidden UTF characters into queries or external code repositories, redirecting retrieval toward malicious code, thereby breaking the models' safety alignment. We observe that query and code perturbations alone can shift retrieval toward attacker-controlled snippets, while combined query-and-target perturbations achieve near-perfect success. Once retrieved, these snippets introduce exploitable vulnerabilities such as remote code execution and SQL injection. RAG-Pull's minimal perturbations can alter the model's safety alignment and increase preference towards unsafe code, therefore opening up a new class of attacks on LLMs.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the language understanding and reasoning power of large language models (LLMs) with external retrieval to enable domain-grounded responses. Effectively adapting RAG systems to domain-specific settings requires specialized, context-rich training data beyond general-purpose question-answering. Here, we propose RAGen, a scalable and modular framework for generating domain-grounded question-answer-context (QAC) triples tailored to diverse RAG adaptation approaches. RAGen produces these QAC triples by identifying key concepts in documents, generating diverse questions guided by Bloom's Taxonomy-inspired principles, and pairing them with precise answers extracted from relevant contexts. RAGen supports multiple RAG adaptation strategies, including the optimization of key components such as the LLM, retriever, and embedding model, etc. Its modular pipeline features semantic chunking, hierarchical concept extraction, and multi-chunk retrieval, along with the introduction of curated distractor contexts to promote robust reasoning. Designed for scalability, RAGen efficiently handles large and evolving document corpora without redundant processing, making it especially suitable for dynamic evolving domains such as scientific research and enterprise knowledge bases.

<title>The Curious Case of Factual (Mis)Alignment between LLMs' Short- and Long-Form Answers</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can correctly answer "When was Einstein born?" yet fail to provide the same date when writing about Einstein's life revealing a fundamental inconsistency in how models access factual knowledge across task complexities. While models display impressive accuracy on factual question-answering benchmarks, the reliability gap between simple and complex queries remains poorly understood, eroding their trustworthiness. In this work, we introduce Short-Long Form Alignment for Factual Question Answering (SLAQ), a controlled evaluation framework that compares LLMs' answers to the same factual questions asked (a) in isolation (short) vs. (b) integrated into complex queries (long). Looking at 16 LLMs across 600 queries, we find a systematic misalignment of answers to the corresponding short and long queries. We further uncover position-dependent accuracy loss and momentum effects where consecutive correct or incorrect answers create self-reinforcing patterns. Through mechanistic analysis, we find that aligned facts activate overlapping model internals, and that metrics based on mechanistic similarity can predict short-long answer alignment with up to 78% accuracy. Our work establishes factual consistency over query complexity as an important aspect of LLMs' trustworthiness and challenges current evaluation practices, which implicitly assume that good performance for simple factual queries implies reliability in more complex knowledge-seeking tasks too.

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in natural language processing for moral sentiment classification is challenging, particularly under cross-domain shifts where transformer models are increasingly deployed. Using the Moral Foundations Twitter Corpus (MFTC) and Moral Foundations Reddit Corpus (MFRC), this work evaluates BERT and DistilBERT in a multi-label setting with in-domain and cross-domain protocols. Aggregate performance can mask disparities: we observe pronounced asymmetry in transfer, with Twitter->Reddit degrading micro-F1 by 14.9% versus only 1.5% for Reddit->Twitter. Per-label analysis reveals fairness violations hidden by overall scores; notably, the authority label exhibits Demographic Parity Differences of 0.22-0.23 and Equalized Odds Differences of 0.40-0.41. To address this gap, we introduce the Moral Fairness Consistency (MFC) metric, which quantifies the cross-domain stability of moral foundation detection. MFC shows strong empirical validity, achieving a perfect negative correlation with Demographic Parity Difference (rho = -1.000, p < 0.001) while remaining independent of standard performance metrics. Across labels, loyalty demonstrates the highest consistency (MFC = 0.96) and authority the lowest (MFC = 0.78). These findings establish MFC as a complementary, diagnosis-oriented metric for fairness-aware evaluation of moral reasoning models, enabling more reliable deployment across heterogeneous linguistic contexts. .

Abstract: Effective pneumonia diagnosis is often challenged by the difficulty of deploying large, computationally expensive deep learning models in resource-limited settings. This study introduces LightPneumoNet, an efficient, lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) built from scratch to provide an accessible and accurate diagnostic solution for pneumonia detection from chest X-rays. Our model was trained on a public dataset of 5,856 chest X-ray images. Preprocessing included image resizing to 224x224, grayscale conversion, and pixel normalization, with data augmentation (rotation, zoom, shear) to prevent overfitting. The custom architecture features four blocks of stacked convolutional layers and contains only 388,082 trainable parameters, resulting in a minimal 1.48 MB memory footprint. On the independent test set, our model delivered exceptional performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 0.942, precision of 0.92, and an F1-Score of 0.96. Critically, it obtained a sensitivity (recall) of 0.99, demonstrating a near-perfect ability to identify true pneumonia cases and minimize clinically significant false negatives. Notably, LightPneumoNet achieves this high recall on the same dataset where existing approaches typically require significantly heavier architectures or fail to reach comparable sensitivity levels. The model's efficiency enables deployment on low-cost hardware, making advanced computer-aided diagnosis accessible in underserved clinics and serving as a reliable second-opinion tool to improve patient outcomes.

Abstract: When AI agents retrieve and reason over external documents, adversaries can manipulate the data they receive to subvert their behaviour. Previous research has studied indirect prompt injection, where the attacker injects malicious instructions. We argue that injection of instructions is not necessary to manipulate agents - attackers could instead supply biased, misleading, or false information. We term this an attack by content. Existing defenses, which focus on detecting hidden commands, are ineffective against attacks by content. To defend themselves and their users, agents must critically evaluate retrieved information, corroborating claims with external evidence and evaluating source trustworthiness. We argue that this is analogous to an existing NLP task, automated fact-checking, which we propose to repurpose as a cognitive self-defense tool for agents.

Abstract: Sign languages serve as essential communication systems for individuals with hearing and speech impairments. However, digital linguistic dataset resources for underrepresented sign languages, such as Nepali Sign Language (NSL), remain scarce. This study introduces the first benchmark dataset for NSL, consisting of 36 gesture classes with 1,500 samples per class, designed to capture the structural and visual features of the language. To evaluate recognition performance, we fine-tuned MobileNetV2 and ResNet50 architectures on the dataset, achieving classification accuracies of 90.45% and 88.78%, respectively. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks in sign recognition tasks, particularly within low-resource settings. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first systematic effort to construct a benchmark dataset and assess deep learning approaches for NSL recognition, highlighting the potential of transfer learning and fine-tuning for advancing research in underexplored sign languages.

Abstract: The widespread use of large language models (LLMs) and open-source code has raised ethical and security concerns regarding the distribution and attribution of source code, including unauthorized redistribution, license violations, and misuse of code for malicious purposes. Watermarking has emerged as a promising solution for source attribution, but existing techniques rely heavily on hand-crafted transformation rules, abstract syntax tree (AST) manipulation, or task-specific training, limiting their scalability and generality across languages. Moreover, their robustness against attacks remains limited. To address these limitations, we propose CodeMark-LLM, an LLM-driven watermarking framework that embeds watermark into source code without compromising its semantics or readability. CodeMark-LLM consists of two core components: (i) Semantically Consistent Embedding module that applies functionality-preserving transformations to encode watermark bits, and (ii) Differential Comparison Extraction module that identifies the applied transformations by comparing the original and watermarked code. Leveraging the cross-lingual generalization ability of LLM, CodeMark-LLM avoids language-specific engineering and training pipelines. Extensive experiments across diverse programming languages and attack scenarios demonstrate its robustness, effectiveness, and scalability.

Abstract: Microscopic characterizations, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), are widely used in scientific research for visualizing and analyzing microstructures. Determining the scale bars is an important first step of accurate SEM analysis; however, currently, it mainly relies on manual operations, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this issue, we propose a multi-modal and automated scale bar detection and extraction framework that provides concurrent object detection, text detection and text recognition with a Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The proposed framework operates in four phases; i) Automatic Dataset Generation (Auto-DG) model to synthesize a diverse dataset of SEM images ensuring robust training and high generalizability of the model, ii) scale bar object detection, iii) information extraction using a hybrid Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system with DenseNet and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) based algorithms, iv) an LLM agent to analyze and verify accuracy of the results. The proposed model demonstrates a strong performance in object detection and accurate localization with a precision of 100%, recall of 95.8%, and a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 99.2% at IoU=0.5 and 69.1% at IoU=0.5:0.95. The hybrid OCR system achieved 89% precision, 65% recall, and a 75% F1 score on the Auto-DG dataset, significantly outperforming several mainstream standalone engines, highlighting its reliability for scientific image analysis. The LLM is introduced as a reasoning engine as well as an intelligent assistant that suggests follow-up steps and verifies the results. This automated method powered by an LLM agent significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of scale bar detection and extraction in SEM images, providing a valuable tool for microscopic analysis and advancing the field of scientific imaging.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) chatbots are now pervasive in digital ecosystems, yet their network traffic remains largely underexplored. This study presents an in-depth investigation of traffic generated by three leading chatbots (ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini) when accessed via Android mobile apps for both text and image generation. Using a dedicated capture architecture, we collect and label two complementary workloads: a 60-hour generic dataset with unconstrained prompts, and a controlled dataset built from identical prompts across GenAI apps and replicated via conventional messaging apps to enable one-to-one comparisons. This dual design allows us to address practical research questions on the distinctiveness of GenAI traffic, its differences from widely deployed traffic categories, and its novel implications for network usage. To this end, we provide fine-grained traffic characterization at trace, flow, and protocol levels, and model packet-sequence dynamics with Multimodal Markov Chains. Our analyses reveal app- and content-specific traffic patterns, particularly in volume, uplink/downlink profiles, and protocol adoption. We highlight the predominance of TLS, with Gemini extensively leveraging QUIC, ChatGPT exclusively using TLS 1.3, and app- and content-specific Server Name Indication (SNI) values. A payload-based occlusion analysis quantifies SNI's contribution to classification: masking it reduces F1-score by up to 20 percentage points in GenAI app traffic classification. Finally, compared with conventional messaging apps when carrying the same content, GenAI chatbots exhibit unique traffic characteristics, highlighting new stress factors for mobile networks, such as sustained upstream activity, with direct implications for network monitoring and management. We publicly release the datasets to support reproducibility and foster extensions to other use cases.

<title>Towards Real-Time Fake News Detection under Evidence Scarcity</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11277</link>

Abstract: Fake news detection becomes particularly challenging in real-time scenarios, where emerging events often lack sufficient supporting evidence. Existing approaches often rely heavily on external evidence and therefore struggle to generalize under evidence scarcity. To address this issue, we propose Evaluation-Aware Selection of Experts (EASE), a novel framework for real-time fake news detection that dynamically adapts its decision-making process according to the assessed sufficiency of available evidence. EASE introduces a sequential evaluation mechanism comprising three independent perspectives: (1) Evidence-based evaluation, which assesses evidence and incorporates it into decision-making only when the evidence is sufficiently supportive; (2) Reasoning-based evaluation, which leverages the world knowledge of large language models (LLMs) and applies them only when their reliability is adequately established; and (3) Sentiment-based fallback, which integrates sentiment cues when neither evidence nor reasoning is reliable. To enhance the accuracy of evaluation processes, EASE employs instruction tuning with pseudo labels to guide each evaluator in justifying its perspective-specific knowledge through interpretable reasoning. Furthermore, the expert modules integrate the evaluators' justified assessments with the news content to enable evaluation-aware decision-making, thereby enhancing overall detection accuracy. Moreover, we introduce RealTimeNews-25, a new benchmark comprising recent news for evaluating model generalization on emerging news with limited evidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EASE not only achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, but also significantly improves generalization to real-time news. The code and dataset are available: https://github.com/wgyhhhh/EASE.

Abstract: We present Entropic Mutual-Information Geometry Large-Language Model Alignment (ENIGMA), a novel approach to Large-Language Model (LLM) training that jointly improves reasoning, alignment and robustness by treating an organisation's policies/principles as directions to move on a model's information manifold. Our single-loop trainer combines Group-Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO), an on-policy, critic-free RL method with Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-format only rewards; a Self-Supervised Alignment with Mutual Information (SAMI)-style symmetric InfoNCE auxiliary; and an entropic Sinkhorn optimal-transport regulariser on hidden-state distributions to bound geometry drift. We also introduce infoNCE metrics that specialise to a standard MI lower bound under matched negatives to measure how strongly a model's CoT encodes these policies. These metrics include a Sufficiency Index (SI) that enables the selection and creation of principles that maximise downstream performance prior to training. In our experiments using small (1B) LLMs, high-SI principles predict steadier training dynamics and improved benchmark performance over GRPO ablations. Our information-geometry analysis of trained models validates desirable structural change in the manifold. These results support our hypothesis that reasoning, alignment, and robustness are projections of a single informationgeometric objective, and that models trained using ENIGMA demonstrate principled reasoning without the use of a reward model, offering a path to trusted capability

Abstract: While Key-Value (KV) cache succeeds in reducing redundant computations in auto-regressive models, it introduces significant memory overhead, limiting its practical deployment in long-sequence scenarios. Existing KV retrieval methods mitigate this by dynamically retaining only a subset of KV entries on the GPU. However, they still suffer from notable efficiency and accuracy bottlenecks due to per-token retrieval and coarse-grained page-level KV management, especially in long-output reasoning scenarios. With the emergence of large reasoning models, efficiently handling such scenarios has become increasingly important. To address this issue, we present two key observations: (1) critical KVs exhibit strong temporal locality during decoding, and (2) these KVs exhibit distinct distribution patterns across the input prompt and generated output. Building on these observations, we propose LouisKV, an efficient KV cache retrieval framework designed for various long-sequence scenarios. Specifically, LouisKV introduces a semantic-aware retrieval strategy leveraging temporal locality to trigger retrieval only at semantic boundaries, drastically reducing computation and data transfer overhead. LouisKV also designs a decoupled, fine-grained management scheme that tailors differentiated strategies for input and output sequences to create retrieval units that better match the model's attention patterns, enabling precise identification of critical KVs. Furthermore, to boost efficiency, LouisKV incorporates several kernel-level optimizations, including custom Triton and CUDA kernels to accelerate the KV clustering and retrieval. Evaluations show that LouisKV achieves up to 4.7$\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art KV retrieval methods while maintaining near-lossless accuracy across diverse long-sequence tasks, including long-input short-output, short-input long-output, and long-input long-output scenarios.

Abstract: This paper proposes an agent-based approach toward a more natural interface between humans and machines. Large language models equipped with tools and the communication standard OPC UA are utilized to control machines in natural language. Instead of touch interaction, which is currently the state-of-the-art medium for interaction in operations, the proposed approach enables operators to talk or text with machines. This allows commands such as 'Please decrease the temperature by 20 % in machine 1 and set the motor speed to 5000 rpm in machine 2.' The large language model receives the user input and selects one of three predefined tools that connect to an OPC UA server and either change or read the value of a node. Afterwards, the result of the tool execution is passed back to the language model, which then provides a final response to the user. The approach is universally designed and can therefore be applied to any machine that supports the OPC UA standard. The large language model is neither fine-tuned nor requires training data, only the relevant machine credentials and a parameter dictionary are included within the system prompt. The approach is evaluated on a Siemens S7-1500 programmable logic controller with four machine parameters in a case study of fifty synthetically generated commands on five different models. The results demonstrate high success rate, with proprietary GPT 5 models achieving accuracies between 96.0 % and 98.0 %, and open-weight models reaching up to 90.0 %. The proposed approach of this empirical study contributes to advancing natural interaction in industrial human-machine interfaces.

<title>When Does Supervised Training Pay Off? The Hidden Economics of Object Detection in the Era of Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Object detection systems have traditionally relied on supervised learning with manually annotated bounding boxes, achieving high accuracy at the cost of substantial annotation investment. The emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offers an alternative paradigm enabling zero-shot detection through natural language queries, eliminating annotation requirements but operating with reduced accuracy. This paper presents the first comprehensive cost-effectiveness analysis comparing supervised detection (YOLO) with zero-shot VLM inference (Gemini Flash 2.5). Through systematic evaluation on 1,000 stratified COCO images and 200 diverse product images spanning consumer electronics and rare categories, combined with detailed Total Cost of Ownership modeling, we establish quantitative break-even thresholds governing architecture selection. Our findings reveal that supervised YOLO achieves 91.2% accuracy versus 68.5% for zero-shot Gemini on standard categories, representing a 22.7 percentage point advantage that costs $10,800 in annotation for 100-category systems. However, this advantage justifies investment only beyond 55 million inferences, equivalent to 151,000 images daily for one year. Zero-shot Gemini demonstrates 52.3% accuracy on diverse product categories (ranging from highly web-prevalent consumer electronics at 75-85% to rare specialized equipment at 25-40%) where supervised YOLO achieves 0% due to architectural constraints preventing detection of untrained classes. Cost per Correct Detection analysis reveals substantially lower per-detection costs for Gemini ($0.00050 vs $0.143) at 100,000 inferences despite accuracy deficits. We develop decision frameworks demonstrating that optimal architecture selection depends critically on deployment volume, category stability, budget constraints, and accuracy requirements rather than purely technical performance metrics.

Abstract: Current approaches to embodied AI tend to learn policies from expert demonstrations. However, without a mechanism to evaluate the quality of demonstrated actions, they are limited to learning from optimal behaviour, or they risk replicating errors and inefficiencies. While reinforcement learning offers one alternative, the associated exploration typically results in sacrificing data efficiency. This work explores how agents trained with imitation learning can learn robust representations from both optimal and suboptimal demonstrations when given access to constructive language feedback as a means to contextualise different modes of behaviour. We directly provide language feedback embeddings as part of the input sequence into a Transformer-based policy, and optionally complement the traditional next action prediction objective with auxiliary self-supervised learning objectives for feedback prediction. We test our approach on a range of embodied Vision-and-Language tasks in our custom BabyAI-XGen environment and show significant improvements in agents' compositional generalisation abilities and robustness, suggesting that our data-efficient method allows models to successfully convert suboptimal behaviour into learning opportunities. Overall, our results suggest that language feedback is a competitive and intuitive alternative to intermediate scalar rewards for language-specified embodied tasks.

Abstract: As the demand for emotional intelligence in large language models (LLMs) grows, a key challenge lies in understanding the internal mechanisms that give rise to emotional expression and in controlling emotions in generated text. This study addresses three core questions: (1) Do LLMs contain context-agnostic mechanisms shaping emotional expression? (2) What form do these mechanisms take? (3) Can they be harnessed for universal emotion control? We first construct a controlled dataset, SEV (Scenario-Event with Valence), to elicit comparable internal states across emotions. Subsequently, we extract context-agnostic emotion directions that reveal consistent, cross-context encoding of emotion (Q1). We identify neurons and attention heads that locally implement emotional computation through analytical decomposition and causal analysis, and validate their causal roles via ablation and enhancement interventions. Next, we quantify each sublayer's causal influence on the model's final emotion representation and integrate the identified local components into coherent global emotion circuits that drive emotional expression (Q2). Directly modulating these circuits achieves 99.65% emotion-expression accuracy on the test set, surpassing prompting- and steering-based methods (Q3). To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study to uncover and validate emotion circuits in LLMs, offering new insights into interpretability and controllable emotional intelligence.

Abstract: Contrastive audio-language pretraining yields powerful joint representations, yet a persistent audio-text modality gap limits the benefits of coupling multimodal encoders with large language models (LLMs). We present Diffusion-Link, a diffusion-based modality-bridging module that generatively maps audio embeddings into the text-embedding distribution. The module is trained at the output embedding from the frozen multimodal encoder and implemented as a lightweight network with three residual MLP blocks. To assess the effect of Diffusion-Link on multimodal encoder-LLM coupling, we evaluate on Automatic Audio Captioning (AAC); to our knowledge, this is the first application of diffusion-based modality bridging to AAC. We report two results. (1) Modality-gap analysis: on similarity and geometric criteria, Diffusion-Link reduces the modality gap the most among prior diffusion-based methods and shows a collective migration of audio embeddings toward the text distribution. (2) Downstream AAC: attaching Diffusion-Link to the same multimodal LLM baseline achieves state-of-the-art on AudioCaps in both zero-shot and fully supervised captioning without external knowledge, with relative gains up to 52.5% and 7.5%, respectively. These findings show that closing the modality gap is pivotal for effective coupling between multimodal encoders and LLMs, and diffusion-based modality bridging offers a promising direction beyond knowledge-retrieval-centric designs.

Abstract: Real-world graph typically evolve via a series of events, modeling dynamic interactions between objects across various domains. For dynamic graph learning, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as popular solutions. Recently, prompt learning methods have been explored on dynamic graphs. However, existing methods generally focus on capturing the relationship between nodes and time, while overlooking the impact of historical events. In this paper, we propose EVP, an event-aware dynamic graph prompt learning framework that can serve as a plug-in to existing methods, enhancing their ability to leverage historical events knowledge. First, we extract a series of historical events for each node and introduce an event adaptation mechanism to align the fine-grained characteristics of these events with downstream tasks. Second, we propose an event aggregation mechanism to effectively integrate historical knowledge into node representations. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on four public datasets to evaluate and analyze EVP.

Abstract: Synchronous Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training has emerged as a crucial step for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse capabilities. However, many systems designed to accelerate RL post-training still suffer from low resource utilization and limited scalability. We present ROLL Flash, a system that extends ROLL with native support for asynchronous RL post-training. ROLL Flash is built upon two core design principles: fine-grained parallelism and rollout-train decoupling. Guided by these principles, ROLL Flash provides flexible programming interfaces that enable a fully asynchronous training architecture and support efficient rollout mechanisms, including queue scheduling and environment-level asynchronous execution. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ROLL Flash significantly improves resource utilization and scalability over synchronous RL post-training. ROLL Flash achieves up to 2.24x speedup on RLVR tasks and 2.72x on agentic tasks, using the same GPU budget as synchronous baselines. Furthermore, we implement several popular off-policy algorithms and verify that asynchronous training can achieve performance on par with synchronous training.

<title>Uncertainty-Aware ControlNet: Bridging Domain Gaps with Synthetic Image Generation</title>

Abstract: Generative Models are a valuable tool for the controlled creation of high-quality image data. Controlled diffusion models like the ControlNet have allowed the creation of labeled distributions. Such synthetic datasets can augment the original training distribution when discriminative models, like semantic segmentation, are trained. However, this augmentation effect is limited since ControlNets tend to reproduce the original training distribution.
  This work introduces a method to utilize data from unlabeled domains to train ControlNets by introducing the concept of uncertainty into the control mechanism. The uncertainty indicates that a given image was not part of the training distribution of a downstream task, e.g., segmentation. Thus, two types of control are engaged in the final network: an uncertainty control from an unlabeled dataset and a semantic control from the labeled dataset. The resulting ControlNet allows us to create annotated data with high uncertainty from the target domain, i.e., synthetic data from the unlabeled distribution with labels. In our scenario, we consider retinal OCTs, where typically high-quality Spectralis images are available with given ground truth segmentations, enabling the training of segmentation networks. The recent development in Home-OCT devices, however, yields retinal OCTs with lower quality and a large domain shift, such that out-of-the-pocket segmentation networks cannot be applied for this type of data. Synthesizing annotated images from the Home-OCT domain using the proposed approach closes this gap and leads to significantly improved segmentation results without adding any further supervision. The advantage of uncertainty-guidance becomes obvious when compared to style transfer: it enables arbitrary domain shifts without any strict learning of an image style. This is also demonstrated in a traffic scene experiment.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in node classification tasks over relational data, yet their effectiveness often depends on the availability of complete node features. In many real-world scenarios, however, feature matrices are highly sparse or contain sensitive information, leading to degraded performance and increased privacy risks. Furthermore, direct exposure of information can result in unintended data leakage, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive information. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multi-view Feature Propagation (MFP) framework that enhances node classification under feature sparsity while promoting privacy preservation. MFP extends traditional Feature Propagation (FP) by dividing the available features into multiple Gaussian-noised views, each propagating information independently through the graph topology. The aggregated representations yield expressive and robust node embeddings. This framework is novel in two respects: it introduces a mechanism that improves robustness under extreme sparsity, and it provides a principled way to balance utility with privacy. Extensive experiments conducted on graph datasets demonstrate that MFP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in node classification while substantially reducing privacy leakage. Moreover, our analysis demonstrates that propagated outputs serve as alternative imputations rather than reconstructions of the original features, preserving utility without compromising privacy. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis further confirms the stability and practical applicability of MFP across diverse scenarios. Overall, MFP provides an effective and privacy-aware framework for graph learning in domains characterized by missing or sensitive features.

Abstract: Adam is a popular and widely used adaptive gradient method in deep learning, which has also received tremendous focus in theoretical research. However, most existing theoretical work primarily analyzes its full-batch version, which differs fundamentally from the stochastic variant used in practice. Unlike SGD, stochastic Adam does not converge to its full-batch counterpart even with infinitesimal learning rates. We present the first theoretical characterization of how batch size affects Adam's generalization, analyzing two-layer over-parameterized CNNs on image data. Our results reveal that while both Adam and AdamW with proper weight decay $\lambda$ converge to poor test error solutions, their mini-batch variants can achieve near-zero test error. We further prove Adam has a strictly smaller effective weight decay bound than AdamW, theoretically explaining why Adam requires more sensitive $\lambda$ tuning. Extensive experiments validate our findings, demonstrating the critical role of batch size and weight decay in Adam's generalization performance.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge. While traditional retrieval focuses on relevance, RAG's effectiveness depends on the utility of retrieved passages, i.e., the usefulness in facilitating the generation of an accurate and comprehensive answer. Existing studies often treat utility as a generic attribute, ignoring the fact that different LLMs may benefit differently from the same passage due to variations in internal knowledge and comprehension ability. In this work, we introduce and systematically investigate the notion of LLM-specific utility. Through large-scale experiments across multiple datasets and LLMs, we demonstrate that human-annotated passages are not optimal for LLMs and that ground-truth utilitarian passages are not transferable across different LLMs. These findings highlight the necessity of adopting the LLM-specific utility in RAG research. Our findings indicate that some human-annotated passages are not ground-truth utilitarian passages for specific LLMs, partially due to the varying readability of queries and passages for LLMs, a tendency for which perplexity is a key metric. Based on these findings, we propose a benchmarking procedure for LLM-specific utility judgments. We evaluate existing utility judgment methods on six datasets and find that while verbalized methods using pseudo-answers perform robustly, LLMs struggle to assess utility effectively-failing to reject all passages for known queries and to select truly useful ones for unknown queries.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a crucial approach for enhancing the capabilities of large language models. However, in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, the routing mechanism often introduces instability, even leading to catastrophic RL training collapse. We analyze the training-inference consistency of MoE models and identify a notable discrepancy in routing behaviors between the two phases. Moreover, even under identical conditions, the routing framework can yield divergent expert selections across repeated forward passes. To address this foundational inconsistency, we propose Rollout Routing Replay (R3), a method that records routing distributions from the inference engine and replays them during training. R3 significantly reduces training-inference policy KL divergence and mitigates extreme discrepancies without compromising training speed. Extensive experiments on various settings confirm that R3 succeeds in stabilizing RL training, preventing collapse and outperforming methods such as GSPO and TIS. We believe this work can offer a new solution for stabilizing RL in MoE models.

Abstract: Although large language models excel across many tasks, they can memorise training data and thereby expose private or copyrighted text. Most defences target the pre-training stage, leaving memorisation during fine-tuning, especially for domain adaptation and instruction tuning, poorly understood. We fine-tune Pythia, Llama3, and Mistral models spanning 1.4B-70B parameters on common evaluation datasets and track verbatim memorisation throughout training. We find that memorisation increases dramatically in the first few epochs, often significantly before either validation perplexity or evaluation performance is optimised. We use a simple but effective n-gram memorisation score which reliably precedes verbatim memorisation; using it as an early-stopping criterion mitigates memorisation with minimal performance loss. Further, we introduce an n-gram-aware loss regulariser and show that it reduces memorisation across all model families tested by up to 40% while minimising evaluation performance trade-offs when compared to an existing memorisation mitigation strategy. These results yield practical, scalable insights into memorisation dynamics during language model fine-tuning.

Abstract: We present a systematic study of medical-domain interpretability in Large Language Models (LLMs). We study how the LLMs both represent and process medical knowledge through four different interpretability techniques: (1) UMAP projections of intermediate activations, (2) gradient-based saliency with respect to the model weights, (3) layer lesioning/removal and (4) activation patching. We present knowledge maps of five LLMs which show, at a coarse-resolution, where knowledge about patient's ages, medical symptoms, diseases and drugs is stored in the models. In particular for Llama3.3-70B, we find that most medical knowledge is processed in the first half of the model's layers. In addition, we find several interesting phenomena: (i) age is often encoded in a non-linear and sometimes discontinuous manner at intermediate layers in the models, (ii) the disease progression representation is non-monotonic and circular at certain layers of the model, (iii) in Llama3.3-70B, drugs cluster better by medical specialty rather than mechanism of action, especially for Llama3.3-70B and (iv) Gemma3-27B and MedGemma-27B have activations that collapse at intermediate layers but recover by the final layers. These results can guide future research on fine-tuning, un-learning or de-biasing LLMs for medical tasks by suggesting at which layers in the model these techniques should be applied.

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic workflows have enabled the automation of tasks such as professional document generation. However, they primarily focus on textual quality, neglecting visual structure and style, which are crucial for readability and engagement. This gap arises mainly from the absence of suitable reward models to guide agentic workflows toward producing documents with stronger structural and stylistic quality. To address this, we propose DocReward, a document reward model that evaluates documents based on their structure and style. We construct a multi-domain dataset DocPair of 117K paired documents, covering 32 domains and 267 document types, each including a high- and low-professionalism document with identical content but different structure and style. This enables the model to evaluate professionalism comprehensively, and in a textual-quality-agnostic way. DocReward is trained using the Bradley-Terry loss to score documents, penalizing predictions that contradict the annotated ranking. To assess the performance of reward models, we create a test dataset containing document bundles ranked by well-educated human evaluators. Notably, DocReward outperforms GPT-4o and GPT-5 in accuracy by 30.6 and 19.4 percentage points, respectively, demonstrating its superiority over baselines. In an extrinsic evaluation of document generation, DocReward achieves a significantly higher win rate of 60.8%, compared to GPT-5's 37.7% win rate, demonstrating its utility in guiding generation agents toward producing human-preferred documents.

Abstract: Truly reliable AI requires more than simply scaling up knowledge; it demands the ability to know what it knows and when it does not. Yet recent research shows that even the best LLMs misjudge their own competence in more than one in five cases, making any response born of such internal uncertainty impossible to fully trust. Inspired by self-improvement reinforcement learning techniques that require minimal data, we present a simple but powerful framework KnowRL that strengthens a model's internal understanding of its own feasibility boundaries, enabling safer and more responsible behaviour. Our framework combines two components: (i) introspection, where the model generates and classifies tasks it judges feasible or infeasible, and (ii) consensus-based rewarding, where stability of self-knowledge assessment is reinforced through internal agreement. By using internally generated data, this design strengthens consistency in self-knowledge and entirely avoids costly external supervision. In experiments on LLaMA-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B, KnowRL steadily improved self-knowledge, validated by both intrinsic self-consistency and extrinsic benchmarking. With nothing more than a small seed set and no external supervision, our method drove gains as high as 28% in accuracy and 12% in F1, outperforming baselines in just a few iterations. Our framework essentially unlocks the untapped capacity of LLMs to self-improve their knowledge awareness, opening the door to reliable, more accountable AI and safer deployment in critical applications. Owing to its simplicity and independence from external effort, we encourage applying this reliability-enhancing process to all future models.

<title>Reconstructing 12-Lead ECG from 3-Lead ECG using Variational Autoencoder to Improve Cardiac Disease Detection of Wearable ECG Devices</title>

Abstract: Twelve-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) are the clinical gold standard for cardiac diagnosis, providing comprehensive spatial coverage of the heart necessary to detect conditions such as myocardial infarction (MI). However, their lack of portability limits continuous and large-scale use. Three-lead ECG systems are widely used in wearable devices due to their simplicity and mobility, but they often fail to capture pathologies in unmeasured regions. To address this, we propose WearECG, a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) method that reconstructs twelve-lead ECGs from three leads: II, V1, and V5. Our model includes architectural improvements to better capture temporal and spatial dependencies in ECG signals. We evaluate generation quality using MSE, MAE, and Frechet Inception Distance (FID), and assess clinical validity via a Turing test with expert cardiologists. To further validate diagnostic utility, we fine-tune ECGFounder, a large-scale pretrained ECG model, on a multi-label classification task involving over 40 cardiac conditions, including six different myocardial infarction locations, using both real and generated signals. Experiments on the MIMIC dataset show that our method produces physiologically realistic and diagnostically informative signals, with robust performance in downstream tasks. This work demonstrates the potential of generative modeling for ECG reconstruction and its implications for scalable, low-cost cardiac screening.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown strong capabilities in audio understanding. However, most systems rely solely on end-to-end reasoning, limiting interpretability and accuracy for tasks that require structured knowledge or specialized signal analysis. In this work, we present Audio-Maestro -- a tool-augmented audio reasoning framework that enables audio-language models to autonomously call external tools and integrate their timestamped outputs into the reasoning process. This design allows the model to analyze, transform, and interpret audio signals through specialized tools rather than relying solely on end-to-end inference. Experiments show that Audio-Maestro consistently improves general audio reasoning performance: Gemini-2.5-flash's average accuracy on MMAU-Test rises from 67.4% to 72.1%, DeSTA-2.5 from 58.3% to 62.8%, and GPT-4o from 60.8% to 63.9%. To our knowledge, Audio-Maestro is the first framework to integrate structured tool output into the large audio language model reasoning process.

<title>Iterative Amortized Inference: Unifying In-Context Learning and Learned Optimizers</title>

Abstract: Modern learning systems increasingly rely on amortized learning - the idea of reusing computation or inductive biases shared across tasks to enable rapid generalization to novel problems. This principle spans a range of approaches, including meta-learning, in-context learning, prompt tuning, learned optimizers and more. While motivated by similar goals, these approaches differ in how they encode and leverage task-specific information, often provided as in-context examples. In this work, we propose a unified framework which describes how such methods differ primarily in the aspects of learning they amortize - such as initializations, learned updates, or predictive mappings - and how they incorporate task data at inference. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes amortized models into parametric, implicit, and explicit regimes, based on whether task adaptation is externalized, internalized, or jointly modeled. Building on this view, we identify a key limitation in current approaches: most methods struggle to scale to large datasets because their capacity to process task data at inference (e.g., context length) is often limited. To address this, we propose iterative amortized inference, a class of models that refine solutions step-by-step over mini-batches, drawing inspiration from stochastic optimization. Our formulation bridges optimization-based meta-learning with forward-pass amortization in models like LLMs, offering a scalable and extensible foundation for general-purpose task adaptation.

Abstract: Achieving mission objectives in a realistic simulation of aerial combat is highly challenging due to imperfect situational awareness and nonlinear flight dynamics. In this work, we introduce a novel 3D multi-agent air combat environment and a Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning framework to tackle these challenges. Our approach combines heterogeneous agent dynamics, curriculum learning, league-play, and a newly adapted training algorithm. To this end, the decision-making process is organized into two abstraction levels: low-level policies learn precise control maneuvers, while high-level policies issue tactical commands based on mission objectives. Empirical results show that our hierarchical approach improves both learning efficiency and combat performance in complex dogfight scenarios.

Abstract: Text preprocessing is a fundamental component of Natural Language Processing, involving techniques such as stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization to prepare text as input for further processing and analysis. Despite the context-dependent nature of the above techniques, traditional methods usually ignore contextual information. In this paper, we investigate the idea of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform various preprocessing tasks, due to their ability to take context into account without requiring extensive language-specific annotated resources. Through a comprehensive evaluation on web-sourced data, we compare LLM-based preprocessing (specifically stopword removal, lemmatization and stemming) to traditional algorithms across multiple text classification tasks in six European languages. Our analysis indicates that LLMs are capable of replicating traditional stopword removal, lemmatization, and stemming methods with accuracies reaching 97%, 82%, and 74%, respectively. Additionally, we show that ML algorithms trained on texts preprocessed by LLMs achieve an improvement of up to 6% with respect to the $F_1$ measure compared to traditional techniques. Our code, prompts, and results are publicly available at https://github.com/GianCarloMilanese/llm_pipeline_wi-iat.

Abstract: In recent years, while cloud-based MLLMs such as QwenVL, InternVL, GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude Sonnet have demonstrated outstanding performance with enormous model sizes reaching hundreds of billions of parameters, they significantly surpass the limitations in memory, power consumption, and computing capacity of edge devices such as mobile phones. This paper introduces AndesVL, a suite of mobile-side MLLMs with 0.6B to 4B parameters based on Qwen3's LLM and various visual encoders. We comprehensively outline the model architectures, training pipeline, and training data of AndesVL, which achieves first-tier performance across a wide range of open-source benchmarks, including fields such as text-rich image understanding, reasoning and math, multi-image comprehension, general VQA, hallucination mitigation, multilingual understanding, and GUI-related tasks when compared with state-of-the-art models of a similar scale.

Abstract: Generative models have emerged as a powerful class of policies for offline reinforcement learning (RL) due to their ability to capture complex, multi-modal behaviors. However, existing methods face a stark trade-off: slow, iterative models like diffusion policies are computationally expensive, while fast, single-step models like consistency policies often suffer from degraded performance. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to bridge this gap. The key to moving beyond the limitations of individual methods, we argue, lies in a unifying perspective that views modern generative models, including diffusion, flow matching, and consistency models, as specific instances of learning a continuous-time generative trajectory governed by an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE). This principled foundation provides a clearer design space for generative policies in RL and allows us to propose Generative Trajectory Policies (GTPs), a new and more general policy paradigm that learns the entire solution map of the underlying ODE. To make this paradigm practical for offline RL, we further introduce two key theoretically principled adaptations. Empirical results demonstrate that GTP achieves state-of-the-art performance on D4RL benchmarks - it significantly outperforms prior generative policies, achieving perfect scores on several notoriously hard AntMaze tasks.

Abstract: Games have long been a microcosm for studying planning and reasoning in both natural and artificial intelligence, especially with a focus on expert-level or even super-human play. But real life also pushes human intelligence along a different frontier, requiring people to flexibly navigate decision-making problems that they have never thought about before. Here, we use novice gameplay to study how people make decisions and form judgments in new problem settings. We show that people are systematic and adaptively rational in how they play a game for the first time, or evaluate a game (e.g., how fair or how fun it is likely to be) before they have played it even once. We explain these capacities via a computational cognitive model that we call the "Intuitive Gamer". The model is based on mechanisms of fast and flat (depth-limited) goal-directed probabilistic simulation--analogous to those used in Monte Carlo tree-search models of expert game-play, but scaled down to use very few stochastic samples, simple goal heuristics for evaluating actions, and no deep search. In a series of large-scale behavioral studies with over 1000 participants and 121 two-player strategic board games (almost all novel to our participants), our model quantitatively captures human judgments and decisions varying the amount and kind of experience people have with a game--from no experience at all ("just thinking"), to a single round of play, to indirect experience watching another person and predicting how they should play--and does so significantly better than much more compute-intensive expert-level models. More broadly, our work offers new insights into how people rapidly evaluate, act, and make suggestions when encountering novel problems, and could inform the design of more flexible and human-like AI systems that can determine not just how to solve new tasks, but whether a task is worth thinking about at all.

Abstract: Sampling, the technique of reusing pieces of existing audio tracks to create new music content, is a very common practice in modern music production. In this paper, we tackle the challenging task of automatic sample identification, that is, detecting such sampled content and retrieving the material from which it originates. To do so, we adopt a self-supervised learning approach that leverages a multi-track dataset to create positive pairs of artificial mixes, and design a novel contrastive learning objective. We show that such method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines, that is robust to various genres, and that scales well when increasing the number of noise songs in the reference database. In addition, we extensively analyze the contribution of the different components of our training pipeline and highlight, in particular, the need for high-quality separated stems for this task.

Abstract: Intuitive physics understanding in video diffusion models plays an essential role in building general-purpose physically plausible world simulators, yet accurately evaluating such capacity remains a challenging task due to the difficulty in disentangling physics correctness from visual appearance in generation. To the end, we introduce LikePhys, a training-free method that evaluates intuitive physics in video diffusion models by distinguishing physically valid and impossible videos using the denoising objective as an ELBO-based likelihood surrogate on a curated dataset of valid-invalid pairs. By testing on our constructed benchmark of twelve scenarios spanning over four physics domains, we show that our evaluation metric, Plausibility Preference Error (PPE), demonstrates strong alignment with human preference, outperforming state-of-the-art evaluator baselines. We then systematically benchmark intuitive physics understanding in current video diffusion models. Our study further analyses how model design and inference settings affect intuitive physics understanding and highlights domain-specific capacity variations across physical laws. Empirical results show that, despite current models struggling with complex and chaotic dynamics, there is a clear trend of improvement in physics understanding as model capacity and inference settings scale.

Abstract: The use of AI code-generation tools is becoming increasingly common, making it important to understand how software developers are adopting these tools. In this study, we investigate how developers engage with Amazon's CodeWhisperer, an LLM-based code-generation tool. We conducted two user studies with two groups of 10 participants each, interacting with CodeWhisperer - the first to understand which interactions were critical to capture and the second to collect low-level interaction data using a custom telemetry plugin. Our mixed-methods analysis identified four behavioral patterns: 1) incremental code refinement, 2) explicit instruction using natural language comments, 3) baseline structuring with model suggestions, and 4) integrative use with external sources. We provide a comprehensive analysis of these patterns .

Abstract: Timely delivery of delay-sensitive information over dynamic, heterogeneous networks is increasingly essential for a range of interactive applications, such as industrial automation, self-driving vehicles, and augmented reality. However, most existing network control solutions target only average delay performance, falling short of providing strict End-to-End (E2E) peak latency guarantees. This paper addresses the challenge of reliably delivering packets within application-imposed deadlines by leveraging recent advancements in Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MA-DRL). After introducing the Delay-Constrained Maximum-Throughput (DCMT) dynamic network control problem, and highlighting the limitations of current solutions, we present a novel MA-DRL network control framework that leverages a centralized routing and distributed scheduling architecture. The proposed framework leverages critical networking domain knowledge for the design of effective MA-DRL strategies based on the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) technique, where centralized routing and distributed scheduling agents dynamically assign paths and schedule packet transmissions according to packet lifetimes, thereby maximizing on-time packet delivery. The generality of the proposed framework allows integrating both data-driven \blue{Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)} agents and traditional rule-based policies in order to strike the right balance between performance and learning complexity. Our results confirm the superiority of the proposed framework with respect to traditional stochastic optimization-based approaches and provide key insights into the role and interplay between data-driven DRL agents and new rule-based policies for both efficient and high-performance control of latency-critical services.

Abstract: Understanding how developers interact with code generation tools (CGTs) requires detailed, real-time data on programming behavior which is often difficult to collect without disrupting workflow. We present \textit{CodeWatcher}, a lightweight, unobtrusive client-server system designed to capture fine-grained interaction events from within the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) editor. \textit{CodeWatcher} logs semantically meaningful events such as insertions made by CGTs, deletions, copy-paste actions, and focus shifts, enabling continuous monitoring of developer activity without modifying user workflows. The system comprises a VS Code plugin, a Python-based RESTful API, and a MongoDB backend, all containerized for scalability and ease of deployment. By structuring and timestamping each event, \textit{CodeWatcher} enables post-hoc reconstruction of coding sessions and facilitates rich behavioral analyses, including how and when CGTs are used during development. This infrastructure is crucial for supporting research on responsible AI, developer productivity, and the human-centered evaluation of CGTs.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated its ability to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources. However, multi-hop questions, which require the identification of multiple knowledge targets to form a synthesized answer, raise new challenges for RAG systems. Under the multi-hop settings, existing methods often struggle to fully understand the questions with complex semantic structures and are susceptible to irrelevant noise during the retrieval of multiple information targets. To address these limitations, we propose a novel graph representation learning framework for multi-hop question retrieval. We first introduce a Multi-information Level Knowledge Graph (Multi-L KG) to model various information levels for a more comprehensive understanding of multi-hop questions. Based on this, we design a Query-Specific Graph Neural Network (QSGNN) for representation learning on the Multi-L KG. QSGNN employs intra/inter-level message passing mechanisms, and in each message passing the information aggregation is guided by the query, which not only facilitates multi-granular information aggregation but also significantly reduces the impact of noise. To enhance its ability to learn robust representations, we further propose two synthesized data generation strategies for pre-training the QSGNN. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in multi-hop scenarios, especially in high-hop questions the improvement can reach 33.8\%. The code is available at: https://github.com/Jerry2398/QSGNN.

Abstract: The advent of LLMs has given rise to a new type of web search: Generative search, where LLMs retrieve web pages related to a query and generate a single, coherent text as a response. This output modality stands in stark contrast to traditional web search, where results are returned as a ranked list of independent web pages. In this paper, we ask: Along what dimensions do generative search outputs differ from traditional web search? We compare Google, a traditional web search engine, with four generative search engines from two providers (Google and OpenAI) across queries from four domains. Our analysis reveals intriguing differences. Most generative search engines cover a wider range of sources compared to web search. Generative search engines vary in the degree to which they rely on internal knowledge contained within the model parameters v.s. external knowledge retrieved from the web. Generative search engines surface varying sets of concepts, creating new opportunities for enhancing search diversity and serendipity. Our results also highlight the need for revisiting evaluation criteria for web search in the age of Generative AI.

Abstract: For reliable large-scale quantum computation, a quantum error correction (QEC) scheme must effectively resolve physical errors to protect logical information. Leveraging recent advances in deep learning, neural network-based decoders have emerged as a promising approach to enhance the reliability of QEC. We propose the Hierarchical Qubit-Merging Transformer (HQMT), a novel and general decoding framework that explicitly leverages the structural graph of stabilizer codes to learn error correlations across multiple scales. Our architecture first computes attention locally on structurally related groups of stabilizers and then systematically merges these qubit-centric representations to build a global view of the error syndrome. The proposed HQMT achieves substantially lower logical error rates for surface codes by integrating a dedicated qubit-merging layer within the transformer architecture. Across various code distances, HQMT significantly outperforms previous neural network-based QEC decoders as well as a powerful belief propagation with ordered statistics decoding (BP+OSD) baseline. This hierarchical approach provides a scalable and effective framework for surface code decoding, advancing the realization of reliable quantum computing.

Abstract: We propose SemCSE-Multi, a novel unsupervised framework for generating multifaceted embeddings of scientific abstracts, evaluated in the domains of invasion biology and medicine. These embeddings capture distinct, individually specifiable aspects in isolation, thus enabling fine-grained and controllable similarity assessments as well as adaptive, user-driven visualizations of scientific domains. Our approach relies on an unsupervised procedure that produces aspect-specific summarizing sentences and trains embedding models to map semantically related summaries to nearby positions in the embedding space. We then distill these aspect-specific embedding capabilities into a unified embedding model that directly predicts multiple aspect embeddings from a scientific abstract in a single, efficient forward pass. In addition, we introduce an embedding decoding pipeline that decodes embeddings back into natural language descriptions of their associated aspects. Notably, we show that this decoding remains effective even for unoccupied regions in low-dimensional visualizations, thus offering vastly improved interpretability in user-centric settings.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a key technique for compressing large-scale language models (LLMs), yet prevailing logit-based methods typically employ static strategies that are misaligned with the dynamic learning process of student models. These methods typically treat all tokens indiscriminately and apply a single, fixed temperature, resulting in suboptimal knowledge transfer. To address these limitations, we propose LLM-Oriented Token-Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (AdaKD), a novel framework that adapts the distillation process to the real-time learning state of each token. AdaKD consists of two synergistic modules driven by a unified token difficulty metric. First, our Loss-Driven Adaptive Token Focusing (LATF) module dynamically adjusts the distillation focus by monitoring the student's learning stability, concentrating computational resources on the most valuable tokens at each training phase. Second, we introduce Inverse Difficulty Temperature Scaling (IDTS), a counterintuitive yet effective token-level temperature strategy. It employs low temperatures for difficult tokens for targeted error correction, and high temperatures for easy tokens to encourage students to learn from the teacher's complete and smooth output distribution, thereby enhancing generalization. As a plug-and-play framework, AdaKD can consistently improve the performance of various distillation methods on multiple model architectures and benchmarks.

Abstract: Statistical arbitrage exploits temporal price differences between similar assets. We develop a framework to jointly identify similar assets through factors, identify mispricing and form a trading policy that maximizes risk-adjusted performance after trading costs. Our Attention Factors are conditional latent factors that are the most useful for arbitrage trading. They are learned from firm characteristic embeddings that allow for complex interactions. We identify time-series signals from the residual portfolios of our factors with a general sequence model. Estimating factors and the arbitrage trading strategy jointly is crucial to maximize profitability after trading costs. In a comprehensive empirical study we show that our Attention Factor model achieves an out-of-sample Sharpe ratio above 4 on the largest U.S. equities over a 24-year period. Our one-step solution yields an unprecedented Sharpe ratio of 2.3 net of transaction costs. We show that weak factors are important for arbitrage trading.

Abstract: Combining large language models with evolutionary computation algorithms represents a promising research direction leveraging the remarkable generative and in-context learning capabilities of LLMs with the strengths of evolutionary algorithms. In this work, we present EvoCAD, a method for generating computer-aided design (CAD) objects through their symbolic representations using vision language models and evolutionary optimization. Our method samples multiple CAD objects, which are then optimized using an evolutionary approach with vision language and reasoning language models. We assess our method using GPT-4V and GPT-4o, evaluating it on the CADPrompt benchmark dataset and comparing it to prior methods. Additionally, we introduce two new metrics based on topological properties defined by the Euler characteristic, which capture a form of semantic similarity between 3D objects. Our results demonstrate that EvoCAD outperforms previous approaches on multiple metrics, particularly in generating topologically correct objects, which can be efficiently evaluated using our two novel metrics that complement existing spatial metrics.

<title>NV3D: Leveraging Spatial Shape Through Normal Vector-based 3D Object Detection</title>

Abstract: Recent studies in 3D object detection for autonomous vehicles aim to enrich features through the utilization of multi-modal setups or the extraction of local patterns within LiDAR point clouds. However, multi-modal methods face significant challenges in feature alignment, and gaining features locally can be oversimplified for complex 3D object detection tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel model, NV3D, which utilizes local features acquired from voxel neighbors, as normal vectors computed per voxel basis using K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and principal component analysis (PCA). This informative feature enables NV3D to determine the relationship between the surface and pertinent target entities, including cars, pedestrians, or cyclists. During the normal vector extraction process, NV3D offers two distinct sampling strategies: normal vector density-based sampling and FOV-aware bin-based sampling, allowing elimination of up to 55% of data while maintaining performance. In addition, we applied element-wise attention fusion, which accepts voxel features as the query and value and normal vector features as the key, similar to the attention mechanism. Our method is trained on the KITTI dataset and has demonstrated superior performance in car and cyclist detection owing to their spatial shapes. In the validation set, NV3D without sampling achieves 86.60% and 80.18% mean Average Precision (mAP), greater than the baseline Voxel R-CNN by 2.61% and 4.23% mAP, respectively. With both samplings, NV3D achieves 85.54% mAP in car detection, exceeding the baseline by 1.56% mAP, despite roughly 55% of voxels being filtered out.

Abstract: With the advent of DeepSeek-R1, a new wave of reinforcement learning (RL) methods has emerged that seem to unlock stronger mathematical reasoning. However, a closer look at the open-source ecosystem reveals a critical limitation: with sufficiently many draws (e.g., $\texttt{pass@1024}$), many existing base models already solve nearly all questions on widely used math benchmarks such as MATH-500 and AIME 2024. This suggests that the RL fine-tuning methods prevalent in the LLM reasoning literature largely sharpen existing solution modes rather than discovering entirely new ones. Such sharpening stands in contrast to the broader promise of RL: to foster exploration and to acquire new skills. To move beyond this plateau, we introduce MATH-Beyond (MATH-B), a benchmark deliberately constructed to defeat common open-source models of up to 8B parameters even under large sampling budgets. Improving performance on our benchmark via RL requires methods that learn to reason in ways that go beyond base model capabilities in repeated sampling. Since the problems are drawn from subsets of DAPO-Math-17K and DeepScaleR datasets, they remain topically equivalent to standard high-school math. Validating our premise, RL fine-tuned models such as Nemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B and DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview perform poorly on MATH-B at $\texttt{pass@1024}$, showing how existing approaches fall short on tackling harder instances. We hope MATH-B will catalyze exploration-driven RL approaches that elicit deeper reasoning capabilities. We release MATH-B at https://huggingface.co/datasets/brendel-group/MATH-Beyond.

Abstract: Financial markets face growing threats from misinformation that can trigger billions in losses in minutes. Most existing approaches lack transparency in their decision-making and provide limited attribution to credible sources. We introduce FinVet, a novel multi-agent framework that integrates two Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines with external fact-checking through a confidence-weighted voting mechanism. FinVet employs adaptive three-tier processing that dynamically adjusts verification strategies based on retrieval confidence, from direct metadata extraction to hybrid reasoning to full model-based analysis. Unlike existing methods, FinVet provides evidence-backed verdicts, source attribution, confidence scores, and explicit uncertainty flags when evidence is insufficient. Experimental evaluation on the FinFact dataset shows that FinVet achieves an F1 score of 0.85, which is a 10.4% improvement over the best individual pipeline (fact-check pipeline) and 37% improvement over standalone RAG approaches.

Abstract: While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in robotic manipulation, their performance in complex reasoning and long-horizon task planning is limited by data scarcity and model capacity. To address this, we introduce ManiAgent, an agentic architecture for general manipulation tasks that achieves end-to-end output from task descriptions and environmental inputs to robotic manipulation actions. In this framework, multiple agents involve inter-agent communication to perform environmental perception, sub-task decomposition and action generation, enabling efficient handling of complex manipulation scenarios. Evaluations show ManiAgent achieves an 86.8% success rate on the SimplerEnv benchmark and 95.8% on real-world pick-and-place tasks, enabling efficient data collection that yields VLA models with performance comparable to those trained on human-annotated datasets.The project webpage is available at https://yi-yang929.github.io/ManiAgent/.

Abstract: Interpreting deep neural networks through concept-based explanations offers a bridge between low-level features and high-level human-understandable semantics. However, existing automatic concept discovery methods often fail to align these extracted concepts with the model's true decision-making process, thereby compromising explanation faithfulness. In this work, we propose FACE (Faithful Automatic Concept Extraction), a novel framework that augments Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence regularization term to ensure alignment between the model's original and concept-based predictions. Unlike prior methods that operate solely on encoder activations, FACE incorporates classifier supervision during concept learning, enforcing predictive consistency and enabling faithful explanations. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that minimizing the KL divergence bounds the deviation in predictive distributions, thereby promoting faithful local linearity in the learned concept space. Systematic evaluations on ImageNet, COCO, and CelebA datasets demonstrate that FACE outperforms existing methods across faithfulness and sparsity metrics.

Abstract: We study convex composite optimization problems, where the objective function is given by the sum of a prox-friendly function and a convex function whose subgradients are estimated under heavy-tailed noise. Existing work often employs gradient clipping or normalization techniques in stochastic first-order methods to address heavy-tailed noise. In this paper, we demonstrate that a vanilla stochastic algorithm -- without additional modifications such as clipping or normalization -- can achieve optimal complexity for these problems. In particular, we establish that an accelerated stochastic proximal subgradient method achieves a first-order oracle complexity that is universally optimal for smooth, weakly smooth, and nonsmooth convex optimization, as well as for stochastic convex optimization under heavy-tailed noise. Numerical experiments are further provided to validate our theoretical results.

Abstract: Enabling humanoid robots to exploit physical contact, rather than simply avoid collisions, is crucial for autonomy in unstructured environments. Traditional optimization-based planners struggle with contact complexity, while on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) is sample-inefficient and has limited multi-task ability. We propose a framework combining a learned world model with sampling-based Model Predictive Control (MPC), trained on a demonstration-free offline dataset to predict future outcomes in a compressed latent space. To address sparse contact rewards and sensor noise, the MPC uses a learned surrogate value function for dense, robust planning. Our single, scalable model supports contact-aware tasks, including wall support after perturbation, blocking incoming objects, and traversing height-limited arches, with improved data efficiency and multi-task capability over on-policy RL. Deployed on a physical humanoid, our system achieves robust, real-time contact planning from proprioception and ego-centric depth images. Website: https://ego-vcp.github.io/

<title>Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization for Memory-efficient RL of Diffusion Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: A key challenge in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to diffusion large language models (dLLMs) lies in the intractability of their likelihood functions, which are essential for the RL objective, necessitating corresponding approximation in each training step. While existing methods approximate the log-likelihoods by their evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) via customized Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, the forward computational graphs of all MC samples need to be retained for the gradient computation of non-linear terms in the RL objective, resulting in significant memory overhead. This constraint restricts feasible sample sizes, leading to imprecise likelihood approximations and ultimately distorting the RL objective. To overcome this limitation, we propose \emph{Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization} (BGPO), a memory-efficient RL algorithm that maximizes a specially constructed lower bound of the ELBO-based objective. This lower bound is carefully designed to satisfy two key properties: (1) Linearity: it is formulated in a linear sum where each term depends only on a single MC sample, thereby enabling gradient accumulation across samples and ensuring constant memory usage; (2) Equivalence: Both the value and gradient of this lower bound are equal to those of the ELBO-based objective in on-policy training, making it also an effective approximation for the original RL objective. These properties allow BGPO to adopt a large MC sample size, resulting in more accurate likelihood approximations and improved RL objective estimation, which in turn leads to enhanced performance. Experiments show that BGPO significantly outperforms previous RL algorithms for dLLMs in math problem solving, code generation, and planning tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to expand the capabilities of language models, but it is unclear if current RL techniques promote the discovery of novel behaviors, or simply sharpen those already present in the base model. In this paper, we investigate the value of deliberate exploration -- explicitly incentivizing the model to discover novel and diverse behaviors -- and aim to understand how the knowledge in pre-trained models can guide this search. Our main finding is that exploration with a simple, principled, representation-based bonus derived from the pre-trained language model's hidden states significantly improves diversity and pass@k rates -- both for post-training, and in a novel inference-time scaling setting we introduce. For inference-time, exploration with representation-based diversity improves efficiency, consistently improving pass@k rates across a variety of models and reasoning tasks. For example, for Qwen-2.5-14b-Instruct we obtain over 50% improvement in verifier efficiency on almost all tasks. For post-training, we show that integrating this exploration strategy into an RL pipeline improves reasoning performance over that of the initial model and over standard RL post-training. For example, on AIME 2024, our post-trained Qwen-2.5-7b-Instruct's pass@80 matches the pass@256 of GRPO on the same model, demonstrating a 3x improvement in test-time sample efficiency. Overall, our findings suggest that deliberate exploration -- with the right notion of diversity -- is a practical path toward discovery of new behaviors beyond sharpening.

Abstract: The increasing autonomy of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates a rigorous evaluation of their potential to aid in cyber offense. Existing benchmarks often lack real-world complexity and are thus unable to accurately assess LLMs' cybersecurity capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce PACEbench, a practical AI cyber-exploitation benchmark built on the principles of realistic vulnerability difficulty, environmental complexity, and cyber defenses. Specifically, PACEbench comprises four scenarios spanning single, blended, chained, and defense vulnerability exploitations. To handle these complex challenges, we propose PACEagent, a novel agent that emulates human penetration testers by supporting multi-phase reconnaissance, analysis, and exploitation. Extensive experiments with seven frontier LLMs demonstrate that current models struggle with complex cyber scenarios, and none can bypass defenses. These findings suggest that current models do not yet pose a generalized cyber offense threat. Nonetheless, our work provides a robust benchmark to guide the trustworthy development of future models.

Abstract: Learning robotic manipulation policies directly in the real world can be expensive and time-consuming. While reinforcement learning (RL) policies trained in simulation present a scalable alternative, effective sim-to-real transfer remains challenging, particularly for tasks that require precise dynamics. To address this, we propose Phys2Real, a real-to-sim-to-real RL pipeline that combines vision-language model (VLM)-inferred physical parameter estimates with interactive adaptation through uncertainty-aware fusion. Our approach consists of three core components: (1) high-fidelity geometric reconstruction with 3D Gaussian splatting, (2) VLM-inferred prior distributions over physical parameters, and (3) online physical parameter estimation from interaction data. Phys2Real conditions policies on interpretable physical parameters, refining VLM predictions with online estimates via ensemble-based uncertainty quantification. On planar pushing tasks of a T-block with varying center of mass (CoM) and a hammer with an off-center mass distribution, Phys2Real achieves substantial improvements over a domain randomization baseline: 100% vs 79% success rate for the bottom-weighted T-block, 57% vs 23% in the challenging top-weighted T-block, and 15% faster average task completion for hammer pushing. Ablation studies indicate that the combination of VLM and interaction information is essential for success. Project website: https://phys2real.github.io/ .

Abstract: Recent multimodal embedding approaches leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) fine-tuned with contrastive learning (CL) have shown promising results, yet the underlying reasons behind their superiority remain underexplored. This work argues that a crucial advantage of MLLM-based approaches stems from implicit cross-modal alignment achieved during generative pretraining, where the language decoder learns to exploit multimodal signals within a shared representation space for generating unimodal outputs. Through analysis of anisotropy and kernel similarity structure, we empirically confirm that latent alignment emerges within MLLM representations, allowing CL to serve as a lightweight refinement stage. Leveraging this insight, we propose a Language-Centric Omnimodal Embedding framework, termed LCO-Emb. Extensive experiments across diverse backbones and benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance across modalities. Furthermore, we identify a Generation-Representation Scaling Law (GRSL), showing that the representational capabilities gained through contrastive refinement scales positively with the MLLM's generative capabilities. This suggests that improving generative abilities evolves as an effective paradigm for enhancing representation quality. We provide a theoretical explanation of GRSL, which formally links the MLLM's generative quality to the upper bound on its representation performance, and validate it on a challenging, low-resource visual-document retrieval task, showing that continual generative pretraining before CL can further enhance the potential of a model's embedding capabilities. Codes, models, and resources are available at https://github.com/LCO-Embedding/LCO-Embedding.

Abstract: Fundamental questions remain about when and why adversarial examples arise in neural networks, with competing views characterising them either as artifacts of the irregularities in the decision landscape or as products of sensitivity to non-robust input features. In this paper, we instead argue that adversarial vulnerability can stem from efficient information encoding in neural networks. Specifically, we show how superposition - where networks represent more features than they have dimensions - creates arrangements of latent representations that adversaries can exploit. We demonstrate that adversarial perturbations leverage interference between superposed features, making attack patterns predictable from feature arrangements. Our framework provides a mechanistic explanation for two known phenomena: adversarial attack transferability between models with similar training regimes and class-specific vulnerability patterns. In synthetic settings with precisely controlled superposition, we establish that superposition suffices to create adversarial vulnerability. We then demonstrate that these findings persist in a ViT trained on CIFAR-10. These findings reveal adversarial vulnerability can be a byproduct of networks' representational compression, rather than flaws in the learning process or non-robust inputs.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown significant progress in mathematical reasoning, yet they still face a critical bottleneck with problems requiring visual assistance, such as drawing auxiliary lines or plotting functions to solve the problems. Most LLMs and VLMs are constrained to text-only reasoning chains, while multimodal unified models that can generate interleaved text and images lack the necessary precision and controllability for such tasks. To address this, we propose CodePlot-CoT, a code-driven Chain-of-Thought paradigm for "thinking with images" in mathematics. Our approach leverages the VLM to generate text reasoning as well as executable plotting code, which is then rendered into images as "visual thought", to solve mathematical problems. To achieve this, we first construct Math-VR, the first large-scale, bilingual dataset and benchmark for Mathematics problems with Visual Reasoning, comprising 178K samples. Second, to create high-quality training data, we develop a state-of-the-art image-to-code converter specialized for parsing complex mathematical figures into codes. Finally, using these training data, we train the CodePlot-CoT model for solving mathematical problems. Experimental results show that our model achieves up to 21% increase over base model on our new benchmark, fully validating the efficacy of our proposed code-driven reasoning paradigm. Our work opens a new direction for multimodal mathematical reasoning and provides the community with the first large-scale dataset, comprehensive benchmark, and strong approach for such problems. To facilitate future research, we make our datasets, code, and pretrained models publicly available at https://github.com/HKU-MMLab/Math-VR-CodePlot-CoT.

Abstract: We propose multi-agent reinforcement learning as a new method for modeling fake news in social networks. This method allows us to model human behavior in social networks both in unaccustomed populations and in populations that have adapted to the presence of fake news. In particular the latter is challenging for existing methods. We find that a fake-news attack is more effective if it targets highly connected people and people with weaker private information. Attacks are more effective when the disinformation is spread across several agents than when the disinformation is concentrated with more intensity on fewer agents. Furthermore, fake news spread less well in balanced networks than in clustered networks. We test a part of our findings in a human-subject experiment. The experimental evidence provides support for the predictions from the model, suggesting that the model is suitable to analyze the spread of fake news in social networks.

Abstract: A key challenge in the field of reinforcement learning is to develop agents that behave cautiously in novel situations. It is generally impossible to anticipate all situations that an autonomous system may face or what behavior would best avoid bad outcomes. An agent that can learn to be cautious would overcome this challenge by discovering for itself when and how to behave cautiously. In contrast, current approaches typically embed task-specific safety information or explicit cautious behaviors into the system, which is error-prone and imposes extra burdens on practitioners. In this paper, we present both a sequence of tasks where cautious behavior becomes increasingly non-obvious, as well as an algorithm to demonstrate that it is possible for a system to learn to be cautious. The essential features of our algorithm are that it characterizes reward function uncertainty without task-specific safety information and uses this uncertainty to construct a robust policy. Specifically, we construct robust policies with a k-of-N counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) subroutine given learned reward function uncertainty represented by a neural network ensemble. These policies exhibit caution in each of our tasks without any task-specific safety tuning. Our code is available at https://github.com/montaserFath/Learning-to-be-Cautious

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT exhibited unprecedented machine intelligence, it also shows great performance in assisting hardware engineers to realize higher-efficiency logic design via natural language interaction. To estimate the potential of the hardware design process assisted by LLMs, this work attempts to demonstrate an automated design environment that explores LLMs to generate hardware logic designs from natural language specifications. To realize a more accessible and efficient chip development flow, we present a scalable four-stage zero-code logic design framework based on LLMs without retraining or finetuning. At first, the demo, ChipGPT, begins by generating prompts for the LLM, which then produces initial Verilog programs. Second, an output manager corrects and optimizes these programs before collecting them into the final design space. Eventually, ChipGPT will search through this space to select the optimal design under the target metrics. The evaluation sheds some light on whether LLMs can generate correct and complete hardware logic designs described by natural language for some specifications. It is shown that ChipGPT improves programmability, and controllability, and shows broader design optimization space compared to prior work and native LLMs alone.

<title>Leveraging Twitter Data for Sentiment Analysis of Transit User Feedback: An NLP Framework</title>

Abstract: Traditional methods of collecting user feedback through transit surveys are often time-consuming, resource intensive, and costly. In this paper, we propose a novel NLP-based framework that harnesses the vast, abundant, and inexpensive data available on social media platforms like Twitter to understand users' perceptions of various service issues. Twitter, being a microblogging platform, hosts a wealth of real-time user-generated content that often includes valuable feedback and opinions on various products, services, and experiences. The proposed framework streamlines the process of gathering and analyzing user feedback without the need for costly and time-consuming user feedback surveys using two techniques. First, it utilizes few-shot learning for tweet classification within predefined categories, allowing effective identification of the issues described in tweets. It then employs a lexicon-based sentiment analysis model to assess the intensity and polarity of the tweet sentiments, distinguishing between positive, negative, and neutral tweets. The effectiveness of the framework was validated on a subset of manually labeled Twitter data and was applied to the NYC subway system as a case study. The framework accurately classifies tweets into predefined categories related to safety, reliability, and maintenance of the subway system and effectively measured sentiment intensities within each category. The general findings were corroborated through a comparison with an agency-run customer survey conducted in the same year. The findings highlight the effectiveness of the proposed framework in gauging user feedback through inexpensive social media data to understand the pain points of the transit system and plan for targeted improvements.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are nowadays expected to generate content aligned with human preferences. Current work focuses on alignment at model training time, through techniques such as Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). However, it is unclear if such methods are an effective choice to teach alignment objectives to the model. First, the inability to incorporate multiple, custom rewards and reliance on a model developer's view of universal and static principles are key limitations. Second, the reliability of such approaches is also questionable (e.g. susceptibility to jailbreaking even after safety training). To address these issues, we propose DeAL, a framework that allows the user to customize reward functions and enables Decoding-time Alignment of LLMs (DeAL). At its core, we view decoding as a heuristic-guided search process and facilitate the use of a wide variety of alignment objectives. Our experiments with programmatic constraints such as keyword and length constraints, and abstract objectives such as harmlessness and helpfulness, show that we can DeAL with fine-grained trade-offs and improve adherence to alignment objectives. Lastly, we demonstrate that DeAL is largely complementary to existing alignment strategies, and can be effectively paired with RLHF and prompting techniques to achieve better alignment.

Abstract: Gradient Inversion Attacks invert the transmitted gradients in Federated Learning (FL) systems to reconstruct the sensitive data of local clients and have raised considerable privacy concerns. A majority of gradient inversion methods rely heavily on explicit prior knowledge (e.g., a well pre-trained generative model), which is often unavailable in realistic scenarios. This is because real-world client data distributions are often highly heterogeneous, domain-specific, and unavailable to attackers, making it impractical for attackers to obtain perfectly matched pre-trained models, which inevitably suffer from fundamental distribution shifts relative to target private data. To alleviate this issue, researchers have proposed to leverage the implicit prior knowledge of an over-parameterized network. However, they only utilize a fixed neural architecture for all the attack settings. This would hinder the adaptive use of implicit architectural priors and consequently limit the generalizability. In this paper, we further exploit such implicit prior knowledge by proposing Gradient Inversion via Neural Architecture Search (GI-NAS), which adaptively searches the network and captures the implicit priors behind neural architectures. Extensive experiments verify that our proposed GI-NAS can achieve superior attack performance compared to state-of-the-art gradient inversion methods, even under more practical settings with high-resolution images, large-sized batches, and advanced defense strategies. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to successfully introduce NAS to the gradient inversion community. We believe that this work exposes critical vulnerabilities in real-world federated learning by demonstrating high-fidelity reconstruction of sensitive data without requiring domain-specific priors, forcing urgent reassessment of FL privacy safeguards.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability (MI) is an emerging sub-field of interpretability that seeks to understand a neural network model by reverse-engineering its internal computations. Recently, MI has garnered significant attention for interpreting transformer-based language models (LMs), resulting in many novel insights yet introducing new challenges. However, there has not been work that comprehensively reviews these insights and challenges, particularly as a guide for newcomers to this field. To fill this gap, we provide a comprehensive survey from a task-centric perspective, organizing the taxonomy of MI research around specific research questions or tasks. We outline the fundamental objects of study in MI, along with the techniques, evaluation methods, and key findings for each task in the taxonomy. In particular, we present a task-centric taxonomy as a roadmap for beginners to navigate the field by helping them quickly identify impactful problems in which they are most interested and leverage MI for their benefit. Finally, we discuss the current gaps in the field and suggest potential future directions for MI research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, but still struggle with processing extensive contexts, limiting their ability to maintain coherence and accuracy over long sequences. In contrast, the human brain excels at organising and retrieving episodic experiences across vast temporal scales, spanning a lifetime. In this work, we introduce EM-LLM, a novel approach that integrates key aspects of human episodic memory and event cognition into LLMs with no fine-tuning, enabling them to handle practically infinite context lengths while maintaining computational efficiency. EM-LLM organises sequences of tokens into coherent episodic events using a combination of Bayesian surprise and graph-theoretic boundary refinement in an online fashion. When needed, these events are retrieved through a two-stage memory process, combining similarity-based and temporally contiguous retrieval for efficient, human-inspired access to relevant information. Experiments on the LongBench and $\infty$-Bench benchmarks demonstrate EM-LLM's superior performance, consistently outperforming the state-of-the-art retrieval model InfLLM across various baseline LLMs. In addition, EM-LLM outperforms its popular counterpart, RAG, in a wide range of tasks, while requiring similar resources. Notably, EM-LLM's performance even surpasses full-context models in most tasks, while successfully performing retrieval across 10 million tokens -- a scale computationally infeasible for such models. Finally, our analysis reveals strong correlations between EM-LLM's event segmentation and human-perceived events, suggesting parallels between this artificial system and its biological counterpart, thereby offering a novel computational framework for exploring human memory mechanisms.

Abstract: Vision-language instruction-tuning models have recently achieved significant performance improvements. In this work, we discover that large-scale 3D parallel training on those models leads to an imbalanced computation load across different devices. The vision and language parts are inherently heterogeneous: their data distribution and model architecture differ significantly, which affects distributed training efficiency. To address this issue, we rebalance the computational load from data, model, and memory perspectives, achieving more balanced computation across devices. Specifically, for the data, instances are grouped into new balanced mini-batches within and across devices. A search-based method is employed for the model to achieve a more balanced partitioning. For memory optimization, we adaptively adjust the re-computation strategy for each partition to utilize the available memory fully. These three perspectives are not independent but are closely connected, forming an omniverse balanced training framework. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our method. Compared with the open-source training code of InternVL-Chat, training time is reduced greatly, achieving about 1.8$\times$ speed-up. Our method's efficacy and generalizability are further validated across various models and datasets. Codes will be released at https://github.com/ModelTC/OmniBal.

Abstract: Accurate classification of cancer-related biomedical abstracts is critical for advancing cancer informatics and supporting decision-making in healthcare research. Yet progress in this domain is often constrained by limited availability of labeled corpora and the high computational demands of transformer-based approaches. To address these challenges, we propose a Residual Graph Attention Network (R-GAT) that integrates multi-head attention with residual connections to capture semantic and relational dependencies in biomedical texts. Evaluated on a curated dataset of 1,875 PubMed abstracts spanning thyroid, colon, lung, and generic cancer topics, R-GAT achieves stable and competitive performance, comparable to transformer-based models such as BioBERT and BioClinicalBERT and strong classical baselines like Logistic Regression, while requiring significantly fewer computational resources. Ablation studies confirm the importance of attention and residual connections in ensuring robustness under limited-data conditions. To support reproducibility and facilitate future research, we also release the curated dataset. Together, these contributions demonstrate the value of lightweight graph-based architectures as reliable and resource-efficient alternatives to computationally intensive transformers in biomedical NLP.

Abstract: Scientific diagrams are vital tools for communicating structured knowledge across disciplines. However, they are often published as static raster images, losing symbolic semantics and limiting reuse. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a pathway to bridging vision and structure, existing methods lack semantic control and structural interpretability, especially on complex diagrams. We propose Draw with Thought (DwT), a training-free framework that guides MLLMs to reconstruct diagrams into editable mxGraph XML code through cognitively-grounded Chain-of-Thought reasoning. DwT enables interpretable and controllable outputs without model fine-tuning by dividing the task into two stages: Coarse-to-Fine Planning, which handles perceptual structuring and semantic specification, and Structure-Aware Code Generation, enhanced by format-guided refinement. To support evaluation, we release Plot2XML, a benchmark of 247 real-world scientific diagrams with gold-standard XML annotations. Extensive experiments across eight MLLMs show that our approach yields high-fidelity, semantically aligned, and structurally valid reconstructions, with human evaluations confirming strong alignment in both accuracy and visual aesthetics, offering a scalable solution for converting static visuals into executable representations and advancing machine understanding of scientific graphics.

<title>Does Reinforcement Learning Really Incentivize Reasoning Capacity in LLMs Beyond the Base Model?</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently demonstrated notable success in enhancing the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), particularly on mathematics and programming tasks. Similar to how traditional RL helps agents explore and learn new strategies, RLVR is believed to enable LLMs to continuously self-improve, thus acquiring novel reasoning abilities beyond those of the corresponding base models. In this study we critically examine the current state of RLVR by systematically probing the reasoning capability boundaries of RLVR-trained LLMs across various model families, RL algorithms, and math, coding, and visual reasoning benchmarks, using pass@k at large k values as the evaluation metric. Surprisingly, we find that the current training setup does not elicit fundamentally new reasoning patterns. While RLVR-trained models outperform their base models at small k (e.g., k = 1), the base models achieve a higher pass@k score when k is large. Coverage and perplexity analyses show that the observed reasoning abilities originate from and are bounded by the base model. Treating the base model as an upper bound, our quantitative analysis shows that six popular RLVR algorithms perform similarly and remain far from optimal in leveraging the potential of the base model. By contrast, we find that distillation can introduce new reasoning patterns from the teacher and genuinely expand the model's reasoning capabilities. Overall, our findings suggest that current RLVR methods have not yet realized the potential of RL to elicit truly novel reasoning abilities in LLMs. This highlights the need for improved RL paradigms, such as continual scaling and multi-turn agent-environment interaction, to unlock this potential.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities in code-related tasks, but their robustness in code reasoning under perturbations remains underexplored. We introduce CodeCrash, a stress-testing framework with 1,279 questions from CruxEval and LiveCodeBench, designed to evaluate reasoning reliability under structural perturbations and misleading natural language (NL) contexts. Through a systematic evaluation of 17 LLMs, we find that models often shortcut reasoning by over-relying on NL cues, leading to an average performance degradation of 23.2% in output prediction tasks. Even with Chain-of-Thought reasoning, models on average still have a 13.8% drop due to distractibility and rationalization, revealing a lack of critical reasoning capability to distinguish the actual code behaviors. While Large Reasoning Models with internal reasoning mechanisms improve robustness by fostering critical thinking, plausible yet incorrect hints can trigger pathological self-reflection, causing 2-3 times token consumption and even catastrophic cognitive dissonance in extreme cases for QwQ-32B. We refer to this phenomenon as Reasoning Collapse. CodeCrash provides a rigorous benchmark for evaluating robustness in code reasoning, guiding future research and development toward more reliable and resilient models.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely adopted paradigm for enabling knowledge-grounded large language models (LLMs). However, standard RAG pipelines often fail to ensure that model reasoning remains consistent with the evidence retrieved, leading to factual inconsistencies or unsupported conclusions. In this work, we reinterpret RAG as Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning and identify a central but underexplored problem: Reasoning Misalignment -- the divergence between an LLM's internal reasoning trajectory and the evidential constraints provided by retrieval. To address this issue, we propose AlignRAG, a novel iterative framework grounded in Critique-Driven Alignment (CDA). We further introduce AlignRAG-auto, an autonomous variant that dynamically terminates refinement, removing the need to pre-specify the number of critique iterations. At the heart of AlignRAG lies a contrastive critique synthesis mechanism that generates retrieval-sensitive critiques while mitigating self-bias. This mechanism trains a dedicated retrieval-augmented Critic Language Model (CLM) using labeled critiques that distinguish between evidence-aligned and misaligned reasoning. Empirical evaluations show that our approach significantly improves reasoning fidelity. Our 8B-parameter CLM improves performance over the Self-Refine baseline by 12.1% on out-of-domain tasks and outperforms a standard 72B-parameter CLM by 2.2%. Furthermore, AlignRAG-auto achieves this state-of-the-art performance while dynamically determining the optimal number of refinement steps, enhancing efficiency and usability. AlignRAG remains compatible with existing RAG architectures as a plug-and-play module and demonstrates strong robustness under both informative and noisy retrieval scenarios.

Abstract: Association Rule Mining (ARM) is the task of mining patterns among data features in the form of logical rules, with applications across a myriad of domains. However, high-dimensional datasets often result in an excessive number of rules, increasing execution time and negatively impacting downstream task performance. Managing this rule explosion remains a central challenge in ARM research. To address this, we introduce Aerial+, a novel neurosymbolic ARM method. Aerial+ leverages an under-complete autoencoder to create a neural representation of the data, capturing associations between features. It extracts rules from this neural representation by exploiting the model's reconstruction mechanism. Extensive evaluations on five datasets against seven baselines demonstrate that Aerial+ achieves state-of-the-art results by learning more concise, high-quality rule sets with full data coverage. When integrated into rule-based interpretable machine learning models, Aerial+ significantly reduces execution time while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Abstract: Despite their ability to understand chemical knowledge, large language models (LLMs) remain limited in their capacity to propose novel molecules with desired functions (e.g., drug-like properties). In addition, the molecules that LLMs propose can often be challenging to make, and are almost never compatible with automated synthesis approaches. To better enable the discovery of functional small molecules, LLMs need to learn a new molecular language that is more effective in predicting properties and inherently synced with automated synthesis technology. Current molecule LLMs are limited by representing molecules based on atoms. In this paper, we argue that just like tokenizing texts into meaning-bearing (sub-)word tokens instead of characters, molecules should be tokenized at the level of functional building blocks, i.e., parts of molecules that bring unique functions and serve as effective building blocks for real-world automated laboratory synthesis. This motivates us to propose mCLM, a modular Chemical-Language Model that comprises a bilingual language model that understands both natural language descriptions of functions and molecular blocks. mCLM front-loads synthesizability considerations while improving the predicted functions of molecules in a principled manner. mCLM, with only 3B parameters, achieves improvements in synthetic accessibility relative to 7 other leading generative AI methods including GPT-5. When tested on 122 out-of-distribution medicines using only building blocks/tokens that are compatible with automated modular synthesis, mCLM outperforms all baselines in property scores and synthetic accessibility. mCLM can also reason on multiple functions and iteratively self-improve to rescue drug candidates that failed late in clinical trials ("fallen angels").

Abstract: Memory is a critical component in large language model (LLM)-based agents, enabling them to store and retrieve past executions to improve task performance over time. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on how memory management choices impact the LLM agents' behavior, especially their long-term performance. Specifically, we focus on two fundamental memory management operations that are widely used by many agent frameworks-memory addition and deletion-to systematically study their impact on the agent behavior. Through our quantitative analysis, we find that LLM agents display an experience-following property: high similarity between a task input and the input in a retrieved memory record often results in highly similar agent outputs. Our analysis further reveals two significant challenges associated with this property: error propagation, where inaccuracies in past experiences compound and degrade future performance, and misaligned experience replay, where some seemingly correct executions can provide limited or even misleading value as experiences. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate the importance of regulating experience quality within the memory bank and show that future task evaluations can serve as free quality labels for stored memory. Our findings offer insights into the behavioral dynamics of LLM agent memory systems and provide practical guidance for designing memory components that support robust, long-term agent performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a variety of mathematical benchmarks. However, concerns remain as to whether these successes reflect genuine reasoning or superficial pattern recognition. Common evaluation methods, which focus on the either the final answer or the reasoning process, fail to assess the entire problem-solving procedure. To address these limitations, we introduce SMART: a Self-Generating and Self-Validating Multi-Dimensional Assessment Framework, together with its corresponding benchmark, SMART-Bench. SMART decomposes the entire problem solving process into four distinct cognitive dimensions: Understanding, Reasoning, Arithmetic, and Reflection \& Refinement. Each dimension is evaluated independently through tailored tasks, enabling interpretable and fine-grained analysis of LLM behavior. We apply SMART to 21 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source LLMs, uncovering significant discrepancies in their abilities across different dimensions. Our findings reveal genuine weaknesses in current LLMs and motivate a new metric, the All-Pass Score, to better capture true problem-solving capabilities. Code and benchmarks will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve from passive text generators to active reasoning agents capable of interacting with external tools, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a key standardized framework for dynamic tool discovery and orchestration. Despite its widespread industry adoption, existing evaluation methods do not adequately assess tool utilization capabilities under this new paradigm. To address this gap, this paper introduces MCP-RADAR, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLM performance within the MCP framework. MCP-RADAR features a challenging dataset of 507 tasks spanning six domains: mathematical reasoning, web search, email, calendar, file management, and terminal operations. It quantifies performance based on two primary criteria: answer correctness and operational accuracy. To closely emulate real-world usage, our evaluation employs both authentic MCP tools and high-fidelity simulations of official tools. Unlike traditional benchmarks that rely on subjective human evaluation or binary success metrics, MCP-RADAR adopts objective, quantifiable measurements across multiple task domains, including computational resource efficiency and the number of successful tool-invocation rounds. Our evaluation of leading closed-source and open-source LLMs reveals distinct capability profiles and highlights a significant trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Our findings provide actionable insights for both LLM developers and tool creators, establishing a standardized methodology applicable to the broader LLM agent ecosystem. All implementations, configurations, and datasets are publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MCPRadar-B143.

Abstract: Temporal reasoning and planning are essential capabilities for large language models (LLMs), yet most existing benchmarks evaluate them in isolation and under limited forms of complexity. To address this gap, we introduce the Temporal Constraint-based Planning (TCP) benchmark that jointly assesses both capabilities. Each instance in TCP features a naturalistic dialogue around a collaborative project, where diverse and interdependent temporal constraints are explicitly or implicitly expressed, and models must infer an optimal schedule that satisfies all constraints. To construct TCP, we generate abstract problem prototypes that are then paired with realistic scenarios from various domains and enriched into dialogues using an LLM. A human quality check is performed on a sampled subset to confirm the reliability of our benchmark. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs and find that even the strongest models may struggle with TCP, highlighting its difficulty and revealing limitations in LLMs' temporal constraint-based planning abilities. We analyze underlying failure cases, open source our benchmark, and hope our findings can inspire future research.

Abstract: The ability of AI to sense and identify various substances based on their smell alone can have profound impacts on allergen detection (e.g., smelling gluten or peanuts in a cake), monitoring the manufacturing process, and sensing hormones that indicate emotional states, stress levels, and diseases. Despite these broad impacts, there are virtually no large-scale benchmarks, and therefore little progress, for training and evaluating AI systems' ability to smell in the real world. In this paper, we use small gas and chemical sensors to create SmellNet, the first large-scale database that digitizes a diverse range of smells in the natural world. SmellNet contains about 828,000 data points across 50 substances, spanning nuts, spices, herbs, fruits, and vegetables, and 43 mixtures among them, with 68 hours of data collected. Using SmellNet, we developed ScentFormer, a Transformer-based architecture combining temporal differencing and sliding-window augmentation for smell data. For the SmellNet-Base classification task, ScentFormer achieves 58.5% Top-1 accuracy, and for the SmellNet-Mixture distribution prediction task, ScentFormer achieves 50.2% Top-1@0.1 on the test-seen split. ScentFormer's ability to generalize across conditions and capture transient chemical dynamics demonstrates the promise of temporal modeling in olfactory AI. SmellNet and ScentFormer lay the groundwork for real-world olfactory applications across healthcare, food and beverage, environmental monitoring, manufacturing, and entertainment.

Abstract: We address the long-horizon gap in large language model (LLM) agents by enabling them to sustain coherent strategies in adversarial, stochastic environments. Settlers of Catan provides a challenging benchmark: success depends on balancing short- and long-term goals amid randomness, trading, expansion, and blocking. Prompt-centric LLM agents (e.g., ReAct, Reflexion) must re-interpret large, evolving game states each turn, quickly saturating context windows and losing strategic consistency. We propose HexMachina, a continual learning multi-agent system that separates environment discovery (inducing an adapter layer without documentation) from strategy improvement (evolving a compiled player through code refinement and simulation). This design preserves executable artifacts, allowing the LLM to focus on high-level strategy rather than per-turn reasoning. In controlled Catanatron experiments, HexMachina learns from scratch and evolves players that outperform the strongest human-crafted baseline (AlphaBeta), achieving a 54% win rate and surpassing prompt-driven and no-discovery baselines. Ablations confirm that isolating pure strategy learning improves performance. Overall, artifact-centric continual learning transforms LLMs from brittle stepwise deciders into stable strategy designers, advancing long-horizon autonomy.

Abstract: Unlike reasoning, which often entails a deep sequence of deductive steps, complex real-world planning is characterized by the need to synthesize a broad spectrum of parallel and potentially conflicting information and constraints. For example, in travel planning scenarios, it requires the integration of diverse real-world information and user preferences. While LLMs show promise, existing methods with long-horizon thinking struggle with handling multifaceted constraints, leading to suboptimal solutions. Motivated by the challenges of real-world travel planning, this paper introduces the Multiple Aspects of Planning (MAoP), empowering LLMs with "wide-horizon thinking" to solve planning problems with multifaceted constraints. Instead of direct planning, MAoP leverages the strategist to conduct pre-planning from various aspects and provide the planning blueprint for planners, enabling strong inference-time scalability by scaling aspects to consider various constraints. In addition, existing benchmarks for multi-constraint planning are flawed because they assess constraints in isolation, ignoring causal dependencies within the constraints, e.g, travel planning, where past activities dictate future itinerary. To address this, we propose Travel-Sim, an agent-based benchmark assessing plans via real-world simulation, thereby inherently resolving these causal dependencies. This paper advances LLM capabilities in complex planning and offers novel insights for evaluating sophisticated scenarios through simulation.

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) have enabled strong chain-of-thought (CoT) generation through test-time computation. While these multi-step reasoning capabilities represent a major milestone in language model performance, they also introduce new safety risks. In this work, we present the first systematic study to revisit the problem of machine unlearning in the context of LRMs. Machine unlearning refers to the process of removing the influence of sensitive, harmful, or undesired data or knowledge from a trained model without full retraining. We show that conventional unlearning algorithms, originally designed for non-reasoning models, are inadequate for LRMs. In particular, even when final answers are successfully erased, sensitive information often persists within the intermediate reasoning steps, i.e., CoT trajectories. To address this challenge, we extend conventional unlearning and propose Reasoning-aware Representation Misdirection for Unlearning ($R^2MU$), a novel method that effectively suppresses sensitive reasoning traces and prevents the generation of associated final answers, while preserving the model's reasoning ability. Our experiments demonstrate that $R^2MU$ significantly reduces sensitive information leakage within reasoning traces and achieves strong performance across both safety and reasoning benchmarks, evaluated on state-of-the-art models such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA-8B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B.

Abstract: The long-standing goal of creating a comprehensive, multi-purpose knowledge resource, reminiscent of the 1984 Cyc project, still persists in AI. Despite the success of knowledge resources like WordNet, ConceptNet, Wolfram|Alpha and other commercial knowledge graphs, verifiable, general-purpose widely available sources of knowledge remain a critical deficiency in AI infrastructure. Large language models struggle due to knowledge gaps; robotic planning lacks necessary world knowledge; and the detection of factually false information relies heavily on human expertise. What kind of knowledge resource is most needed in AI today? How can modern technology shape its development and evaluation? A recent AAAI workshop gathered over 50 researchers to explore these questions. This paper synthesizes our findings and outlines a community-driven vision for a new knowledge infrastructure. In addition to leveraging contemporary advances in knowledge representation and reasoning, one promising idea is to build an open engineering framework to exploit knowledge modules effectively within the context of practical applications. Such a framework should include sets of conventions and social structures that are adopted by contributors.

<title>Beyond Parameters: Exploring Virtual Logic Depth for Scaling Laws</title>

Abstract: Scaling large language models typically involves three dimensions: depth, width, and parameter count. In this work, we explore a fourth dimension, \textbf{virtual logical depth} (VLD), which increases effective algorithmic depth without changing parameter count by reusing weights. While parameter reuse is not new, its role in scaling has been underexplored. Unlike recent test-time methods that scale token-wise, VLD alters the internal computation graph during training and inference. Through controlled experiments, we obtain three key insights. (1) \textit{Knowledge capacity vs. parameters}: at fixed parameter count, VLD leaves knowledge capacity nearly unchanged, while across models capacity still scales with parameters. (2) \textit{Reasoning vs. reuse}: properly implemented VLD substantially improves reasoning ability \emph{without} more parameters, decoupling reasoning from size. This suggests a new scaling path beyond token-wise test-time methods. (3) \textit{Robustness and generality}: reasoning gains persist across architectures and reuse schedules, showing VLD captures a general scaling behavior. These results provide insight into future scaling strategies and raise a deeper question: does superintelligence require ever-larger models, or can it be achieved by reusing parameters and increasing logical depth? We argue many unknown dynamics in scaling remain to be explored. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/virtual_logical_depth-8024/.

<title>Can Prompt Difficulty be Online Predicted for Accelerating RL Finetuning of Reasoning Models?</title>

Abstract: Recent advances have witnessed the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL) finetuning in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The optimization process often requires numerous iterations to achieve satisfactory performance, resulting in high computational costs due to the need for frequent prompt evaluations under intensive LLM interactions and repeated policy updates. Appropriate online prompt selection methods reduce iteration steps by prioritizing informative prompts during training, while the pipeline's reliance on exhaustive prompt evaluation and subset selection for optimization still incurs substantial computational overhead due to frequent LLM inference calls. Distinguished from these direct evaluate-then-select schemes, this work investigates iterative approximate evaluation for arbitrary prompts and introduces Model Predictive Prompt Selection (MoPPS), a Bayesian risk-predictive framework that online estimates prompt difficulty without requiring costly LLM interactions. Technically, MoPPS models each prompt's success rate as a latent variable, performs streaming Bayesian inference, and employs posterior sampling in a constructed multi-armed bandit machine, enabling sample efficient and adaptive prompt selection. Extensive experiments across mathematics, planning, and vision-based geometry tasks show that MoPPS reliably predicts prompt difficulty and accelerates training with significantly reduced LLM rollouts. Our code is available at https://github.com/thu-rllab/MoPPS.

Abstract: A space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) for Internet of Things (IoT) network architecture is investigated, empowered by multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (MF-RIS) capable of simultaneously reflecting, amplifying, and harvesting wireless energy. The MF-RIS plays a pivotal role in addressing the energy shortages of low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites operating in the shadowed regions, while accounting for both communication and computing energy consumption across the SAGIN nodes. To maximize the long-term energy efficiency (EE) of IoT devices, we formulate a joint optimization problem over the MF-RIS parameters, including signal amplification, phase-shifts, energy harvesting ratio, and active element selection as well as the SAGIN parameters of beamforming vectors, high-altitude platform station (HAPS) deployment, IoT device association, and computing capability. The formulated problem is highly non-convex and non-linear and contains mixed discrete-continuous parameters. To tackle this, we conceive a compressed hybrid twin-model enhanced multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (CHIMERA) framework, which integrates semantic state-action compression and parametrized sharing under hybrid reinforcement learning to efficiently explore suitable complex actions. The simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed CHIMERA scheme substantially outperforms the conventional benchmarks, including fixed-configuration or non-harvesting MF-RIS, traditional RIS, and no-RIS cases, as well as centralized and multi-agent deep reinforcement learning baselines in terms of the highest EE. Moreover, the proposed SAGIN-MF-RIS architecture in IoT network achieves superior EE performance due to its complementary coverage, offering notable advantages over either standalone satellite, aerial, or ground-only deployments.

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning with vision-language models (VLMs) often suffers from hallucinations, as models tend to generate explanations after only a superficial inspection of the image. We present \textbf{CoRGI}(\textbf{C}hain \textbf{o}f \textbf{R}easoning with \textbf{G}rounded \textbf{I}nsights), a framework that enhances reasoning reliability through post-hoc verification of chain-of-thought outputs. Given a VLM-generated rationale, CoRGI decomposes it into step-wise statements, grounds each step in visual evidence, and filters or corrects unsupported claims before producing the final answer. Experiments on five challenging benchmark-VCR, ScienceQA, MMMU, MathVista, and HallusionBenc-demonstrate that CoRGI consistently improves both answer accuracy and explanation faithfulness across multiple VLM backbones, including Qwen-2.5VL, LLaVA-1.6, and Gemma3-12B. Beyond quantitative gains, qualitative analyses further illustrate how the verification process reduces hallucination and strengthens interpretability, suggesting that post-hoc visual grounding is a promising direction for building more trustworthy and transparent multimodal reasoning systems.

Abstract: Despite their strong performance in multimodal emotion reasoning, existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often overlook the scenarios involving emotion conflicts, where emotional cues from different modalities are inconsistent. To fill this gap, we first introduce CA-MER, a new benchmark designed to examine MLLMs under realistic emotion conflicts. It consists of three subsets: video-aligned, audio-aligned, and consistent, where only one or all modalities reflect the true emotion. However, evaluations on our CA-MER reveal that current state-of-the-art emotion MLLMs systematically over-rely on audio signal during emotion conflicts, neglecting critical cues from visual modality. To mitigate this bias, we propose MoSEAR, a parameter-efficient framework that promotes balanced modality integration. MoSEAR consists of two modules: (1)MoSE, modality-specific experts with a regularized gating mechanism that reduces modality bias in the fine-tuning heads; and (2)AR, an attention reallocation mechanism that rebalances modality contributions in frozen backbones during inference. Our framework offers two key advantages: it mitigates emotion conflicts and improves performance on consistent samples-without incurring a trade-off between audio and visual modalities. Experiments on multiple benchmarks-including MER2023, EMER, DFEW, and our CA-MER-demonstrate that MoSEAR achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly under modality conflict conditions.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of scientific knowledge presents a grand challenge: transforming this vast repository of information into an active engine for discovery, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare. Current AI agents, however, are constrained by static, predefined strategies, limiting their ability to navigate the complex, evolving ecosystem of scientific research. This paper introduces HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and failures into a durable, structured knowledge base, enabling it to learn not just how to use tools, but how to strategize. To anchor our research and provide a community resource, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark featuring complex health data analysis tasks systematically derived from peer-reviewed scientific literature. Our experiments demonstrate that HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art agent frameworks. This work offers a new paradigm for intelligent systems that can learn to operationalize the procedural knowledge embedded in scientific content, marking a critical step toward more autonomous and effective AI for healthcare scientific discovery.

Abstract: Complex medical decision-making involves cooperative workflows operated by different clinicians. Designing AI multi-agent systems can expedite and augment human-level clinical decision-making. Existing multi-agent researches primarily focus on language-only tasks, yet their extension to multimodal scenarios remains challenging. A blind combination of diverse vision-language models (VLMs) can amplify an erroneous outcome interpretation. VLMs in general are less capable in instruction following and importantly self-reflection, compared to large language models (LLMs) of comparable sizes. This disparity largely constrains VLMs' ability in cooperative workflows. In this study, we propose MedOrch, a mediator-guided multi-agent collaboration framework for medical multimodal decision-making. MedOrch employs an LLM-based mediator agent that enables multiple VLM-based expert agents to exchange and reflect on their outputs towards collaboration. We utilize multiple open-source general-purpose and domain-specific VLMs instead of costly GPT-series models, revealing the strength of heterogeneous models. We show that the collaboration within distinct VLM-based agents can surpass the capabilities of any individual agent. We validate our approach on five medical vision question answering benchmarks, demonstrating superior collaboration performance without model training. Our findings underscore the value of mediator-guided multi-agent collaboration in advancing medical multimodal intelligence.

Abstract: Forecasting future links is a central task in temporal graph (TG) reasoning, requiring models to leverage historical interactions to predict upcoming ones. Traditional neural approaches, such as temporal graph neural networks, achieve strong performance but lack explainability and cannot be applied to unseen graphs without retraining. Recent studies have begun to explore using large language models (LLMs) for graph reasoning, but most of them are constrained to static graphs or small synthetic TGs and lack the evaluation of the quality of reasoning traces generated by LLMs. In this work, we present Reasoning-Enhanced Learning for Temporal Graphs (ReaL-TG), a reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes LLMs to perform explainable link forecasting on real-world TGs. ReaL-TG uses outcome-based reward to encourage models to self-explore reasoning strategies from graph structure and to produce explanations that directly justify their predictions. To enable evaluation on LLM-generated reasoning traces, we propose a new evaluation protocol combining ranking metrics with an LLM-as-a-Judge system that assesses both the quality of reasoning and the impact of hallucinations. Experiments with ReaL-TG-4B, obtained by fine-tuning Qwen3-4B under our framework, show that it outperforms much larger frontier LLMs, including GPT-5 mini, on ranking metrics, while producing high-quality explanations confirmed by both the LLM judge and human evaluation.

Abstract: Recent research on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated that agents can engage in \textit{complex}, \textit{multi-turn} negotiations, opening new avenues for agentic AI. However, existing LLM agents largely overlook the functional role of emotions in such negotiations, instead generating passive, preference-driven emotional responses that make them vulnerable to manipulation and strategic exploitation by adversarial counterparts. To address this gap, we present EvoEmo, an evolutionary reinforcement learning framework that optimizes dynamic emotional expression in negotiations. EvoEmo models emotional state transitions as a Markov Decision Process and employs population-based genetic optimization to evolve high-reward emotion policies across diverse negotiation scenarios. We further propose an evaluation framework with two baselines -- vanilla strategies and fixed-emotion strategies -- for benchmarking emotion-aware negotiation. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that EvoEmo consistently outperforms both baselines, achieving higher success rates, higher efficiency, and increased buyer savings. This findings highlight the importance of adaptive emotional expression in enabling more effective LLM agents for multi-turn negotiation.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems have shown strong capabilities across various tasks. However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on static or task-level workflows, which either over-process simple queries or underperform on complex ones, while also neglecting the efficiency-performance trade-offs across heterogeneous LLMs. To address these limitations, we propose Difficulty-Aware Agentic Orchestration (DAAO), which can dynamically generate query-specific multi-agent workflows guided by predicted query difficulty. DAAO comprises three interdependent modules: a variational autoencoder (VAE) for difficulty estimation, a modular operator allocator, and a cost- and performance-aware LLM router. A self-adjusting policy updates difficulty estimates based on workflow success, enabling simpler workflows for easy queries and more complex strategies for harder ones. Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that DAAO surpasses prior multi-agent systems in both accuracy and inference efficiency, validating its effectiveness for adaptive, difficulty-aware reasoning.

Abstract: This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) self-management. We constructed a database of approximately 3,000 anteroposterior X-rays with diagnostic texts and evaluated five MLLMs through a `Divide and Conquer' framework consisting of a visual question-answering task, a domain knowledge assessment task, and a patient education counseling assessment task. Our investigation revealed limitations of MLLMs' ability in interpreting complex spinal radiographs and comprehending AIS care knowledge. To address these, we pioneered enhancing MLLMs with spinal keypoint prompting and compiled an AIS knowledge base for retrieval augmented generation (RAG), respectively. Results showed varying effectiveness of visual prompting across different architectures, while RAG substantially improved models' performances on the knowledge assessment task. Our findings indicate current MLLMs are far from capable in realizing personalized assistant in AIS care. The greatest challenge lies in their abilities to obtain accurate detections of spinal deformity locations (best accuracy: 0.55) and directions (best accuracy: 0.13).

Abstract: Current AI alignment through RLHF follows a single directional paradigm that AI conforms to human preferences while treating human cognition as fixed. We propose a shift to co-alignment through Bidirectional Cognitive Alignment (BiCA), where humans and AI mutually adapt. BiCA uses learnable protocols, representation mapping, and KL-budget constraints for controlled co-evolution. In collaborative navigation, BiCA achieved 85.5% success versus 70.3% baseline, with 230% better mutual adaptation and 332% better protocol convergence. Emergent protocols outperformed handcrafted ones by 84%, while bidirectional adaptation unexpectedly improved safety (+23% out-of-distribution robustness). The 46% synergy improvement demonstrates optimal collaboration exists at the intersection, not union, of human and AI capabilities, validating the shift from single-directional to co-alignment paradigms.

Abstract: Operations research (OR) provides fundamental methodologies for complex system decision-making, with established applications in transportation, supply chain management, and production scheduling. Traditional approaches, which depend on expert-based modeling and manual parameter adjustment, often face challenges in handling large-scale, dynamic, and multi-constraint problems. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown potential to address these limitations through semantic understanding, structured generation, and reasoning control. LLMs can translate natural language descriptions into mathematical models or executable code, generate heuristics, evolve algorithms, and directly tackle optimization tasks. This paper surveys recent progress on the integration of LLMs into OR, organizing methods into three main directions: automatic modeling, auxiliary optimization, and direct solving. It further reviews evaluation benchmarks and domain-specific applications, and summarizes key open issues such as unstable semantic-to-structure mapping, fragmented research progress, limited generalization, and insufficient evaluation systems. Finally, the survey outlines possible research avenues for advancing the role of LLMs in OR.

<title>Coordination Requires Simplification: Thermodynamic Bounds on Multi-Objective Compromise in Natural and Artificial Intelligence</title>

Abstract: Information-processing systems coordinating across multiple agents and objectives face fundamental thermodynamic constraints. We show that solutions with maximum utility to act as coordination focal points have much higher selection pressure for being findable across agents rather than accuracy. We derive that the information-theoretic minimum description length of coordination protocols to precision $\varepsilon$ scales as $L(P)\geq NK\log_2 K+N^2d^2\log (1/\varepsilon)$ for $N$ agents with $d$ potentially conflicting objectives and internal model complexity $K$. This scaling forces progressive simplification, with coordination dynamics changing the environment itself and shifting optimization across hierarchical levels. Moving from established focal points requires re-coordination, creating persistent metastable states and hysteresis until significant environmental shifts trigger phase transitions through spontaneous symmetry breaking. We operationally define coordination temperature to predict critical phenomena and estimate coordination work costs, identifying measurable signatures across systems from neural networks to restaurant bills to bureaucracies. Extending the topological version of Arrow's theorem on the impossibility of consistent preference aggregation, we find it recursively binds whenever preferences are combined. This potentially explains the indefinite cycling in multi-objective gradient descent and alignment faking in Large Language Models trained with reinforcement learning with human feedback. We term this framework Thermodynamic Coordination Theory (TCT), which demonstrates that coordination requires radical information loss.

Abstract: Building autonomous agents capable of solving long-horizon, real-world tasks has garnered significant research interest. But outcome based rewards may cause reward miscalibration which means it might mistakenly allocate positive reward to flawed middle steps which is regarded as the key reason making the bad actions being reinforced during training. However we reveal that outcome based reward ensures expected negative advantage for those flawed middle steps, which means the flawed actions should be punished during training. Even accounting for the ``squeezing effect", the probability mass of good actions should increase and the actor should gradually get rid of harmful actions. This shows that flawed actions should be punished during training. We further identify gradient coupling between similar samples as a key issue in agentic RL, the input prompt is extremely similar and the output action space is limited, therefore during training, gradients from well-performing samples can inadvertently strengthen suboptimal or incorrect actions due to similar input observation and output actions. We show that with gradient coupling, some flawed actions might be enhanced. To address this, we propose training the actor to classify good or bad actions to separate the embedding of good/bad actions and alleviate the gradient interference, extensive experiments shows its effectiveness.

<title>From $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ to $f(g(x))$: LLMs Learn New Skills in RL by Composing Old Ones</title>

Abstract: Does RL teach LLMs genuinely new skills, or does it merely activate existing ones? This question lies at the core of ongoing debates about the role of RL in LLM post-training. On one side, strong empirical results can be achieved with RL even without preceding supervised finetuning; on the other, critics argue that RL contributes little beyond reweighting existing reasoning strategies. This work provides concrete evidence that LLMs can acquire genuinely new skills during RL by composing existing ones, mirroring one of the central mechanisms by which humans acquire new cognitive skills. To mitigate data contamination and other confounding factors, and to allow precise control over task complexity, we develop a synthetic framework for our investigation. Specifically, we define a skill as the ability to infer the output of a string transformation function f(x) given x. When an LLM has already learned f and g prior to RL, our experiments reveal that RL enables it to learn unseen compositions of them h(x)=g(f(x)). Further, this compositional ability generalizes to more difficult problems such as compositions of >2 functions unseen during RL training. Surprisingly, our experiments show that compositional skill acquired on a source task transfers to a different target task. This transfer happens even without compositional training on the target, requiring only prior knowledge of the target's atomic skills. Our qualitative analysis shows that RL fundamentally changes the reasoning behaviors of the models. In contrast, next-token training with the same data yields none of these findings. Our systematic experiments provide fresh insights into LLM learning, suggesting the value of first building base models with basic skills, then using RL to incentivize advanced, generalizable skills for complex problems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now widely used across many domains. With their rapid development, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has surged in recent months to enhance their reasoning and understanding abilities. However, its complex data flows and diverse tasks pose substantial challenges to RL training systems, and there is limited understanding of RLVR from a system perspective. To thoroughly understand the system challenges introduced by RLVR, we present a characterization study of RLVR tasks in our LLM deployment. Specifically, we investigate the distribution and variation trends of workloads across different RL tasks across training steps. We identify issues such as GPU idling caused by skewed sequence length distribution, inefficient parallel strategies in dynamically varying workloads, inefficient data management mechanisms, and load imbalance. We describe our observations and call for further investigation into the remaining open challenges. Furthermore, we propose PolyTrace benchmark suite to conduct evaluation with realistic workloads, and a practical use case validates that PolyTrace benchmark suite exhibits 94.7% accuracy.

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in robotics, industry, and health care is blocked by two obstacles: the difficulty of specifying accurate rewards and the risk of unsafe, data-hungry exploration. We address this by proposing a two-stage framework that first learns a safe initial policy from a reward-free dataset of expert demonstrations, then fine-tunes it online using preference-based human feedback. We provide the first principled analysis of this offline-to-online approach and introduce BRIDGE, a unified algorithm that integrates both signals via an uncertainty-weighted objective. We derive regret bounds that shrink with the number of offline demonstrations, explicitly connecting the quantity of offline data to online sample efficiency. We validate BRIDGE in discrete and continuous control MuJoCo environments, showing it achieves lower regret than both standalone behavioral cloning and online preference-based RL. Our work establishes a theoretical foundation for designing more sample-efficient interactive agents.

Abstract: As governments move to regulate AI, there is growing interest in using Large Language Models (LLMs) to assess whether or not an AI system complies with a given AI Regulation (AIR). However, there is presently no way to benchmark the performance of LLMs at this task. To fill this void, we introduce AIReg-Bench: the first benchmark dataset designed to test how well LLMs can assess compliance with the EU AI Act (AIA). We created this dataset through a two-step process: (1) by prompting an LLM with carefully structured instructions, we generated 120 technical documentation excerpts (samples), each depicting a fictional, albeit plausible, AI system - of the kind an AI provider might produce to demonstrate their compliance with AIR; (2) legal experts then reviewed and annotated each sample to indicate whether, and in what way, the AI system described therein violates specific Articles of the AIA. The resulting dataset, together with our evaluation of whether frontier LLMs can reproduce the experts' compliance labels, provides a starting point to understand the opportunities and limitations of LLM-based AIR compliance assessment tools and establishes a benchmark against which subsequent LLMs can be compared. The dataset and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/camlsys/aireg-bench.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates large language models (LLMs) with external sources, but unresolved contradictions in retrieved evidence often lead to hallucinations and legally unsound outputs. Benchmarks currently used for contradiction detection lack domain realism, cover only limited conflict types, and rarely extend beyond single-sentence pairs, making them unsuitable for legal applications. Controlled generation of documents with embedded contradictions is therefore essential: it enables systematic stress-testing of models, ensures coverage of diverse conflict categories, and provides a reliable basis for evaluating contradiction detection and resolution. We present a multi-agent contradiction-aware benchmark framework for the legal domain that generates synthetic legal-style documents, injects six structured contradiction types, and models both self- and pairwise inconsistencies. Automated contradiction mining is combined with human-in-the-loop validation to guarantee plausibility and fidelity. This benchmark offers one of the first structured resources for contradiction-aware evaluation in legal RAG pipelines, supporting more consistent, interpretable, and trustworthy systems.

<title>Decoding Emotion in the Deep: A Systematic Study of How LLMs Represent, Retain, and Express Emotion</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to navigate the nuances of human emotion. While research confirms that LLMs can simulate emotional intelligence, their internal emotional mechanisms remain largely unexplored. This paper investigates the latent emotional representations within modern LLMs by asking: how, where, and for how long is emotion encoded in their neural architecture? To address this, we introduce a novel, large-scale Reddit corpus of approximately 400,000 utterances, balanced across seven basic emotions through a multi-stage process of classification, rewriting, and synthetic generation. Using this dataset, we employ lightweight "probes" to read out information from the hidden layers of various Qwen3 and LLaMA models without altering their parameters. Our findings reveal that LLMs develop a surprisingly well-defined internal geometry of emotion, which sharpens with model scale and significantly outperforms zero-shot prompting. We demonstrate that this emotional signal is not a final-layer phenomenon but emerges early and peaks mid-network. Furthermore, the internal states are both malleable (they can be influenced by simple system prompts) and persistent, as the initial emotional tone remains detectable for hundreds of subsequent tokens. We contribute our dataset, an open-source probing toolkit, and a detailed map of the emotional landscape within LLMs, offering crucial insights for developing more transparent and aligned AI systems. The code and dataset are open-sourced.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents increasingly rely on tool use to complete real-world tasks. While existing works evaluate the LLMs' tool use capability, they largely focus on the final answers yet overlook the detailed tool usage trajectory, i.e., whether tools are selected, parameterized, and ordered correctly. We introduce TRAJECT-Bench, a trajectory-aware benchmark to comprehensively evaluate LLMs' tool use capability through diverse tasks with fine-grained evaluation metrics. TRAJECT-Bench pairs high-fidelity, executable tools across practical domains with tasks grounded in production-style APIs, and synthesizes trajectories that vary in breadth (parallel calls) and depth (interdependent chains). Besides final accuracy, TRAJECT-Bench also reports trajectory-level diagnostics, including tool selection and argument correctness, and dependency/order satisfaction. Analyses reveal failure modes such as similar tool confusion and parameter-blind selection, and scaling behavior with tool diversity and trajectory length where the bottleneck of transiting from short to mid-length trajectories is revealed, offering actionable guidance for LLMs' tool use.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning is a primary indicator of large language models (LLMs) intelligence. However, existing LLMs exhibit failures of robustness and generalization. This paper attributes these deficiencies to spurious reasoning, i.e., producing answers from superficial features. To address this challenge, we propose the AdaR framework to enable adaptive reasoning, wherein models rely on problem-solving logic to produce answers. AdaR synthesizes logically equivalent queries by varying variable values, and trains models with RLVR on these data to penalize spurious logic while encouraging adaptive logic. To improve data quality, we extract the problem-solving logic from the original query and generate the corresponding answer by code execution, then apply a sanity check. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaR improves robustness and generalization, achieving substantial improvement in mathematical reasoning while maintaining high data efficiency. Analysis indicates that data synthesis and RLVR function in a coordinated manner to enable adaptive reasoning in LLMs. Subsequent analyses derive key design insights into the effect of critical factors and the applicability to instruct LLMs. Our project is available at https://github.com/NJUNLP/AdaR.

This work provides a comprehensive overview of physical AI, establishing clear distinctions between theoretical physics reasoning and applied physical understanding while systematically examining how physics-grounded methods enhance AI's real-world comprehension across structured symbolic reasoning, embodied systems, and generative models. Through rigorous analysis of recent advances, we advocate for intelligent systems that ground learning in both physical principles and embodied reasoning processes, transcending pattern recognition toward genuine understanding of physical laws.

Abstract: There is a growing interest in Universal Multimodal Embeddings (UME), where models are required to generate task-specific representations. While recent studies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) perform well on such tasks, they treat MLLMs solely as encoders, overlooking their generative capacity. However, such an encoding paradigm becomes less effective as instructions become more complex and require compositional reasoning. Inspired by the proven effectiveness of chain-of-thought reasoning, we propose a general Think-Then-Embed (TTE) framework for UME, composed of a reasoner and an embedder. The reasoner MLLM first generates reasoning traces that explain complex queries, followed by an embedder that produces representations conditioned on both the original query and the intermediate reasoning. This explicit reasoning step enables more nuanced understanding of complex multimodal instructions. Our contributions are threefold. First, by leveraging a powerful MLLM reasoner, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the MMEB-V2 benchmark, surpassing proprietary models trained on massive in-house datasets. Second, to reduce the dependency on large MLLM reasoners, we finetune a smaller MLLM reasoner using high-quality embedding-centric reasoning traces, achieving the best performance among open-source models with a 7% absolute gain over recently proposed models. Third, we investigate strategies for integrating the reasoner and embedder into a unified model for improved efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: The vector autoregressive (VAR) model has been used to describe the dependence within and across multiple time series. This is a model for stationary time series which can be extended to allow the presence of a deterministic trend in each series. Detrending the data either parametrically or nonparametrically before fitting the VAR model gives rise to more errors in the latter part. In this study, we propose a new approach called DeepVARwT that employs deep learning methodology for maximum likelihood estimation of the trend and the dependence structure at the same time. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is used for this purpose. To ensure the stability of the model, we enforce the causality condition on the autoregressive coefficients using the transformation of Ansley & Kohn (1986). We provide a simulation study and an application to real data. In the simulation study, we use realistic trend functions generated from real data and compare the estimates with true function/parameter values. In the real data application, we compare the prediction performance of this model with state-of-the-art models in the literature.

Abstract: Loss function learning is a new meta-learning paradigm that aims to automate the essential task of designing a loss function for a machine learning model. Existing techniques for loss function learning have shown promising results, often improving a model's training dynamics and final inference performance. However, a significant limitation of these techniques is that the loss functions are meta-learned in an offline fashion, where the meta-objective only considers the very first few steps of training, which is a significantly shorter time horizon than the one typically used for training deep neural networks. This causes significant bias towards loss functions that perform well at the very start of training but perform poorly at the end of training. To address this issue we propose a new loss function learning technique for adaptively updating the loss function online after each update to the base model parameters. The experimental results show that our proposed method consistently outperforms the cross-entropy loss and offline loss function learning techniques on a diverse range of neural network architectures and datasets.

Abstract: Distantly-Supervised Named Entity Recognition effectively alleviates the burden of time-consuming and expensive annotation in the supervised setting. But the context-free matching process and the limited coverage of knowledge bases introduce inaccurate and incomplete annotation noise respectively. Previous studies either considered only incomplete annotation noise or indiscriminately handle two types of noise with the same strategy. In this paper, we argue that the different causes of two types of noise bring up the requirement of different strategies in model architecture. Therefore, we propose the SANTA to handle these two types of noise separately with (1) Memory-smoothed Focal Loss and Entity-aware KNN to relieve the entity ambiguity problem caused by inaccurate annotation, and (2) Boundary Mixup to alleviate decision boundary shifting problem caused by incomplete annotation and a noise-tolerant loss to improve the robustness. Benefiting from our separate tailored strategies, we confirm in the experiment that the two types of noise are well mitigated. SANTA also achieves a new state-of-the-art on five public datasets.

Abstract: Camouflaged objects that blend into natural scenes pose significant challenges for deep-learning models to detect and synthesize. While camouflaged object detection is a crucial task in computer vision with diverse real-world applications, this research topic has been constrained by limited data availability. We propose a framework for synthesizing camouflage data to enhance the detection of camouflaged objects in natural scenes. Our approach employs a generative model to produce realistic camouflage images, which can be used to train existing object detection models. Specifically, we use a camouflage environment generator supervised by a camouflage distribution classifier to synthesize the camouflage images, which are then fed into our generator to expand the dataset. Our framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art method on three datasets (COD10k, CAMO, and CHAMELEON), demonstrating its effectiveness in improving camouflaged object detection. This approach can serve as a plug-and-play data generation and augmentation module for existing camouflaged object detection tasks and provides a novel way to introduce more diversity and distributions into current camouflage datasets.

Abstract: The increasing scale of data propels the popularity of leveraging parallelism to speed up the optimization. Minibatch stochastic gradient descent (minibatch SGD) and local SGD are two popular methods for parallel optimization. The existing theoretical studies show a linear speedup of these methods with respect to the number of machines, which, however, is measured by optimization errors in a multi-pass setting. As a comparison, the stability and generalization of these methods are much less studied. In this paper, we study the stability and generalization analysis of minibatch and local SGD to understand their learnability by introducing an expectation-variance decomposition. We incorporate training errors into the stability analysis, which shows how small training errors help generalization for overparameterized models. We show minibatch and local SGD achieve a linear speedup to attain the optimal risk bounds.

Abstract: Most problems within and beyond the scientific domain can be framed into one of the following three levels of complexity of function approximation. Type 1: Approximate an unknown function given input/output data. Type 2: Consider a collection of variables and functions, some of which are unknown, indexed by the nodes and hyperedges of a hypergraph (a generalized graph where edges can connect more than two vertices). Given partial observations of the variables of the hypergraph (satisfying the functional dependencies imposed by its structure), approximate all the unobserved variables and unknown functions. Type 3: Expanding on Type 2, if the hypergraph structure itself is unknown, use partial observations of the variables of the hypergraph to discover its structure and approximate its unknown functions. These hypergraphs offer a natural platform for organizing, communicating, and processing computational knowledge. While most scientific problems can be framed as the data-driven discovery of unknown functions in a computational hypergraph whose structure is known (Type 2), many require the data-driven discovery of the structure (connectivity) of the hypergraph itself (Type 3). We introduce an interpretable Gaussian Process (GP) framework for such (Type 3) problems that does not require randomization of the data, access to or control over its sampling, or sparsity of the unknown functions in a known or learned basis. Its polynomial complexity, which contrasts sharply with the super-exponential complexity of causal inference methods, is enabled by the nonlinear ANOVA capabilities of GPs used as a sensing mechanism.

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) aims to analyze text or speech via techniques in the computer science field. It serves applications in the domains of healthcare, commerce, education, and so on. Particularly, NLP has been widely applied to the education domain and its applications have enormous potential to help teaching and learning. In this survey, we review recent advances in NLP with a focus on solving problems relevant to the education domain. In detail, we begin with introducing the related background and the real-world scenarios in education to which NLP techniques could contribute. Then, we present a taxonomy of NLP in the education domain and highlight typical NLP applications including question answering, question construction, automated assessment, and error correction. Next, we illustrate the task definition, challenges, and corresponding cutting-edge techniques based on the above taxonomy. In particular, LLM-involved methods are included for discussion due to the wide usage of LLMs in diverse NLP applications. After that, we showcase some off-the-shelf demonstrations in this domain, which are designed for educators or researchers. At last, we conclude with five promising directions for future research, including generalization over subjects and languages, deployed LLM-based systems for education, adaptive learning for teaching and learning, interpretability for education, and ethical consideration of NLP techniques. We organize all relevant datasets and papers in the open-available Github Link for better review https://github.com/LiXinyuan1015/NLP-for-Education.

<title>Discovering and Reasoning of Causality in the Hidden World with Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Revealing hidden causal variables alongside the underlying causal mechanisms is essential to the development of science. Despite the progress in the past decades, existing practice in causal discovery (CD) heavily relies on high-quality measured variables, which are usually given by human experts. In fact, the lack of well-defined high-level variables behind unstructured data has been a longstanding roadblock to a broader real-world application of CD. This procedure can naturally benefit from an automated process that can suggest potential hidden variables in the system. Interestingly, Large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive observations of the world and have demonstrated great capability in processing unstructured data. To leverage the power of LLMs, we develop a new framework termed Causal representatiOn AssistanT (COAT) that incorporates the rich world knowledge of LLMs to propose useful measured variables for CD with respect to high-value target variables on their paired unstructured data. Instead of directly inferring causality with LLMs, COAT constructs feedback from intermediate CD results to LLMs to refine the proposed variables. Given the target variable and the paired unstructured data, we first develop COAT-MB that leverages the predictivity of the proposed variables to iteratively uncover the Markov Blanket of the target variable. Built upon COAT-MB, COAT-PAG further extends to uncover a more complete causal graph, i.e., Partial Ancestral Graph, by iterating over the target variables and actively seeking new high-level variables. Moreover, the reliable CD capabilities of COAT also extend the debiased causal inference to unstructured data by discovering an adjustment set. We establish theoretical guarantees for the CD results and verify their efficiency and reliability across realistic benchmarks and real-world case studies.

<title>Output Format Biases in the Evaluation of Large Language Models for Code Translation</title>

Abstract: Code translation between programming languages (PLs) is a critical task in software engineering, facilitating the modernization of legacy systems, ensuring cross-platform compatibility, and enhancing software performance. Most existing studies instruct LLMs to perform code translation and evaluate their performance by either running the generated outputs through test suites or comparing them to reference outputs (ground truth). These outputs, however, may contain not only executable source code but also additional non-code elements, such as natural language explanations or formatting tokens. We refer to the combination of source code and non-code elements as the output format. It is crucial to understand and address variations in output format, as non-code elements can interfere with evaluation metrics, resulting in biased assessments of model performance and comparisons. We conduct an empirical analysis of the outputs from eleven instruct-tuned open-source LLMs, across five PLs: C, C++, Go, Java, and Python. The results show that between 26.4% and 73.7% of outputs produced by our evaluated LLMs necessitate post-processing. To mitigate output format bias, we propose a strategic combination of prompt engineering and regular expressions that effectively extracts source code from mixed-format outputs, enabling the eleven open-source models to achieve an average Code Extraction Success Rate (CSR) of 92.73%. Our empirical study confirms that output format bias affects widely used execution-based metrics, i.e., Computational Accuracy (CA), and text-based metrics, i.e., BLEU, CodeBLEU and CrystalBLEU. Additionally, we test five closed-source LLMs and observe that they also generate varying distributions of output formats, which could lead to output format biases. Our results highlight the need to mitigate the output format bias to enable reliable evaluations in LLMs for code translation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to significantly contribute to patient care, diagnostics, and administrative processes. Emerging biomedical LLMs aim to address healthcare-specific challenges, including privacy demands and computational constraints. Assessing the models' suitability for this sensitive application area is of the utmost importance. However, biomedical training has not been systematically evaluated on medical tasks. This study investigates the effect of biomedical training in the context of six practical medical tasks evaluating $25$ models. In contrast to previous evaluations, our results reveal a performance decline in nine out of twelve biomedical models after fine-tuning, particularly on tasks involving hallucinations, ICD10 coding, and instruction adherence. General-domain models like Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct outperformed their biomedical counterparts, indicating a trade-off between domain-specific fine-tuning and general medical task performance. We open-source all evaluation scripts and datasets at https://github.com/TIO-IKIM/CLUE to support further research in this critical area.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the predominant approach for learning over graph-structured data. However, most GNNs operate as black-box models and require post-hoc explanations, which may not suffice in high-stakes scenarios where transparency is crucial. In this paper, we present a GNN that is interpretable by design. Our model, Graph Neural Additive Network (GNAN), is a novel extension of the interpretable class of Generalized Additive Models, and can be visualized and fully understood by humans. GNAN is designed to be fully interpretable, offering both global and local explanations at the feature and graph levels through direct visualization of the model. These visualizations describe exactly how the model uses the relationships between the target variable, the features, and the graph. We demonstrate the intelligibility of GNANs in a series of examples on different tasks and datasets. In addition, we show that the accuracy of GNAN is on par with black-box GNNs, making it suitable for critical applications where transparency is essential, alongside high accuracy.

Abstract: This work presents an analytical framework for the design and analysis of LLM-based algorithms, i.e., algorithms that contain one or multiple calls of large language models (LLMs) as sub-routines and critically rely on the capabilities of LLMs. While such algorithms, ranging from basic LLM calls with prompt engineering to complicated LLM-powered agentic workflows and compound AI systems, have achieved remarkable empirical success, their design and optimization oftentimes require extensive trial-and-errors and case-by-case analysis. Our proposed framework serves as an attempt to mitigate such headaches, offering a formal and systematic approach for analyzing how the accuracy and efficiency of an LLM-based algorithm will be impacted by critical design choices, such as the pattern and granularity of task decomposition, or the prompt for each LLM call. Through a wide range of case studies covering diverse algorithm patterns (including parallel/hierarchical/recursive task decomposition and generic directed acyclic graphs), we demonstrate the proposed framework in action and derive interesting insights that generalize across scenarios, accompanied by systematic empirical validation in synthetic settings.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) have been widely used in recommender systems to incorporate textual information of items into item IDs, leveraging their advanced language understanding and generation capabilities. Recently, generative recommender systems have utilized the reasoning abilities of LMs to directly generate index tokens for potential items of interest based on the user's interaction history. To inject diverse item knowledge into LMs, prompt templates with detailed task descriptions and various indexing techniques derived from diverse item information have been explored. This paper focuses on the inconsistency in outputs generated by variations in input prompt templates and item index types, even with the same user's interaction history. Our in-depth quantitative analysis reveals that preference knowledge learned from diverse prompt templates and heterogeneous indices differs significantly, indicating a high potential for complementarity. To fully exploit this complementarity and provide consistent performance under varying prompts and item indices, we propose MVIGER, a unified variational framework that models selection among these information sources as a categorical latent variable with a learnable prior. During inference, this prior enables the model to adaptively select the most relevant source or aggregate predictions across multiple sources, thereby ensuring high-quality recommendation across diverse template-index combinations. We validate the effectiveness of MVIGER on three real-world datasets, demonstrating its superior performance over existing generative recommender baselines through the effective integration of complementary knowledge.

Abstract: With sepsis remaining a leading cause of mortality, early identification of patients with sepsis and those at high risk of death is a challenge of high socioeconomic importance. Given the potential of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) to monitor microcirculatory alterations, we propose a deep learning approach to automated sepsis diagnosis and mortality prediction using a single HSI cube acquired within seconds. In a prospective observational study, we collected HSI data from the palms and fingers of more than 480 intensive care unit patients. Neural networks applied to HSI measurements predicted sepsis and mortality with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCs) of 0.80 and 0.72, respectively. Performance improved substantially with additional clinical data, reaching AUROCs of 0.94 for sepsis and 0.83 for mortality. We conclude that deep learning-based HSI analysis enables rapid and noninvasive prediction of sepsis and mortality, with a potential clinical value for enhancing diagnosis and treatment.

Abstract: Generative LLM have achieved remarkable success in various industrial applications, owing to their promising In-Context Learning capabilities. However, the issue of long context in complex tasks poses a significant barrier to their wider adoption, manifested in two main aspects: (i) The excessively long context leads to high costs and inference delays. (ii) A substantial amount of task-irrelevant information introduced by long contexts exacerbates the "lost in the middle" problem. Existing methods compress context by removing redundant tokens using metrics such as self-information or PPL, which is inconsistent with the objective of retaining the most important tokens when conditioning on a given query. In this study, we introduce information bottleneck theory (IB) to model the problem, offering a novel perspective that thoroughly addresses the essential properties required for context compression. Additionally, we propose a cross-attention-based approach to approximate mutual information in IB, which can be flexibly replaced with suitable alternatives in different scenarios. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that our method achieves a 25% increase in compression rate compared to the state-of-the-art, while maintaining question answering performance. In particular, the context compressed by our method even outperform the full context in some cases.

Abstract: Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans are frequently performed in clinical settings. Opportunistic CT involves repurposing routine CT images to extract diagnostic information and is an emerging tool for detecting underdiagnosed conditions such as sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites. This study utilizes deep learning methods to promote accurate diagnosis and clinical documentation. We analyze 2,674 inpatient CT scans to identify discrepancies between imaging phenotypes (characteristics derived from opportunistic CT scans) and their corresponding documentation in radiology reports and ICD coding. Through our analysis, we find that only 0.5%, 3.2%, and 30.7% of scans diagnosed with sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites (respectively) through either opportunistic imaging or radiology reports were ICD-coded. Our findings demonstrate opportunistic CT's potential to enhance diagnostic precision and accuracy of risk adjustment models, offering advancements in precision medicine.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains, yet deploying them on mobile devices remains an arduous challenge due to their extensive computational and memory demands. While lightweight LLMs have been developed to fit mobile environments, they suffer from degraded model accuracy. In contrast, sparsity-based techniques minimize DRAM usage by selectively transferring only relevant neurons to DRAM while retaining the full model in external storage, such as flash. However, such approaches are critically limited by numerous I/O operations, particularly on smartphones with severe IOPS constraints.
  In this paper, we propose Neuralink, a novel approach that accelerates LLM inference on smartphones by optimizing neuron placement in flash memory. Neuralink leverages the concept of Neuron Co-Activation, where neurons frequently activated together are linked to facilitate continuous read access and optimize I/O efficiency. Our approach incorporates a two-stage solution: an offline stage that reorganizes neuron placement based on co-activation patterns, and an online stage that employs tailored data access and caching strategies to align well with hardware characteristics. Evaluations conducted on a variety of smartphones and LLMs demonstrate that Neuralink achieves on average $1.49\times$ improvements in end-to-end latency compared to the state-of-the-art. As the first solution to optimize storage placement under sparsity, Neuralink explores a new optimization space at the intersection of sparsity-driven algorithm and storage-level system co-design for LLM inference.

Abstract: Embedding-based retrieval aims to learn a shared semantic representation space for both queries and items, enabling efficient and effective item retrieval through approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithms. In current industrial practice, retrieval systems typically retrieve a fixed number of items for each query. However, this fixed-size retrieval often results in insufficient recall for head queries and low precision for tail queries. This limitation largely stems from the dominance of frequentist approaches in loss function design, which fail to address this challenge in industry. In this paper, we propose a novel \textbf{p}robabilistic \textbf{E}mbedding-\textbf{B}ased \textbf{R}etrieval (\textbf{pEBR}) framework. Our method models the item distribution conditioned on each query, enabling the use of a dynamic cosine similarity threshold derived from the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the probabilistic model. Experimental results demonstrate that pEBR significantly improves both retrieval precision and recall. Furthermore, ablation studies reveal that the probabilistic formulation effectively captures the inherent differences between head-to-tail queries.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a lucrative promise for scalable content moderation, including hate speech detection. However, they are also known to be brittle and biased against marginalised communities and dialects. This requires their applications to high-stakes tasks like hate speech detection to be critically scrutinized. In this work, we investigate the robustness of hate speech classification using LLMs particularly when explicit and implicit markers of the speaker's ethnicity are injected into the input. For explicit markers, we inject a phrase that mentions the speaker's linguistic identity. For the implicit markers, we inject dialectal features. By analysing how frequently model outputs flip in the presence of these markers, we reveal varying degrees of brittleness across 3 LLMs and 1 LM and 5 linguistic identities. We find that the presence of implicit dialect markers in inputs causes model outputs to flip more than the presence of explicit markers. Further, the percentage of flips varies across ethnicities. Finally, we find that larger models are more robust. Our findings indicate the need for exercising caution in deploying LLMs for high-stakes tasks like hate speech detection.

Abstract: While inorganic retrosynthesis planning is essential in the field of chemical science, the application of machine learning in this area has been notably less explored compared to organic retrosynthesis planning. In this paper, we propose Retrieval-Retro for inorganic retrosynthesis planning, which implicitly extracts the precursor information of reference materials that are retrieved from the knowledge base regarding domain expertise in the field. Specifically, instead of directly employing the precursor information of reference materials, we propose implicitly extracting it with various attention layers, which enables the model to learn novel synthesis recipes more effectively. Moreover, during retrieval, we consider the thermodynamic relationship between target material and precursors, which is essential domain expertise in identifying the most probable precursor set among various options. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Retrieval-Retro in retrosynthesis planning, especially in discovering novel synthesis recipes, which is crucial for materials discovery.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to support various decision-making tasks, assisting humans in making informed decisions. However, when LLMs confidently provide incorrect information, it can lead humans to make suboptimal decisions. To prevent LLMs from generating incorrect information on topics they are unsure of and to improve the accuracy of generated content, prior works have proposed Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), where external documents are referenced to generate responses. However, previous RAG methods focus only on retrieving documents most relevant to the input query, without specifically aiming to ensure that the human user's decisions are well-calibrated. To address this limitation, we propose a novel retrieval method called Calibrated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (CalibRAG), which ensures that decisions informed by RAG are well-calibrated. Then we empirically validate that CalibRAG improves calibration performance as well as accuracy, compared to other baselines across various datasets.

Abstract: Condensing large datasets into smaller synthetic counterparts has demonstrated its promise for image classification. However, previous research has overlooked a crucial concern in image recognition: ensuring that models trained on condensed datasets are unbiased towards protected attributes (PA), such as gender and race. Our investigation reveals that dataset distillation fails to alleviate the unfairness towards minority groups within original datasets. Moreover, this bias typically worsens in the condensed datasets due to their smaller size. To bridge the research gap, we propose a novel fair dataset distillation (FDD) framework, namely FairDD, which can be seamlessly applied to diverse matching-based DD approaches (DDs), requiring no modifications to their original architectures. The key innovation of FairDD lies in synchronously matching synthetic datasets to PA-wise groups of original datasets, rather than indiscriminate alignment to the whole distributions in vanilla DDs, dominated by majority groups. This synchronized matching allows synthetic datasets to avoid collapsing into majority groups and bootstrap their balanced generation to all PA groups. Consequently, FairDD could effectively regularize vanilla DDs to favor biased generation toward minority groups while maintaining the accuracy of target attributes. Theoretical analyses and extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that FairDD significantly improves fairness compared to vanilla DDs, with a promising trade-off between fairness and accuracy. Its consistent superiority across diverse DDs, spanning Distribution and Gradient Matching, establishes it as a versatile FDD approach. Code is available at https://github.com/zqhang/FairDD.

Abstract: Scaling robot learning requires data collection pipelines that scale favorably with human effort. In this work, we propose Crowdsourcing and Amortizing Human Effort for Real-to-Sim-to-Real(CASHER), a pipeline for scaling up data collection and learning in simulation where the performance scales superlinearly with human effort. The key idea is to crowdsource digital twins of real-world scenes using 3D reconstruction and collect large-scale data in simulation, rather than the real-world. Data collection in simulation is initially driven by RL, bootstrapped with human demonstrations. As the training of a generalist policy progresses across environments, its generalization capabilities can be used to replace human effort with model generated demonstrations. This results in a pipeline where behavioral data is collected in simulation with continually reducing human effort. We show that CASHER demonstrates zero-shot and few-shot scaling laws on three real-world tasks across diverse scenarios. We show that CASHER enables fine-tuning of pre-trained policies to a target scenario using a video scan without any additional human effort.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning is gaining increasing attention thanks to its capability to learn complex policies in high-dimensional settings. Recent advancements utilize a dual-network architecture to learn optimal policies through the Q-learning algorithm. However, this approach has notable drawbacks, such as an overestimation bias that can disrupt the learning process and degrade the performance of the resulting policy. To address this, novel algorithms have been developed that mitigate overestimation bias by employing multiple Q-functions. Edge scenarios, which prioritize privacy, have recently gained prominence. In these settings, limited computational resources pose a significant challenge for complex Machine Learning approaches, making the efficiency of algorithms crucial for their performance. In this work, we introduce a novel Reinforcement Learning algorithm tailored for edge scenarios, called Edge Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (EdgeD3). EdgeD3 enhances the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm, achieving significantly improved performance with $25\%$ less Graphics Process Unit (GPU) time while maintaining the same memory usage. Additionally, EdgeD3 consistently matches or surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks, all while using $30\%$ fewer computational resources and requiring $30\%$ less memory.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has the potential of lifting several of the key challenges in reinforcement learning today, such as exploration, representation learning, and reward design. Recent work (METRA) has effectively argued that moving away from mutual information and instead optimizing a certain Wasserstein distance is important for good performance. In this paper, we argue that the benefits seen in that paper can largely be explained within the existing framework of mutual information skill learning (MISL). Our analysis suggests a new MISL method (contrastive successor features) that retains the excellent performance of METRA with fewer moving parts, and highlights connections between skill learning, contrastive representation learning, and successor features. Finally, through careful ablation studies, we provide further insight into some of the key ingredients for both our method and METRA.

Abstract: Keyword extraction involves identifying the most descriptive words in a document, allowing automatic categorisation and summarisation of large quantities of diverse textual data. Relying on the insight that real-world keyword detection often requires handling of diverse content, we propose a novel supervised keyword extraction approach based on the mixture of experts (MoE) technique. MoE uses a learnable routing sub-network to direct information to specialised experts, allowing them to specialise in distinct regions of the input space. SEKE, a mixture of Specialised Experts for supervised Keyword Extraction, uses DeBERTa as the backbone model and builds on the MoE framework, where experts attend to each token, by integrating it with a bidirectional Long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network, to allow successful extraction even on smaller corpora, where specialisation is harder due to lack of training data. The MoE framework also provides an insight into inner workings of individual experts, enhancing the explainability of the approach. We benchmark SEKE on multiple English datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to strong supervised and unsupervised baselines. Our analysis reveals that depending on data size and type, experts specialise in distinct syntactic and semantic components, such as punctuation, stopwords, parts-of-speech, or named entities.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the mainstream approach for visual generation. However, these models typically suffer from sample inefficiency and high training costs. Consequently, methods for efficient finetuning, inference and personalization were quickly adopted by the community. However, training these models in the first place remains very costly. While several recent approaches - including masking, distillation, and architectural modifications - have been proposed to improve training efficiency, each of these methods comes with a tradeoff: they achieve enhanced performance at the expense of increased computational cost or vice versa. In contrast, this work aims to improve training efficiency as well as generative performance at the same time through routes that act as a transport mechanism for randomly selected tokens from early layers to deeper layers of the model. Our method is not limited to the common transformer-based model - it can also be applied to state-space models and achieves this without architectural modifications or additional parameters. Finally, we show that TREAD reduces computational cost and simultaneously boosts model performance on the standard ImageNet-256 benchmark in class-conditional synthesis. Both of these benefits multiply to a convergence speedup of 14x at 400K training iterations compared to DiT and 37x compared to the best benchmark performance of DiT at 7M training iterations. Furthermore, we achieve a competitive FID of 2.09 in a guided and 3.93 in an unguided setting, which improves upon the DiT, without architectural changes.

Abstract: Teaching robots to autonomously complete everyday tasks remains a challenge. Imitation Learning (IL) is a powerful approach that imbues robots with skills via demonstrations, but is limited by the labor-intensive process of collecting teleoperated robot data. Human videos offer a scalable alternative, but it remains difficult to directly train IL policies from them due to the lack of robot action labels. To address this, we propose to represent actions as short-horizon 2D trajectories on an image. These actions, or motion tracks, capture the predicted direction of motion for either human hands or robot end-effectors. We instantiate an IL policy called Motion Track Policy (MT-pi) which receives image observations and outputs motion tracks as actions. By leveraging this unified, cross-embodiment action space, MT-pi completes tasks with high success given just minutes of human video and limited additional robot demonstrations. At test time, we predict motion tracks from two camera views, recovering 6DoF trajectories via multi-view synthesis. MT-pi achieves an average success rate of 86.5% across 4 real-world tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art IL baselines which do not leverage human data or our action space by 40%, and generalizes to scenarios seen only in human videos. Code and videos are available on our website https://portal-cornell.github.io/motion_track_policy/.

<title>On the Role of Transformer Feed-Forward Layers in Nonlinear In-Context Learning</title>

Abstract: Transformer-based models demonstrate a remarkable ability for in-context learning (ICL), where they can adapt to unseen tasks from a few prompt examples without parameter updates. Recent research has illuminated how Transformers perform ICL, showing that the optimal linear self-attention (LSA) mechanism can implement one step of gradient descent for linear least-squares objectives when trained on random linear regression tasks. Building on this, we investigate ICL for nonlinear function classes. We first prove that LSA is inherently incapable of outperforming linear predictors on nonlinear tasks, underscoring why prior solutions cannot readily extend to these problems. To overcome this limitation, we analyze a Transformer block consisting of LSA and feed-forward layers inspired by the gated linear units (GLU), which is a standard component of modern Transformers. We show that this block achieves nonlinear ICL by implementing one step of gradient descent on a polynomial kernel regression loss. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the expressivity of a single block is inherently limited by its dimensions. We then show that a deep Transformer can overcome this bottleneck by distributing the computation of richer kernel functions across multiple blocks, performing block-coordinate descent in a high-dimensional feature space that a single block cannot represent. Our findings highlight that the feed-forward layers provide a crucial and scalable mechanism by which Transformers can express nonlinear representations for ICL.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) optimize federated training by reducing computational and communication costs. We propose RoLoRA, a federated framework using alternating optimization to fine-tune LoRA adapters. Our approach emphasizes the importance of learning up and down projection matrices to enhance expressiveness and robustness. We use both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to demonstrate the advantages of RoLoRA over prior approaches that either generate imperfect model updates or limit expressiveness of the model. We provide a theoretical analysis on a linear model to highlight the importance of learning both the down-projection and up-projection matrices in LoRA. We validate the insights on a non-linear model and separately provide a convergence proof under general conditions. To bridge theory and practice, we conducted extensive experimental evaluations on language models including RoBERTa-Large, Llama-2-7B on diverse tasks and FL settings to demonstrate the advantages of RoLoRA over other methods.

Abstract: The GPT-4 technical report suggests that downstream performance can be predicted from pre-training signals, but offers little methodological detail on how to quantify this. This work address this gap by modeling knowledge retention, the capacity of a pre-trained language model to memorize factual information from its corpus, and introduce a principled method to estimate it prior to training. We propose Size-dependent Mutual Information (SMI), an information-theoretic predictor that integrates knowledge frequency, knowledge specificity, and model size to forecast closed-book question answering (QA) accuracy. SMI is validated through large-scale document retrieval over the disclosed pre-training corpora of 21 public and 3 custom models, combined with a robust multi-template QA evaluation. Experiments show that SMI significantly outperforms repetition-based baselines and achieves $R^2$ > 0.7 in predicting QA accuracy for models above 1B parameters, without additional training. The analysis further reveals diminishing returns from scaling data and model size and provides evidence for an intrinsic upper bound on knowledge retention achievable by pre-training alone, motivating retrieval and other augmentation strategies.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation enhances the performance of compact student networks by transferring knowledge from more powerful teacher networks without introducing additional parameters. In the feature space, local regions within an individual global feature encode distinct yet interdependent semantic information. Previous feature-based distillation methods mainly emphasize global feature alignment while neglecting the decoupling of local regions within an individual global feature, which often results in semantic confusion and suboptimal performance. Moreover, conventional contrastive representation distillation suffers from low efficiency due to its reliance on a large memory buffer to store feature samples. To address these limitations, this work proposes MSDCRD, a model-agnostic distillation framework that systematically decouples global features into multi-scale local features and leverages the resulting semantically rich feature samples with tailored sample-wise and feature-wise contrastive losses. This design enables efficient distillation using only a single batch, eliminating the dependence on external memory. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MSDCRD achieves superior performance not only in homogeneous teacher-student settings but also in heterogeneous architectures where feature discrepancies are more pronounced, highlighting its strong generalization capability.

Abstract: Causal knowledge can be used to support decision-making problems. This has been recognized in the causal bandits literature, where a causal (multi-armed) bandit is characterized by a causal graphical model and a target variable. The arms are then interventions on the causal model, and rewards are samples of the target variable. Causal bandits were originally studied with a focus on hard interventions. We focus instead on cases where the arms are conditional interventions, which more accurately model many real-world decision-making problems by allowing the value of the intervened variable to be chosen based on the observed values of other variables. This paper presents a graphical characterization of the minimal set of nodes guaranteed to contain the optimal conditional intervention, which maximizes the expected reward. We then propose an efficient algorithm with a time complexity of $O(|V| + |E|)$ to identify this minimal set of nodes. We prove that the graphical characterization and the proposed algorithm are correct. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that our algorithm significantly prunes the search space and substantially accelerates convergence rates when integrated into standard multi-armed bandit algorithms.

Abstract: We investigate a Bayesian mechanism design problem where a seller seeks to maximize revenue by selling an indivisible good to one of n buyers, incorporating potentially unreliable predictions (signals) of buyers' private values derived from a machine learning model. We propose a framework where these signals are sometimes reflective of buyers' true valuations but other times are hallucinations, which are uncorrelated with the buyers' true valuations. Our main contribution is a characterization of the optimal auction under this framework. Our characterization establishes a near-decomposition of how to treat types above and below the signal. For the one buyer case, the seller's optimal strategy is to post one of three fairly intuitive prices depending on the signal, which we call the "ignore", "follow" and "cap" actions.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural surrogate modeling offer the potential for transformative innovations in applications such as automotive aerodynamics. Yet, industrial-scale problems often involve volumetric meshes with cell counts reaching 100 million, presenting major scalability challenges. Complex geometries further complicate modeling through intricate surface-volume interactions, while quantities such as vorticity are highly nonlinear and must satisfy strict divergence-free constraints. To address these requirements, we introduce AB-UPT as a novel modeling scheme for building neural surrogates for CFD simulations. AB-UPT is designed to: (i) decouple geometry encoding and prediction tasks via multi-branch operators; (ii) enable scalability to high-resolution outputs via neural simulation in a low-dimensional latent space, coupled with anchored neural field decoders to predict high-fidelity outputs; (iii) enforce physics consistency by a divergence-free formulation. We show that AB-UPT yields state-of-the-art predictive accuracy of surface and volume fields on automotive CFD simulations ranging from 33 thousand up to 150 million mesh cells. Furthermore, our anchored neural field architecture enables the enforcement of hard physical constraints on the physics predictions without degradation in performance, exemplified by modeling divergence-free vorticity fields. Notably, the proposed models can be trained on a single GPU in less than a day and predict industry-standard surface and volume fields within seconds. Additionally, we show that the flexible design of our method enables neural simulation from a CAD geometry alone, thereby eliminating the need for costly CFD meshing procedures for inference.

Abstract: As LLM-based agents become increasingly prevalent, backdoors can be implanted into agents through user queries or environment feedback, raising critical concerns regarding safety vulnerabilities. However, backdoor attacks are typically detectable by safety audits that analyze the reasoning process of agents. To this end, we propose a novel backdoor implantation strategy called \textbf{Dynamically Encrypted Multi-Backdoor Implantation Attack}. Specifically, we introduce dynamic encryption, which maps the backdoor into benign content, effectively circumventing safety audits. To enhance stealthiness, we further decompose the backdoor into multiple sub-backdoor fragments. Based on these advancements, backdoors are allowed to bypass safety audits significantly. Additionally, we present AgentBackdoorEval, a dataset designed for the comprehensive evaluation of agent backdoor attacks. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an attack success rate nearing 100\% while maintaining a detection rate of 0\%, illustrating its effectiveness in evading safety audits. Our findings highlight the limitations of existing safety mechanisms in detecting advanced attacks, underscoring the urgent need for more robust defenses against backdoor threats.

Abstract: Many everyday mobile manipulation tasks require precise interaction with small objects, such as grasping a knob to open a cabinet or pressing a light switch. In this paper, we develop Servoing with Vision Models (SVM), a closed-loop framework that enables a mobile manipulator to tackle such precise tasks involving the manipulation of small objects. SVM uses state-of-the-art vision foundation models to generate 3D targets for visual servoing to enable diverse tasks in novel environments. Naively doing so fails because of occlusion by the end-effector. SVM mitigates this using vision models that out-paint the end-effector, thereby significantly enhancing target localization. We demonstrate that aided by out-painting methods, open-vocabulary object detectors can serve as a drop-in module for SVM to seek semantic targets (e.g. knobs) and point tracking methods can help SVM reliably pursue interaction sites indicated by user clicks. We conduct a large-scale evaluation spanning experiments in 10 novel environments across 6 buildings including 72 different object instances. SVM obtains a 71% zero-shot success rate on manipulating unseen objects in novel environments in the real world, outperforming an open-loop control method by an absolute 42% and an imitation learning baseline trained on 1000+ demonstrations also by an absolute success rate of 50%.

Abstract: Recent advances in automated theorem proving use Large Language Models (LLMs) to translate informal mathematical statements into formal proofs. However, informal cues are often ambiguous or lack strict logical structure, making it hard for models to interpret them precisely. While existing methods achieve strong performance, little is known about how LLMs internally represent informal cues, or how these influence proof generation. To address this, we explore \textit{activation steering}, an inference-time intervention that identifies linear directions in residual activations associated with informal reasoning traces and adjusts them to improve proof construction without fine-tuning. This mechanism also yields interpretable information about how reasoning is internally encoded in the activation space of LLMs. We test our method for generating formal proofs from already-formalized theorems. Our contributions are twofold: (1) a novel activation-based intervention for guiding proof synthesis in LLMs; and (2) demonstration that this intervention improves performance under two decoding strategies (sampling and best-first search) without any further training.

Abstract: The escalating scale and cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) training necessitate accurate pre-training prediction of downstream task performance for efficient resource allocation. This is challenged by: 1) the emergence phenomenon, where metrics become meaningful only after extensive training, hindering prediction by smaller models; and 2) uneven task difficulty and inconsistent performance scaling patterns, leading to high metric variability. Current prediction methods lack accuracy and reliability. We propose a Clustering-On-Difficulty (COD) framework for downstream performance prediction. The COD framework clusters tasks by their difficulty scaling features, thereby establishing a more stable and predictable support subset through the exclusion of tasks exhibiting non-emergent behavior or irregular scaling. We adopt a performance scaling law to predict cluster-wise performance with theoretical support. Predictable subset performance acts as an intermediate predictor for the full evaluation set. We further derive a mapping function to accurately extrapolate the performance of the subset to the full set. Applied to an LLM with 70B parameters, COD achieved a 1.36% average prediction error across eight key LLM benchmarks, offering actionable insights for resource allocation and training monitoring of LLMs pretraining.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that making a model spend more time thinking through longer Chain of Thoughts (CoTs) enables it to gain significant improvements in complex reasoning tasks. While current researches continue to explore the benefits of increasing test-time compute by extending the CoT lengths of Large Language Models (LLMs), we are concerned about a potential issue hidden behind the current pursuit of test-time scaling: Would excessively scaling the CoT length actually bring adverse effects to a model's reasoning performance? Our explorations on mathematical reasoning tasks reveal an unexpected finding that scaling with longer CoTs can indeed impair the reasoning performance of LLMs in certain domains. Moreover, we discover that there exists an optimal scaled length distribution that differs across different domains. Based on these insights, we propose a Thinking-Optimal Scaling strategy. Our method first uses a small set of seed data with varying response length distributions to teach the model to adopt different reasoning efforts for deep thinking. Then, the model selects its shortest correct response under different reasoning efforts on additional problems for self-improvement. Our self-improved models built upon Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct outperform other distillation-based 32B o1-like models across various math benchmarks, and achieve performance on par with the teacher model QwQ-32B-Preview that produces the seed data.

Abstract: Evaluating the pedagogical capabilities of AI-based tutoring models is critical for making guided progress in the field. Yet, we lack a reliable, easy-to-use, and simple-to-run evaluation that reflects the pedagogical abilities of models. To fill this gap, we present MathTutorBench, an open-source benchmark for holistic tutoring model evaluation. MathTutorBench contains a collection of datasets and metrics that broadly cover tutor abilities as defined by learning sciences research in dialog-based teaching. To score the pedagogical quality of open-ended teacher responses, we train a reward model and show it can discriminate expert from novice teacher responses with high accuracy. We evaluate a wide set of closed- and open-weight models on MathTutorBench and find that subject expertise, indicated by solving ability, does not immediately translate to good teaching. Rather, pedagogy and subject expertise appear to form a trade-off that is navigated by the degree of tutoring specialization of the model. Furthermore, tutoring appears to become more challenging in longer dialogs, where simpler questioning strategies begin to fail. We release the benchmark, code, and leaderboard openly to enable rapid benchmarking of future models.

<title>Disentangling Feature Structure: A Mathematically Provable Two-Stage Training Dynamics in Transformers</title>

Abstract: Transformers may exhibit two-stage training dynamics during the real-world training process. For instance, when training GPT-2 on the Counterfact dataset, the answers progress from syntactically incorrect to syntactically correct to semantically correct. However, existing theoretical analyses hardly account for this feature-level two-stage phenomenon, which originates from the disentangled two-type features like syntax and semantics. In this paper, we theoretically demonstrate how the two-stage training dynamics potentially occur in transformers. Specifically, we analyze the feature learning dynamics induced by the aforementioned disentangled two-type feature structure, grounding our analysis in a simplified yet illustrative setting that comprises a normalized ReLU self-attention layer and structured data. Such disentanglement of feature structure is general in practice, e.g., natural languages contain syntax and semantics, and proteins contain primary and secondary structures. To our best knowledge, this is the first rigorous result regarding a feature-level two-stage optimization process in transformers. Additionally, a corollary indicates that such a two-stage process is closely related to the spectral properties of the attention weights, which accords well with our empirical findings.

Abstract: Training Long-Context Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenging, as hybrid training with long-context and short-context data often leads to workload imbalances. Existing works mainly use data packing to alleviate this issue, but fail to consider imbalanced attention computation and wasted communication overhead. This paper proposes Hierarchical Balance Packing (HBP), which designs a novel batch-construction method and training recipe to address those inefficiencies. In particular, the HBP constructs multi-level data packing groups, each optimized with a distinct packing length. It assigns training samples to their optimal groups and configures each group with the most effective settings, including sequential parallelism degree and gradient checkpointing configuration. To effectively utilize multi-level groups of data, we design a dynamic training pipeline specifically tailored to HBP, including curriculum learning, adaptive sequential parallelism, and stable loss. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces training time over multiple datasets and open-source models while maintaining strong performance. For the largest DeepSeek-V2 (236B) MoE model, our method speeds up the training by 2.4$\times$ with competitive performance. Codes will be released at https://github.com/ModelTC/HBP.

Abstract: Reproducing game bugs, particularly crash bugs in continuously evolving games like Minecraft, is a notoriously manual, time-consuming, and challenging process to automate; insights from a key decision maker from Minecraft we interviewed confirm this, highlighting that a substantial portion of crash reports necessitate manual scenario reconstruction. Despite the success of LLM-driven bug reproduction in other software domains, games, with their complex interactive environments, remain largely unaddressed. This paper introduces BugCraft, a novel end-to-end framework designed to automate the reproduction of crash bugs in Minecraft directly from user-submitted bug reports, addressing the critical gap in automated game bug reproduction. BugCraft employs a two-stage approach: first, a Step Synthesizer leverages LLMs and Minecraft Wiki knowledge to transform bug reports into high-quality, structured steps to reproduce (S2R). Second, an Action Model, powered by a vision-based LLM agent and a custom macro API, executes these S2R steps within Minecraft to trigger the reported crash. To facilitate evaluation, we introduce BugCraft-Bench, a curated dataset of Minecraft crash bug reports. On BugCraft-Bench, our framework end-to-end reproduced 34.9% of crash bugs with GPT-4.1, outperforming baseline computer-use models by 37%. BugCraft demonstrates the feasibility of automated reproduction of crash bugs in complex game environments using LLMs, opening promising avenues for game testing and development. Finally, we make our code open at https://bugcraft2025.github.io

<title>On the Mathematical Relationship Between Layer Normalization and Dynamic Activation Functions</title>

Abstract: Layer normalization (LN) is an essential component of modern neural networks. While many alternative techniques have been proposed, none of them have succeeded in replacing LN so far. The latest suggestion in this line of research is a dynamic activation function called Dynamic Tanh (DyT). Although it is empirically well-motivated and appealing from a practical point of view, it lacks a theoretical foundation. In this work, we shed light on the mathematical relationship between LN and dynamic activation functions. In particular, we derive DyT from the LN variant RMSNorm, and show that a well-defined decoupling in derivative space as well as an approximation are needed to do so. By applying the same decoupling procedure directly in function space, we are able to omit the approximation and obtain the exact element-wise counterpart of RMSNorm, which we call Dynamic Inverse Square Root Unit (DyISRU). We demonstrate numerically that DyISRU reproduces the normalization effect on outliers more accurately than DyT does.

Abstract: We propose L2T, an advancement of visual instruction tuning (VIT). While VIT equips Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) with promising multimodal capabilities, the current design choices for VIT often result in overfitting and shortcut learning, potentially degrading performance. This gap arises from an overemphasis on instruction-following abilities, while neglecting the proactive understanding of visual information. Inspired by this, L2T adopts a simple yet effective approach by incorporating the loss function into both the instruction and response sequences. It seamlessly expands the training data, and regularizes the MLLMs from overly relying on language priors. Based on this merit, L2T achieves a significant relative improvement of up to 9% on comprehensive multimodal benchmarks, requiring no additional training data and incurring negligible computational overhead. Surprisingly, L2T attains exceptional fundamental visual capabilities, yielding up to an 18% improvement in captioning performance, while simultaneously alleviating hallucination in MLLMs. Github code: https://github.com/Feng-Hong/L2T.

<title>Post-Incorporating Code Structural Knowledge into Pretrained Models via ICL for Code Translation</title>

Abstract: Code translation migrates codebases across programming languages. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advancements in software mining. However, handling the syntactic structure of source code remains a challenge. Classic syntax-aware methods depend on intricate model architectures and loss functions, rendering their integration into LLM training resource-intensive. This paper employs in-context learning (ICL), which directly integrates task exemplars into the input context, to post-incorporate code structural knowledge into pre-trained LLMs. We revisit exemplar selection in ICL from an information-theoretic perspective, proposing that list-wise selection based on information coverage is more precise and general objective than traditional methods based on combining similarity and diversity. To address the challenges of quantifying information coverage, we introduce a surrogate measure, Coverage of Abstract Syntax Tree (CAST). Furthermore, we formulate the NP-hard CAST maximization for exemplar selection and prove that it is a standard submodular maximization problem. Therefore, we propose a greedy algorithm for CAST submodular maximization, which theoretically guarantees a (1-1/e)-approximate solution in polynomial time complexity. Our method is the first training-free and model-agnostic approach to post-incorporate code structural knowledge into existing LLMs at test time. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves LLMs performance and reveals two meaningful insights: 1) Code structural knowledge can be effectively post-incorporated into pre-trained LLMs during inference, despite being overlooked during training; 2) Scaling up model size or training data does not lead to the emergence of code structural knowledge, underscoring the necessity of explicitly considering code syntactic structure.

<title>PartialLoading: User Scheduling and Bandwidth Allocation for Parameter-sharing Edge Inference</title>

Abstract: By provisioning inference offloading services, edge inference drives the rapid growth of AI applications at network edge. However, how to reduce the inference latency remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, we develop a parameter-sharing AI model loading (PartialLoading) framework for multi-user edge inference, which exploits two key insights: 1) the majority of latency arises from loading AI models into server GPU memory, and 2) different AI models can share a significant number of parameters, for which redundant loading should be avoided. Towards this end, we formulate a joint multi-user scheduling and spectrum bandwidth allocation problem to maximize task throughput by exploiting shared parameter blocks across models. The intuition is to judiciously schedule user requests to reuse the shared parameter blocks between consecutively loaded models, thereby reducing model loading time substantially. To facilitate solution finding, we decouple the problem into two sub-problems, i.e., user scheduling and bandwidth allocation, showing that solving them sequentially leads to the solution to the original problem. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, we first study an important special case called the "backbone-sharing" case, and design a dynamic programming-based algorithm to obtain the optimal solution in polynomial time. For the general case, we propose a greedy heuristic to obtain the sub-optimal solution efficiently. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves task throughput under deadline constraints compared with user scheduling without exploiting parameter sharing.

Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) driven by Transformer architectures has advanced significantly, yet faces challenges with low-resource language pairs like Vietnamese-Japanese (Vi-Ja). Issues include sparse parallel data and handling linguistic/cultural nuances. Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) with strong reasoning, often refined via Reinforcement Learning (RL), enables high-quality synthetic data generation. We introduce VNJPTranslate, a pipeline designed to systematically address the Vi-Ja translation task. It features a targeted data augmentation strategy using advanced LLMs with Chain-of-Thought prompting for challenging segments identified via corpus analysis. Subsequently, we employ efficient fine-tuning techniques (Unsloth with QLoRA) on a capable, low-parameter autoregressive model (specifically, a fine-tuned version of the 1.8B parameter Sailor model, which is based on the Qwen architecture) to create a practical and high-performing translation system. This integrated approach aims to improve Vi-Ja translation quality significantly over existing baselines.

Abstract: The impact of frontier AI in cybersecurity is rapidly increasing. In this paper, we comprehensively analyze this trend through three distinct lenses: a quantitative benchmark analysis, a literature review, and an expert survey. We find that while AI is already widely used in attacks, its application in defense remains limited, especially in remediation and deployment. Aligned with these analyses, experts expect AI to continue favoring attackers over defenders, though the gap will gradually narrow. These findings underscore the urgent need to mitigate frontier AI's risks while closely monitoring emerging capabilities. We provide concrete calls-to-action regarding: the construction of new cybersecurity benchmarks, the development of AI agents for defense, the design of provably secure AI agents, the improvement of pre-deployment security testing and transparency, and the strengthening of user-oriented education and defenses. Our paper summary and blog are available at https://rdi.berkeley.edu/frontier-ai-impact-on-cybersecurity/.

Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have long been a hot topic in the cybersecurity community. In recent years, with the introduction of deep learning (DL) techniques, IDS have made great progress due to their increasing generalizability. The rationale behind this is that by learning the underlying patterns of known system behaviors, IDS detection can be generalized to intrusions that exploit zero-day vulnerabilities. In this survey, we refer to this type of IDS as DL-based IDS (DL-IDS). From the perspective of DL, this survey systematically reviews all the stages of DL-IDS, including data collection, log storage, log parsing, graph summarization, attack detection, and attack investigation. To accommodate current researchers, a section describing the publicly available benchmark datasets is included. This survey further discusses current challenges and potential future research directions, aiming to help researchers understand the basic ideas and visions of DL-IDS research, as well as to motivate their research interests.

Abstract: Human infants rapidly develop visual reasoning skills from minimal input, suggesting that developmentally inspired pretraining could significantly enhance the efficiency of vision-language models (VLMs). Although recent efforts have leveraged infant-inspired datasets like SAYCam, existing evaluation benchmarks remain misaligned--they are either too simplistic, narrowly scoped, or tailored for large-scale pretrained models. Additionally, training exclusively on infant data overlooks the broader, diverse input from which infants naturally learn. To address these limitations, we propose BabyVLM, a novel framework comprising comprehensive in-domain evaluation benchmarks and a synthetic training dataset created via child-directed transformations of existing datasets. We demonstrate that VLMs trained with our synthetic dataset achieve superior performance on BabyVLM tasks compared to models trained solely on SAYCam or general-purpose data of the SAYCam size. BabyVLM thus provides a robust, developmentally aligned evaluation tool and illustrates how compact models trained on carefully curated data can generalize effectively, opening pathways toward data-efficient vision-language learning paradigms.

Abstract: Large language models~(LLMs) are expected to be helpful, harmless, and honest. In different alignment scenarios, such as safety, confidence, and general preference alignment, binary preference data collection and reward modeling are resource-intensive but play a central role in transferring human preferences. In this work, we explore using the similarity between sampled generations and reference answers as a supplementary reward function for alignment. When unary reference answers are available, such similarity-based rewards can circumvent the need for binary preference data and explicit reward modeling. We introduce \textit{RefAlign}, a versatile REINFORCE-style alignment algorithm that does not rely on reward or reference models. RefAlign utilizes language generation evaluation metrics, such as BERTScore, between sampled generations and reference answers as surrogate rewards. Beyond general preference optimization, RefAlign can be naturally extended to diverse scenarios, including safety and confidence alignment, by combining similarity-based rewards with task-specific objectives. Across multiple scenarios, RefAlign achieves performance comparable to prior alignment methods while operating without binary preference data or reward models. The code is available at https://github.com/mzhaoshuai/RefAlign.

Abstract: Clinical case reports encode temporal patient trajectories that are often underexploited by traditional machine learning methods relying on structured data. In this work, we introduce the forecasting problem from textual time series, where timestamped clinical findings -- extracted via an LLM-assisted annotation pipeline -- serve as the primary input for prediction. We systematically evaluate a diverse suite of models, including fine-tuned decoder-based large language models and encoder-based transformers, on tasks of event occurrence prediction, temporal ordering, and survival analysis. Our experiments reveal that encoder-based models consistently achieve higher F1 scores and superior temporal concordance for short- and long-horizon event forecasting, while fine-tuned masking approaches enhance ranking performance. In contrast, instruction-tuned decoder models demonstrate a relative advantage in survival analysis, especially in early prognosis settings. Our sensitivity analyses further demonstrate the importance of time ordering, which requires clinical time series construction, as compared to text ordering, the format of the text inputs that LLMs are classically trained on. This highlights the additional benefit that can be ascertained from time-ordered corpora, with implications for temporal tasks in the era of widespread LLM use.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms underpin modern deep learning, while the quadratic time and space complexity limit scalability for long sequences. To address this, Quantum Annealing Multi-Head Attention (QAMA) is proposed, a novel drop-in operator that reformulates attention as an energy-based Hamiltonian optimization problem. In this framework, token interactions are encoded into binary quadratic terms, and quantum annealing is employed to search for low-energy configurations that correspond to effective attention patterns. Unlike classical sparse or approximate attention methods that rely on hand-crafted heuristics, QAMA allows sparsity structures to emerge naturally from the optimization process. Theoretically, computational complexity is analysed through single-spin flip dynamics, providing time to solution runtime bounds that depend on the spectral properties of the annealing Hamiltonian. Empirically, evaluation on both natural language and vision benchmarks shows that, across tasks, accuracy deviates by at most 2.7 points from standard multi-head attention, while requiring only linear qubits in sequence length. Visualizations further reveal that the Hamiltonian penalty terms induce meaningful and interpretable sparsity across heads. Finally, deployment on a coherent Ising machine validates the feasibility of running QAMA on real quantum hardware, showing tangible inference-time reductions compared with classical implementations. These results highlight QAMA as a pioneering and scalable step toward integrating quantum optimization devices into deep neural architectures, providing a seamlessly integrable and hardware-compatible alternative to conventional attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, demonstrate impressive long-horizon reasoning capabilities. However, their reliance on static internal knowledge limits their performance on complex, knowledge-intensive tasks and hinders their ability to produce comprehensive research reports requiring synthesis of diverse web information. To address this, we propose WebThinker, a deep research agent that empowers LRMs to autonomously search the web, navigate among web pages, and draft reports during the reasoning process. WebThinker integrates a Deep Web Explorer module, enabling LRMs to dynamically search, navigate, and extract information from the web when encountering knowledge gaps. It also employs an Autonomous Think-Search-and-Draft strategy, allowing the model to seamlessly interleave reasoning, information gathering, and report writing in real time. To further enhance research tool utilization, we introduce an RL-based training strategy via iterative online Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Extensive experiments on complex reasoning benchmarks (GPQA, GAIA, WebWalkerQA, HLE) and scientific report generation tasks (Glaive) demonstrate that WebThinker significantly outperforms existing methods and strong proprietary systems. Our approach enhances LRM reliability and applicability in complex scenarios, paving the way for more capable and versatile deep research systems.

Abstract: We present ViDRiP-LLaVA, the first large multimodal model (LMM) in computational pathology that integrates three distinct image scenarios, including single patch images, automatically segmented pathology video clips, and manually segmented pathology videos. This integration closely mirrors the natural diagnostic process of pathologists. By generating detailed histological descriptions and culminating in a definitive sign-out diagnosis, ViDRiP-LLaVA bridges visual narratives with diagnostic reasoning. Central to our approach is the ViDRiP-Instruct dataset, comprising 4278 video and diagnosis-specific chain-of-thought instructional pairs sourced from educational histopathology videos on YouTube. Although high-quality data is critical for enhancing diagnostic reasoning, its creation is time-intensive and limited in volume. To overcome this challenge, we transfer knowledge from existing single-image instruction datasets to train on weakly annotated, keyframe-extracted clips, followed by fine-tuning on manually segmented videos. ViDRiP-LLaVA establishes a new benchmark in pathology video analysis and offers a promising foundation for future AI systems that support clinical decision-making through integrated visual and diagnostic reasoning. Our code, data, and model are publicly available at: https://github.com/QuIIL/ViDRiP-LLaVA.

<title>LiTransProQA: an LLM-based Literary Translation evaluation metric with Professional Question Answering</title>

Abstract: The impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) has extended into literary domains. However, existing evaluation metrics for literature prioritize mechanical accuracy over artistic expression and tend to overrate machine translation as being superior to human translation from experienced professionals. In the long run, this bias could result in an irreversible decline in translation quality and cultural authenticity. In response to the urgent need for a specialized literary evaluation metric, we introduce LITRANSPROQA, a novel, reference-free, LLM-based question-answering framework designed for literary translation evaluation. LITRANSPROQA integrates humans in the loop to incorporate insights from professional literary translators and researchers, focusing on critical elements in literary quality assessment such as literary devices, cultural understanding, and authorial voice. Our extensive evaluation shows that while literary-finetuned XCOMET-XL yields marginal gains, LITRANSPROQA substantially outperforms current metrics, achieving up to 0.07 gain in correlation and surpassing the best state-of-the-art metrics by over 15 points in adequacy assessments. Incorporating professional translator insights as weights further improves performance, highlighting the value of translator inputs. Notably, LITRANSPROQA reaches an adequacy performance comparable to trained linguistic student evaluators, though it still falls behind experienced professional translators. LITRANSPROQA shows broad applicability to open-source models like LLaMA3.3-70b and Qwen2.5-32b, indicating its potential as an accessible and training-free tool for evaluating literary translations that require local processing due to copyright or ethical considerations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated success in generalizing across decision-making tasks including planning, control, and prediction, but their tendency to hallucinate unsafe and undesired outputs poses risks. We argue that detecting such failures is necessary, especially in safety-critical scenarios. Existing methods for black-box models often detect hallucinations by identifying inconsistencies across multiple samples. Many of these approaches typically introduce prompt perturbations like randomizing detail order or generating adversarial inputs, with the intuition that a confident model should produce stable outputs. We first perform a manual case study showing that other forms of perturbations (e.g., adding noise, removing sensor details) cause LLMs to hallucinate in a multi-agent driving environment. We then propose a novel method for efficiently searching the space of prompt perturbations using adaptive stress testing (AST) with Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS). Our AST formulation enables discovery of scenarios and prompts that cause language models to act with high uncertainty or even crash. By generating MCTS prompt perturbation trees across diverse scenarios, we show through extensive experiments that offline analyses can be used at runtime to automatically generate prompts that influence model uncertainty, and to inform real-time trust assessments of an LLM. We further characterize LLMs deployed as planners in a single-agent lunar lander environment and in a multi-agent robot crowd navigation simulation. Overall, ours is one of the first hallucination intervention algorithms to pave a path towards rigorous characterization of black-box LLM planners.

Abstract: Diffusion-based planners have shown strong performance in short-horizon tasks but often fail in complex, long-horizon settings. We trace the failure to loose coupling between high-level (HL) sub-goal selection and low-level (LL) trajectory generation, which leads to incoherent plans and degraded performance. We propose Coupled Hierarchical Diffusion (CHD), a framework that models HL sub-goals and LL trajectories jointly within a unified diffusion process. A shared classifier passes LL feedback upstream so that sub-goals self-correct while sampling proceeds. This tight HL-LL coupling improves trajectory coherence and enables scalable long-horizon diffusion planning. Experiments across maze navigation, tabletop manipulation, and household environments show that CHD consistently outperforms both flat and hierarchical diffusion baselines.

Abstract: The progress of AI is bottlenecked by the quality of evaluation, making powerful LLM-as-a-Judge models a core solution. The efficacy of these judges depends on their chain-of-thought reasoning, creating a critical need for methods that can effectively optimize this reasoning process. In this work, we introduce J1, a reinforcement learning framework for teaching LLM judges to think before making decisions. Our core contribution lies in converting all judgment tasks for non-verifiable and verifiable prompts into a unified format with verifiable rewards, enabling direct optimization of evaluation quality while mitigating positional bias. We then use RL to train thinking-judges at scales of 8B, 32B, and 70B and show that they obtain state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks. In particular, J1-Qwen-32B, our multitasked pointwise and pairwise judge also outperforms o1-mini, o3, and a much larger 671B DeepSeek-R1 on some benchmarks, while only training on synthetic data. Through comprehensive ablations of pairwise, pointwise, and multitask J1 variants, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across seed prompts, reward strategies, and training recipes. Qualitative analysis reveals that J1 develops systematic evaluation strategies, including dynamic criteria generation, reference answer creation, iterative self-correction of initial assessments, and feedback generation for low-quality responses.

Abstract: We propose the first unified adversarial attack benchmark for Genomic Foundation Models (GFMs), named GenoArmory. Unlike existing GFM benchmarks, GenoArmory offers the first comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess the vulnerability of GFMs to adversarial attacks. Methodologically, we evaluate the adversarial robustness of five state-of-the-art GFMs using four widely adopted attack algorithms and three defense strategies. Importantly, our benchmark provides an accessible and comprehensive framework to analyze GFM vulnerabilities with respect to model architecture, quantization schemes, and training datasets. Additionally, we introduce GenoAdv, a new adversarial sample dataset designed to improve GFM safety. Empirically, classification models exhibit greater robustness to adversarial perturbations compared to generative models, highlighting the impact of task type on model vulnerability. Moreover, adversarial attacks frequently target biologically significant genomic regions, suggesting that these models effectively capture meaningful sequence features.

Abstract: Garment manipulation is a critical challenge due to the diversity in garment categories, geometries, and deformations. Despite this, humans can effortlessly handle garments, thanks to the dexterity of our hands. However, existing research in the field has struggled to replicate this level of dexterity, primarily hindered by the lack of realistic simulations of dexterous garment manipulation. Therefore, we propose DexGarmentLab, the first environment specifically designed for dexterous (especially bimanual) garment manipulation, which features large-scale high-quality 3D assets for 15 task scenarios, and refines simulation techniques tailored for garment modeling to reduce the sim-to-real gap. Previous data collection typically relies on teleoperation or training expert reinforcement learning (RL) policies, which are labor-intensive and inefficient. In this paper, we leverage garment structural correspondence to automatically generate a dataset with diverse trajectories using only a single expert demonstration, significantly reducing manual intervention. However, even extensive demonstrations cannot cover the infinite states of garments, which necessitates the exploration of new algorithms. To improve generalization across diverse garment shapes and deformations, we propose a Hierarchical gArment-manipuLation pOlicy (HALO). It first identifies transferable affordance points to accurately locate the manipulation area, then generates generalizable trajectories to complete the task. Through extensive experiments and detailed analysis of our method and baseline, we demonstrate that HALO consistently outperforms existing methods, successfully generalizing to previously unseen instances even with significant variations in shape and deformation where others fail.

<title>SoLoPO: Unlocking Long-Context Capabilities in LLMs via Short-to-Long Preference Optimization</title>

arXiv:2505.11166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite advances in pretraining with extended context lengths, large language models (LLMs) still face challenges in effectively utilizing real-world long-context information, primarily due to insufficient long-context alignment caused by data quality issues, training inefficiencies, and the lack of well-designed optimization objectives. To address these limitations, we propose a framework named $\textbf{S}$h$\textbf{o}$rt-to-$\textbf{Lo}$ng $\textbf{P}$reference $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{SoLoPO}$), decoupling long-context preference optimization (PO) into two components: short-context PO and short-to-long reward alignment (SoLo-RA), supported by both theoretical and empirical evidence. Specifically, short-context PO leverages preference pairs sampled from short contexts to enhance the model's contextual knowledge utilization ability. Meanwhile, SoLo-RA explicitly encourages reward score consistency utilization for the responses when conditioned on both short and long contexts that contain identical task-relevant information. This facilitates transferring the model's ability to handle short contexts into long-context scenarios. SoLoPO is compatible with mainstream preference optimization algorithms, while substantially improving the efficiency of data construction and training processes. Experimental results show that SoLoPO enhances all these algorithms with respect to stronger length and domain generalization abilities across various long-context benchmarks, while achieving notable improvements in both computational and memory efficiency.

Abstract: Many prediction problems across science and engineering, especially in finance and economics, involve large cross-sections of individual time series, where each unit (e.g., a loan, stock, or customer) is driven by unit-level features and latent cross-sectional dynamics. While sequence models have advanced per-unit temporal prediction, capturing cross-sectional effects often still relies on hand-crafted summary features. We propose Set-Sequence, a model that learns cross-sectional structure directly, enhancing expressivity and eliminating manual feature engineering. At each time step, a permutation-invariant Set module summarizes the unit set; a Sequence module then models each unit's dynamics conditioned on both its features and the learned summary. The architecture accommodates unaligned series, supports varying numbers of units at inference, integrates with standard sequence backbones (e.g., Transformers), and scales linearly in cross-sectional size. Across a synthetic contagion task and two large-scale real-world applications, equity portfolio optimization and loan risk prediction, Set-Sequence significantly outperforms strong baselines, delivering higher Sharpe ratios, improved AUCs, and interpretable cross-sectional summaries.

<title>Quantization Meets Reasoning: Exploring and Mitigating Degradation of Low-Bit LLMs in Mathematical Reasoning</title>

arXiv:2505.11574v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-bit post-training quantization (PTQ) is a practical route to deploy reasoning-capable LLMs under tight memory and latency budgets, yet it can markedly impair mathematical reasoning (drops up to 69.81% in our harder settings). We address two deployment-critical questions with process-level precision: Where along a step-structured solution does degradation first arise? How to mitigate it while staying in the low-bit regime? Across widely used PTQ methods (AWQ, GPTQ, SmoothQuant), open-source model families (Qwen, LLaMA; 0.5--7B), and math reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, AIME), we perform format-aligned chain-of-thought with step-aligned attribution and uncover two robust regularities: (i) PTQ disproportionately elevates method and execution errors relative to high-level conceptual mistakes; and (ii) failures emerge early, with the first vulnerable step flipping and cascading to the final answer. These regularities suggest a general intervention principle: restore local token-level margins exactly at the earliest failure frontier. We instantiate this principle as a lightweight measure$\rightarrow$locate$\rightarrow$restore loop that operates directly on the quantized model: detect the first faulty step, construct our "Silver Bullet" datasets, and apply small-scale supervised/preference tuning. In our settings, as few as 332 curated examples and 3--5 minutes of compute on a single GPU recover 4-bit weight math reasoning toward the full-precision baseline while preserving PTQ efficiency. Our framework is quantizer- and architecture-agnostic within the evaluated regimes, and turns low-bit degradation from a global accuracy problem into a local, reproducible process intervention.

Abstract: Fair classification is a critical challenge that has gained increasing importance due to international regulations and its growing use in high-stakes decision-making settings. Existing methods often rely on adversarial learning or distribution matching across sensitive groups; however, adversarial learning can be unstable, and distribution matching can be computationally intensive. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach based on the characteristic function distance. Our method ensures that the learned representation contains minimal sensitive information while maintaining high effectiveness for downstream tasks. By utilizing characteristic functions, we achieve a more stable and efficient solution compared to traditional methods. Additionally, we introduce a simple relaxation of the objective function that guarantees fairness in common classification models with no performance degradation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently matches or achieves better fairness and predictive accuracy than existing methods. Moreover, our method maintains robustness and computational efficiency, making it a practical solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: Training high-performing Small Language Models (SLMs) remains costly, even with knowledge distillation and pruning from larger teacher models. Existing work often faces three key challenges: (1) information loss from hard pruning, (2) inefficient alignment of representations, and (3) underutilization of informative activations, particularly from Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs). To address these challenges, we introduce Low-Rank Clone (LRC), an efficient pre-training method that constructs SLMs aspiring to behavioral equivalence with strong teacher models. LRC trains a set of low-rank projection matrices that jointly enable soft pruning by compressing teacher weights, and activation clone by aligning student activations, including FFN signals, with those of the teacher. This unified design maximizes knowledge transfer while removing the need for explicit alignment modules. Extensive experiments with open-source teachers (e.g., Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-3B/7B-Instruct) show that LRC matches or surpasses state-of-the-art models trained on trillions of tokens--while using only 20B tokens, achieving over 1,000x training efficiency. Our codes and model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/CURRENTF/LowRankClone and https://huggingface.co/collections/JitaiHao/low-rank-clone-lrc-6828389e96a93f1d4219dfaf.

Abstract: Unlike conventional "black-box" transformers with classical self-attention mechanism, we build a lightweight and interpretable transformer-like neural net by unrolling a mixed-graph-based optimization algorithm to forecast traffic with spatial and temporal dimensions. We construct two graphs: an undirected graph $\mathcal{G}^u$ capturing spatial correlations across geography, and a directed graph $\mathcal{G}^d$ capturing sequential relationships over time. We predict future samples of signal $\mathbf{x}$, assuming it is "smooth" with respect to both $\mathcal{G}^u$ and $\mathcal{G}^d$, where we design new $\ell_2$ and $\ell_1$-norm variational terms to quantify and promote signal smoothness (low-frequency reconstruction) on a directed graph. We design an iterative algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and unroll it into a feed-forward network for data-driven parameter learning. We insert graph learning modules for $\mathcal{G}^u$ and $\mathcal{G}^d$ that play the role of self-attention. Experiments show that our unrolled networks achieve competitive traffic forecast performance as state-of-the-art prediction schemes, while reducing parameter counts drastically. Our code is available in https://github.com/SingularityUndefined/Unrolling-GSP-STForecast .

Abstract: Safety guardrails in large language models (LLMs) are a critical component in preventing harmful outputs. Yet, their resilience under perturbation remains poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of safety fine-tuning in LLMs by systematically injecting Gaussian noise into model activations. We show across multiple open-weight models that (1) Gaussian noise raises harmful-output rates (p < 0.001) by up to 27%, (2) that deeper safety fine-tuning affords no extra protection, and (3) that chain-of-thought reasoning remains largely intact. The findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in current safety alignment techniques and highlight the potential of reasoning-based and reinforcement learning approaches as promising direction for developing more robust AI safety systems. These results have important implications for real-world deployment of LLMs in safety-critical applications as these results imply that widely-deployed safety tuning methods can fail even without adversarial prompts.

<title>Breaking the Compression Ceiling: Data-Free Pipeline for Ultra-Efficient Delta Compression</title>

Abstract: With the rise of the fine-tuned-pretrained paradigm, storing numerous fine-tuned models for multi-tasking creates significant storage overhead. Delta compression alleviates this by storing only the pretrained model and the highly compressed delta weights (the differences between fine-tuned and pretrained model weights). However, existing methods fail to maintain both high compression and performance, and often rely on data. To address these challenges, we propose UltraDelta, the first data-free delta compression pipeline that achieves both ultra-high compression and strong performance. UltraDelta is designed to minimize redundancy, maximize information, and stabilize performance across inter-layer, intra-layer, and global dimensions, using three key components: (1) Variance-Based Mixed Sparsity Allocation assigns sparsity based on variance, giving lower sparsity to high-variance layers to preserve inter-layer information. (2) Distribution-Aware Compression applies uniform quantization and then groups parameters by value, followed by group-wise pruning, to better preserve intra-layer distribution. (3) Trace-Norm-Guided Rescaling uses the trace norm of delta weights to estimate a global rescaling factor, improving model stability under higher compression. Extensive experiments across (a) large language models (fine-tuned on LLaMA-2 7B and 13B) with up to 50x compression, (b) general NLP models (RoBERTa-base, T5-base) with up to 224x compression, (c) vision models (ViT-B/32, ViT-L/14) with up to 132x compression, and (d) multi-modal models (BEiT-3) with 18x compression, demonstrate that UltraDelta consistently outperforms existing methods, especially under ultra-high compression. Code is available at https://github.com/xiaohuiwang000/UltraDelta.

Abstract: Recently released LLMs have strong multilingual \& multimodal capabilities. Model vulnerabilities are exposed using audits and red-teaming efforts. Existing efforts have focused primarily on the English language; thus, models continue to be susceptible to multilingual jailbreaking strategies, especially for multimodal contexts. In this study, we introduce a novel strategy that leverages code-mixing and phonetic perturbations to jailbreak LLMs for both text and image generation tasks. We also present an extension to a current jailbreak-template-based strategy and propose a novel template, showing higher effectiveness than baselines. Our work presents a method to effectively bypass safety filters in LLMs while maintaining interpretability by applying phonetic misspellings to sensitive words in code-mixed prompts. We achieve a 99\% Attack Success Rate for text generation and 78\% for image generation, with Attack Relevance Rate of 100\% for text generation and 96\% for image generation for the phonetically perturbed code-mixed prompts. Our interpretability experiments reveal that phonetic perturbations impact word tokenization, leading to jailbreak success. Our study motivates increasing the focus towards more generalizable safety alignment for multilingual multimodal models, especially in real-world settings wherein prompts can have misspelt words. \textit{\textbf{Warning: This paper contains examples of potentially harmful and offensive content.}}

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models across various modalities, including image, video, and audio synthesis. However, their deployment is often limited by significant inference latency, primarily due to the inherently sequential nature of the denoising process. While existing parallelization strategies attempt to accelerate inference by distributing computation across multiple devices, they typically incur high communication overhead, hindering deployment on commercial hardware. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{ParaStep}, a novel parallelization method based on a reuse-then-predict mechanism that parallelizes diffusion inference by exploiting similarity between adjacent denoising steps. Unlike prior approaches that rely on layer-wise or stage-wise communication, ParaStep employs lightweight, step-wise communication, substantially reducing overhead. ParaStep achieves end-to-end speedups of up to \textbf{3.88}$\times$ on SVD, \textbf{2.43}$\times$ on CogVideoX-2b, and \textbf{6.56}$\times$ on AudioLDM2-large, while maintaining generation quality. These results highlight ParaStep as a scalable and communication-efficient solution for accelerating diffusion inference, particularly in bandwidth-constrained environments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can transform education, but their optimization for direct question-answering often undermines effective pedagogy which requires strategically withholding answers. To mitigate this, we propose an online reinforcement learning (RL)-based alignment framework that can quickly adapt LLMs into effective tutors using simulated student-tutor interactions by emphasizing pedagogical quality and guided problem-solving over simply giving away answers. We use our method to train a 7B parameter tutor model without human annotations which reaches similar performance to larger proprietary models like LearnLM. We introduce a controllable reward weighting to balance pedagogical support and student solving accuracy, allowing us to trace the Pareto frontier between these two objectives. Our models better preserve reasoning capabilities than single-turn SFT baselines and can optionally enhance interpretability through thinking tags that expose the model's instructional planning.

Abstract: Personalizing jargon detection and explanation is essential for making technical documents accessible to readers with diverse disciplinary backgrounds. However, tailoring models to individual users typically requires substantial annotation efforts and computational resources due to user-specific finetuning. To address this, we present a systematic study of personalized jargon detection, focusing on methods that are both efficient and scalable for real-world deployment. We explore two personalization strategies: (1) lightweight finetuning using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on open-source models, and (2) personalized prompting, which tailors model behavior at inference time without retaining. To reflect realistic constraints, we also investigate semi-supervised approaches that combine limited annotated data with self-supervised learning from users' publications. Our personalized LoRA model outperforms GPT-4 with contextual prompting by 21.4% in F1 score and exceeds the best performing oracle baseline by 8.3%. Remarkably, our method achieves comparable performance using only 10% of the annotated training data, demonstrating its practicality for resource-constrained settings. Our study offers the first work to systematically explore efficient, low-resource personalization of jargon detection using open-source language models, offering a practical path toward scalable, user-adaptive NLP system.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) leverages large language models (LLMs) combined with external contexts to enhance the accuracy and reliability of generated responses. However, reliably attributing generated content to specific context segments, context attribution, remains challenging due to the computationally intensive nature of current methods, which often require extensive fine-tuning or human annotation. In this work, we introduce a novel Jensen-Shannon Divergence driven method to Attribute Response to Context (ARC-JSD), enabling efficient and accurate identification of essential context sentences without additional fine-tuning, gradient-calculation or surrogate modelling. Evaluations on a wide range of RAG benchmarks, such as TyDi QA, Hotpot QA, and Musique, using instruction-tuned LLMs in different scales demonstrate superior accuracy and significant computational efficiency improvements compared to the previous surrogate-based method. Furthermore, our mechanistic analysis reveals specific attention heads and multilayer perceptron (MLP) layers responsible for context attribution, providing valuable insights into the internal workings of RAG models and how they affect RAG behaviours. Our code is available at https://github.com/ruizheliUOA/ARC_JSD.

<title>Your Pre-trained LLM is Secretly an Unsupervised Confidence Calibrator</title>

Abstract: Post-training of large language models is essential for adapting pre-trained language models (PLMs) to align with human preferences and downstream tasks. While PLMs typically exhibit well-calibrated confidence, post-trained language models (PoLMs) often suffer from over-confidence, assigning high confidence to both correct and incorrect outputs, which can undermine reliability in critical applications. A major obstacle in calibrating PoLMs is the scarcity of labeled data for individual downstream tasks. To address this, we propose Disagreement-Aware Confidence Alignment (DACA), a novel unsupervised method to optimize the parameters (e.g., temperature $\tau$) in post-hoc confidence calibration. Our method is motivated by the under-confidence issue caused by prediction disagreement between the PLM and PoLM while aligning their confidence via temperature scaling. Theoretically, the PLM's confidence underestimates PoLM's prediction accuracy on disagreement examples, causing a larger $\tau$ and producing under-confident predictions. DACA mitigates this by selectively using only agreement examples for calibration, effectively decoupling the influence of disagreement. In this manner, our method avoids an overly large $\tau$ in temperature scaling caused by disagreement examples, improving calibration performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, improving the average ECE of open-sourced and API-based LLMs (e.g. GPT-4o) by up to 15.08$\%$ on common benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant computational and memory challenges due to their extensive size, making pruning essential for their efficient deployment. Existing one-shot pruning methods often apply uniform sparsity constraints across layers or within each layer, resulting in suboptimal performance, especially at high sparsity ratios. This work introduces TRIM (Targeted Row-wise Iterative Metric-driven pruning), a novel approach that applies varying sparsity ratios to individual output dimensions (rows) within each layer. TRIM employs an iterative adjustment process guided by quality metrics to optimize dimension-wise sparsity allocation, focusing on reducing variance in quality retention across outputs to preserve critical information. TRIM can be seamlessly integrated with existing layer-wise pruning strategies. Our evaluations on perplexity and zero-shot tasks across diverse LLM families (Qwen2.5, LLaMA-2, and OPT) and sparsity levels demonstrate that TRIM achieves new state-of-the-art results and enhances stability. For instance, at 80% sparsity, TRIM reduces perplexity by 48% for Qwen2.5-14B and over 90% for OPT-13B compared to baseline methods. We conclude that fine-grained, dimension-wise sparsity adaptation is crucial for pushing the limits of extreme LLM compression. Code available at: https://github.com/flobk/TRIM

Abstract: While recent text-to-image (T2I) models show impressive capabilities in synthesizing images from brief descriptions, their performance significantly degrades when confronted with long, detail-intensive prompts required in professional applications. We present DetailMaster, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate T2I models' systematic abilities to handle extended textual inputs that contain complex compositional requirements. Our benchmark introduces four critical evaluation dimensions: Character Attributes, Structured Character Locations, Multi-Dimensional Scene Attributes, and Spatial/Interactive Relationships. The benchmark comprises long and detail-rich prompts averaging 284.89 tokens, with high quality validated by expert annotators. Evaluation on 7 general-purpose and 5 long-prompt-optimized T2I models reveals critical performance limitations: state-of-the-art models achieve merely $\sim$50\% accuracy in key dimensions like attribute binding and spatial reasoning, while all models showing progressive performance degradation as prompt length increases. Our analysis reveals fundamental limitations in compositional reasoning, demonstrating that current encoders flatten complex grammatical structures and that diffusion models suffer from attribute leakage under detail-intensive conditions. We open-source our dataset, data curation code, and evaluation tools to advance detail-rich T2I generation and enable applications previously hindered by the lack of a dedicated benchmark.

Abstract: Long-term time-series forecasting (LTSF) models are often presented as general-purpose solutions that can be applied across domains, implicitly assuming that all data is pointwise predictable. Using chaotic systems such as Lorenz-63 as a case study, we argue that geometric structure - not pointwise prediction - is the right abstraction for a dynamic-agnostic foundational model. Minimizing the Wasserstein-2 distance (W2), which captures geometric changes, and providing a spectral view of dynamics are essential for long-horizon forecasting. Our model, FRIREN (Flow-inspired Representations via Interpretable Eigen-networks), implements an augmented normalizing-flow block that embeds data into a normally distributed latent representation. It then generates a W2-efficient optimal path that can be decomposed into rotation, scaling, inverse rotation, and translation. This architecture yields locally generated, geometry-preserving predictions that are independent of the underlying dynamics, and a global spectral representation that functions as a finite Koopman operator with a small modification. This enables practitioners to identify which modes grow, decay, or oscillate, both locally and system-wide. FRIREN achieves an MSE of 11.4, MAE of 1.6, and SWD of 0.96 on Lorenz-63 in a 336-in, 336-out, dt=0.01 setting, surpassing TimeMixer (MSE 27.3, MAE 2.8, SWD 2.1). The model maintains effective prediction for 274 out of 336 steps, approximately 2.5 Lyapunov times. On Rossler (96-in, 336-out), FRIREN achieves an MSE of 0.0349, MAE of 0.0953, and SWD of 0.0170, outperforming TimeMixer's MSE of 4.3988, MAE of 0.886, and SWD of 3.2065. FRIREN is also competitive on standard LTSF datasets such as ETT and Weather. By connecting modern generative flows with classical spectral analysis, FRIREN makes long-term forecasting both accurate and interpretable, setting a new benchmark for LTSF model design.

Abstract: Tactile sensing remains far less understood in neuroscience and less effective in artificial systems compared to more mature modalities such as vision and language. We bridge these gaps by introducing a novel Encoder-Attender-Decoder (EAD) framework to systematically explore the space of task-optimized temporal neural networks trained on realistic tactile input sequences from a customized rodent whisker-array simulator. We identify convolutional recurrent neural networks (ConvRNNs) as superior encoders to purely feedforward and state-space architectures for tactile categorization. Crucially, these ConvRNN-encoder-based EAD models achieve neural representations closely matching rodent somatosensory cortex, saturating the explainable neural variability and revealing a clear linear relationship between supervised categorization performance and neural alignment. Furthermore, contrastive self-supervised ConvRNN-encoder-based EADs, trained with tactile-specific augmentations, match supervised neural fits, serving as an ethologically-relevant, label-free proxy.
  For neuroscience, our findings highlight nonlinear recurrent processing as important for general-purpose tactile representations in somatosensory cortex, providing the first quantitative characterization of the underlying inductive biases in this system. For embodied AI, our results emphasize the importance of recurrent EAD architectures to handle realistic tactile inputs, along with tailored self-supervised learning methods for achieving robust tactile perception with the same type of sensors animals use to sense in unstructured environments.

<title>Shifting AI Efficiency From Model-Centric to Data-Centric Compression</title>

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) has historically relied on scaling model parameters. However, as hardware limits constrain further model growth, the primary computational bottleneck has shifted to the quadratic cost of self-attention over increasingly long sequences by ultra-long text contexts, high-resolution images, and extended videos. In this position paper, \textbf{we argue that the focus of research for efficient artificial intelligence (AI) is shifting from model-centric compression to data-centric compression}. We position data-centric compression as the emerging paradigm, which improves AI efficiency by directly compressing the volume of data processed during model training or inference. To formalize this shift, we establish a unified framework for existing efficiency strategies and demonstrate why it constitutes a crucial paradigm change for long-context AI. We then systematically review the landscape of data-centric compression methods, analyzing their benefits across diverse scenarios. Finally, we outline key challenges and promising future research directions. Our work aims to provide a novel perspective on AI efficiency, synthesize existing efforts, and catalyze innovation to address the challenges posed by ever-increasing context lengths.

<title>Rolling Ball Optimizer: Learning by ironing out loss landscape wrinkles</title>

Abstract: Training large neural networks (NNs) requires optimizing high-dimensional data-dependent loss functions. The optimization landscape of these functions is often highly complex and textured, even fractal-like, with many spurious local minima, ill-conditioned valleys, degenerate points, and saddle points. Complicating things further is the fact that these landscape characteristics are a function of the data, meaning that noise in the training data can propagate forward and give rise to unrepresentative small-scale geometry. This poses a difficulty for gradient-based optimization methods, which rely on local geometry to compute updates and are, therefore, vulnerable to being derailed by noisy data. In practice,this translates to a strong dependence of the optimization dynamics on the noise in the data, i.e., poor generalization performance. To remediate this problem, we propose a new optimization procedure: Rolling Ball Optimizer (RBO), that breaks this spatial locality by incorporating information from a larger region of the loss landscape in its updates. We achieve this by simulating the motion of a rigid sphere of finite radius rolling on the loss landscape, a straightforward generalization of Gradient Descent (GD) that simplifies into it in the infinitesimal limit. The radius serves as a hyperparameter that determines the scale at which RBO sees the loss landscape, allowing control over the granularity of its interaction therewith. We are motivated by the intuition that the large-scale geometry of the loss landscape is less data-specific than its fine-grained structure, and that it is easier to optimize. We support this intuition by proving that our algorithm has a smoothing effect on the loss function. Evaluation against SGD, SAM, and Entropy-SGD, on MNIST and CIFAR-10/100 demonstrates promising results in terms of convergence speed, training accuracy, and generalization performance.

<title>STRAP: Spatio-Temporal Pattern Retrieval for Out-of-Distribution Generalization</title>

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling dynamic graph-structured data across diverse domains. However, they often fail to generalize in Spatio-Temporal Out-of-Distribution (STOOD) scenarios, where both temporal dynamics and spatial structures evolve beyond the training distribution. To address this problem, we propose an innovative Spatio-Temporal Retrieval-Augmented Pattern Learning framework,STRAP, which enhances model generalization by integrating retrieval-augmented learning into the STGNN continue learning pipeline. The core of STRAP is a compact and expressive pattern library that stores representative spatio-temporal patterns enriched with historical, structural, and semantic information, which is obtained and optimized during the training phase. During inference, STRAP retrieves relevant patterns from this library based on similarity to the current input and injects them into the model via a plug-and-play prompting mechanism. This not only strengthens spatio-temporal representations but also mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Moreover, STRAP introduces a knowledge-balancing objective to harmonize new information with retrieved knowledge. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world streaming graph datasets show that STRAP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art STGNN baselines on STOOD tasks, demonstrating its robustness, adaptability, and strong generalization capability without task-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: We present MA-RAG, a Multi-Agent framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that addresses the inherent ambiguities and reasoning challenges in complex information-seeking tasks. Unlike conventional RAG methods that rely on end-to-end fine-tuning or isolated component enhancements, MA-RAG orchestrates a collaborative set of specialized AI agents: Planner, Step Definer, Extractor, and QA Agents, each responsible for a distinct stage of the RAG pipeline. By decomposing tasks into subtasks such as query disambiguation, evidence extraction, and answer synthesis, and enabling agents to communicate intermediate reasoning via chain-of-thought prompting, MA-RAG progressively refines retrieval and synthesis while maintaining modular interpretability. Extensive experiments on multi-hop and ambiguous QA benchmarks, including NQ, HotpotQA, 2WikimQA, and TriviaQA, demonstrate that MA-RAG significantly outperforms standalone LLMs and existing RAG methods across all model scales. Notably, even a small LLaMA3-8B model equipped with MA-RAG surpasses larger standalone LLMs, while larger variants (LLaMA3-70B and GPT-4o-mini) set new state-of-the-art results on challenging multi-hop datasets. Ablation studies reveal that both the planner and extractor agents are critical for multi-hop reasoning, and that high-capacity models are especially important for the QA agent to synthesize answers effectively. Beyond general-domain QA, MA-RAG generalizes to specialized domains such as medical QA, achieving competitive performance against domain-specific models without any domain-specific fine-tuning. Our results highlight the effectiveness of collaborative, modular reasoning in retrieval-augmented systems: MA-RAG not only improves answer accuracy and robustness but also provides interpretable intermediate reasoning steps, establishing a new paradigm for efficient and reliable multi-agent RAG.

Abstract: We present Multi-Scale Manifold Alignment(MSMA), an information-geometric framework that decomposes LLM representations into local, intermediate, and global manifolds and learns cross-scale mappings that preserve geometry and information. Across GPT-2, BERT, RoBERTa, and T5, we observe consistent hierarchical patterns and find that MSMA improves alignment metrics under multiple estimators (e.g., relative KL reduction and MI gains with statistical significance across seeds). Controlled interventions at different scales yield distinct and architecture-dependent effects on lexical diversity, sentence structure, and discourse coherence. While our theoretical analysis relies on idealized assumptions, the empirical results suggest that multi-objective alignment offers a practical lens for analyzing cross-scale information flow and guiding representation-level control.

<title>Empirical Investigation of Latent Representational Dynamics in Large Language Models: A Manifold Evolution Perspective</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces the Dynamical Manifold Evolution Theory (DMET), a conceptual framework that models large language model (LLM) generation as a continuous trajectory evolving on a low-dimensional semantic manifold. The theory characterizes latent dynamics through three interpretable metrics-state continuity ($C$), attractor compactness ($Q$), and topological persistence ($P$)-which jointly capture the smoothness, stability, and structure of representation evolution. Empirical analyses across multiple Transformer architectures reveal consistent links between these latent dynamics and text quality: smoother trajectories correspond to greater fluency, and richer topological organization correlates with enhanced coherence. Different models exhibit distinct dynamical regimes, reflecting diverse strategies of semantic organization in latent space. Moreover, decoding parameters such as temperature and top-$p$ shape these trajectories in predictable ways, defining a balanced region that harmonizes fluency and creativity. As a phenomenological rather than first-principles framework, DMET provides a unified and testable perspective for interpreting, monitoring, and guiding LLM behavior, offering new insights into the interplay between internal representation dynamics and external text generation quality.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to machine learning models by inducing incorrect predictions through imperceptible perturbations to input data. While these attacks are well studied in unstructured domains such as images, their behaviour on tabular data remains underexplored due to mixed feature types and complex inter-feature dependencies. This study introduces a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates adversarial attacks on tabular datasets with respect to both effectiveness and imperceptibility. We assess five white-box attack algorithms (FGSM, BIM, PGD, DeepFool, and C\&amp;W) across four representative models (LR, MLP, TabTransformer and FT-Transformer) using eleven datasets spanning finance, energy, and healthcare domains. The benchmark employs four quantitative imperceptibility metrics (proximity, sparsity, deviation, and sensitivity) to characterise perturbation realism. The analysis quantifies the trade-off between these two aspects and reveals consistent differences between attack types, with $\ell_\infty$-based attacks achieving higher success but lower subtlety, and $\ell_2$-based attacks offering more realistic perturbations. The benchmark findings offer actionable insights for designing more imperceptible adversarial attacks, advancing the understanding of adversarial vulnerability in tabular machine learning.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising approach for training clinical AI models without centralizing sensitive patient data. However, its real-world adoption is hindered by challenges related to privacy, resource constraints, and compliance. Existing Differential Privacy (DP) approaches often apply uniform noise, which disproportionately degrades model performance, even among well-compliant institutions. In this work, we propose a novel compliance-aware FL framework that enhances DP by adaptively adjusting noise based on quantifiable client compliance scores. Additionally, we introduce a compliance scoring tool based on key healthcare and security standards to promote secure, inclusive, and equitable participation across diverse clinical settings. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that integrating under-resourced, less compliant clinics with highly regulated institutions yields accuracy improvements of up to 15% over traditional FL. This work advances FL by balancing privacy, compliance, and performance, making it a viable solution for real-world clinical workflows in global healthcare.

Abstract: Autoregressive language models (LMs) generate one token at a time, yet human reasoning operates over higher-level abstractions - sentences, propositions, and concepts. This contrast raises a central question- Can LMs likewise learn to reason over structured semantic units rather than raw token sequences? In this work, we investigate whether pretrained LMs can be lifted into such abstract reasoning spaces by building on their learned representations. We present a framework that adapts a pretrained token-level LM to operate in sentence space by autoregressively predicting continuous embeddings of next sentences. We explore two embedding paradigms inspired by classical representation learning: 1) semantic embeddings, learned via autoencoding to preserve surface meaning; and 2) contextual embeddings, trained via next-sentence prediction to encode anticipatory structure. We evaluate both under two inference regimes: Discretized, which decodes each predicted embedding into text before re-encoding; and Continuous, which reasons entirely in embedding space for improved efficiency. Across four domains - mathematics, logic, commonsense, and planning - contextual embeddings under continuous inference show competitive performance with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) while reducing inference-time FLOPs on average by half. We also present early signs of scalability and modular adaptation. Finally, to visualize latent trajectories, we introduce SentenceLens, a diagnostic tool that decodes intermediate model states into interpretable sentences. Together, our results indicate that pretrained LMs can effectively transition to abstract, structured reasoning within latent embedding spaces.

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements, drawing significant attention from the research community. Their capabilities are largely attributed to large-scale architectures, which require extensive training on massive datasets. However, such datasets often contain sensitive or copyrighted content sourced from the public internet, raising concerns about data privacy and ownership. Regulatory frameworks, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), grant individuals the right to request the removal of such sensitive information. This has motivated the development of machine unlearning algorithms that aim to remove specific knowledge from models without the need for costly retraining. Despite these advancements, evaluating the efficacy of unlearning algorithms remains a challenge due to the inherent complexity and generative nature of LLMs. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive auditing framework for unlearning evaluation, comprising three benchmark datasets, six unlearning algorithms, and five prompt-based auditing methods. By using various auditing algorithms, we evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of different unlearning strategies. To explore alternatives beyond prompt-based auditing, we propose a novel technique that leverages intermediate activation perturbations, addressing the limitations of auditing methods that rely solely on model inputs and outputs.

Abstract: The application of rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) introduces unique challenges and potential deviations from findings in text-only domains, particularly for perception-heavy tasks. This paper provides a comprehensive study of rule-based visual RL, using jigsaw puzzles as a structured experimental framework. Jigsaw puzzles offer inherent ground truth, adjustable difficulty, and demand complex decision-making, making them ideal for this study. Our research reveals several key findings: \textit{Firstly,} we find that MLLMs, initially performing near to random guessing on the simplest jigsaw puzzles, achieve near-perfect accuracy and generalize to complex, unseen configurations through fine-tuning. \textit{Secondly,} training on jigsaw puzzles can induce generalization to other visual tasks, with effectiveness tied to specific task configurations. \textit{Thirdly,} MLLMs can learn and generalize with or without explicit reasoning, though open-source models often favor direct answering. Consequently, even when trained for step-by-step reasoning, they can ignore the thinking process in deriving the final answer. \textit{Fourthly,} we observe that complex reasoning patterns appear to be pre-existing rather than emergent, with their frequency increasing alongside training and task difficulty. \textit{Finally,} our results demonstrate that RL exhibits more effective generalization than Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and an initial SFT cold start phase can hinder subsequent RL optimization. Although these observations are based on jigsaw puzzles and may vary across other visual tasks, this research contributes a valuable piece of jigsaw to the larger puzzle of collective understanding rule-based visual RL and its potential in multimodal learning.

Abstract: Analog/Mixed-Signal (AMS) circuits play a critical role in the integrated circuit (IC) industry. However, automating Analog/Mixed-Signal (AMS) circuit design has remained a longstanding challenge due to its difficulty and complexity. Although recent advances in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer promising potential for supporting AMS circuit analysis and design, current research typically evaluates MLLMs on isolated tasks within the domain, lacking a comprehensive benchmark that systematically assesses model capabilities across diverse AMS-related challenges. To address this gap, we introduce AMSbench, a benchmark suite designed to evaluate MLLM performance across critical tasks including circuit schematic perception, circuit analysis, and circuit design. AMSbench comprises approximately 8000 test questions spanning multiple difficulty levels and assesses eight prominent models, encompassing both open-source and proprietary solutions such as Qwen 2.5-VL and Gemini 2.5 Pro. Our evaluation highlights significant limitations in current MLLMs, particularly in complex multi-modal reasoning and sophisticated circuit design tasks. These results underscore the necessity of advancing MLLMs' understanding and effective application of circuit-specific knowledge, thereby narrowing the existing performance gap relative to human expertise and moving toward fully automated AMS circuit design workflows. Our data is released at this URL.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in transformer interpretability, an understanding of the computational mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) remains a fundamental challenge. Many approaches interpret a network's hidden representations but remain agnostic about how those representations are generated. We address this by mapping LLM inference for a given input sequence to an equivalent and interpretable linear system which reconstructs the predicted output embedding with relative error below $10^{-13}$ at double floating-point precision, requiring no additional model training. We exploit a property of transformers wherein every operation (gated activations, attention, and normalization) can be expressed as $A(x) \cdot x$, where $A(x)$ represents an input-dependent linear transform and $x$ preserves the linear pathway. To expose this linear structure, we strategically detach components of the gradient computation with respect to an input sequence, freezing the $A(x)$ terms at their values computed during inference, such that the Jacobian yields an equivalent linear mapping. This detached Jacobian of the model reconstructs the output with one linear operator per input token, which is shown for Qwen 3, Gemma 3 and Llama 3, up to Qwen 3 14B. These linear representations demonstrate that LLMs operate in extremely low-dimensional subspaces where the singular vectors can be decoded to interpretable semantic concepts. The computation for each intermediate output also has a linear equivalent, and we examine how the linear representations of individual layers and their attention and multilayer perceptron modules build predictions, and use these as steering operators to insert semantic concepts into unrelated text. Despite their global nonlinearity, LLMs can be interpreted through equivalent linear representations that reveal low-dimensional semantic structures in the next-token prediction process.

Abstract: While recent audio-visual models have demonstrated impressive performance, their robustness to distributional shifts at test-time remains not fully understood. Existing robustness benchmarks mainly focus on single modalities, making them insufficient for thoroughly assessing the robustness of audio-visual models. Motivated by real-world scenarios where shifts can occur $\textit{simultaneously}$ in both audio and visual modalities, we introduce $\texttt{AVROBUSTBENCH}$, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the test-time robustness of audio-visual recognition models. $\texttt{AVROBUSTBENCH}$ comprises four audio-visual benchmark datasets, $\texttt{AUDIOSET-2C}$, $\texttt{VGGSOUND-2C}$, $\texttt{KINETICS-2C}$, and $\texttt{EPICKITCHENS-2C}$, each incorporating 75 bimodal audio-visual corruptions that are $\textit{co-occurring}$ and $\textit{correlated}$. Through extensive evaluations, we observe that state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised audio-visual models exhibit declining robustness as corruption severity increases. Furthermore, online test-time adaptation (TTA) methods, on $\texttt{VGGSOUND-2C}$ and $\texttt{KINETICS-2C}$, offer minimal improvements in performance under bimodal corruptions. We further propose $\texttt{AV2C}$, a simple TTA approach enabling on-the-fly cross-modal fusion by penalizing high-entropy samples, which achieves improvements on $\texttt{VGGSOUND-2C}$. We hope that $\texttt{AVROBUSTBENCH}$ will steer the development of more effective and robust audio-visual TTA approaches. Our code is available $\href{https://github.com/sarthaxxxxx/AV-C-Robustness-Benchmark}{here}$.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models are emerging as powerful tools for long-horizon planning in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly with offline datasets. However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality and diversity of training data. This often restricts their generalization to tasks outside their training distribution or longer planning horizons. To overcome this challenge, we propose State-Covering Trajectory Stitching (SCoTS), a novel reward-free trajectory augmentation method that incrementally stitches together short trajectory segments, systematically generating diverse and extended trajectories. SCoTS first learns a temporal distance-preserving latent representation that captures the underlying temporal structure of the environment, then iteratively stitches trajectory segments guided by directional exploration and novelty to effectively cover and expand this latent space. We demonstrate that SCoTS significantly improves the performance and generalization capabilities of diffusion planners on offline goal-conditioned benchmarks requiring stitching and long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore, augmented trajectories generated by SCoTS significantly improve the performance of widely used offline goal-conditioned RL algorithms across diverse environments.

Abstract: Although audio foundations models have seen great progress on a wide variety of tasks, their application in real-world acoustic environments with reverberation and noise has been less successful. Moreover, as audio foundation models are typically trained on dry, single-channel audio clips, the inherent spatial nature of real-world sound scenes is overlooked and tasks involving sound localization ruled out. To address these limitations, we propose GRAM: a General-purpose Real-world Audio Model utilizing a multi-channel masked auto-encoder approach to efficiently learn spatial audio representations from high-quality simulated real-world scenes. To evaluate the performance of GRAM and other audio foundation models in real-world sound scenes, we release Nat-HEAR: A naturalistic version of the HEAR benchmark suite comprising a simulated real-world version, as well as two new sound localization tasks. We show that the performance of GRAM surpasses all state-of-the-art self-supervised audio foundation models and speech models on both HEAR and Nat-HEAR, while using only a fraction of the training data. GRAM also showcases state-of-the-art localization performance, surpassing even supervised sound localization approaches, and can be flexibly applied either to a two-channel, binaural sound format or a four-channel, Ambisonics format. Validating GRAM's performance on real-world sound recordings demonstrates robust transfer to real-world scenes. Taken together, GRAM presents a significant advancement towards robust, spatial audio foundation models for real-world applications.

Abstract: Graph Edit Distance (GED) is a fundamental graph similarity metric widely used in various applications. However, computing GED is an NP-hard problem. Recent state-of-the-art hybrid GED solver has shown promising performance by formulating GED as a bipartite graph matching problem, then leveraging a generative diffusion model to predict node matching between two graphs, from which both the GED and its corresponding edit path can be extracted using a traditional algorithm. However, such methods typically rely heavily on ground-truth supervision, where the ground-truth node matchings are often costly to obtain in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose GEDRanker, a novel unsupervised GAN-based framework for GED computation. Specifically, GEDRanker consists of a matching-based GED solver and introduces an interpretable preference-aware discriminator. By leveraging preference signals over different node matchings derived from edit path lengths, the discriminator can guide the matching-based solver toward generating high-quality node matching without the need for ground-truth supervision. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our GEDRanker enables the matching-based GED solver to achieve near-optimal solution quality without any ground-truth supervision.

<title>Bridging Neural ODE and ResNet: A Formal Error Bound for Safety Verification</title>

Abstract: A neural ordinary differential equation (neural ODE) is a machine learning model that is commonly described as a continuous-depth generalization of a residual network (ResNet) with a single residual block, or conversely, the ResNet can be seen as the Euler discretization of the neural ODE. These two models are therefore strongly related in a way that the behaviors of either model are considered to be an approximation of the behaviors of the other. In this work, we establish a more formal relationship between these two models by bounding the approximation error between two such related models. The obtained error bound then allows us to use one of the models as a verification proxy for the other, without running the verification tools twice: if the reachable output set expanded by the error bound satisfies a safety property on one of the models, this safety property is then guaranteed to be also satisfied on the other model. This feature is fully reversible, and the initial safety verification can be run indifferently on either of the two models. This novel approach is illustrated on a numerical example of a fixed-point attractor system modeled as a neural ODE.

Abstract: The application of AI in psychiatric diagnosis faces significant challenges, including the subjective nature of mental health assessments, symptom overlap across disorders, and privacy constraints limiting data availability. To address these issues, we present MoodAngels, the first specialized multi-agent framework for mood disorder diagnosis. Our approach combines granular-scale analysis of clinical assessments with a structured verification process, enabling more accurate interpretation of complex psychiatric data. Complementing this framework, we introduce MoodSyn, an open-source dataset of 1,173 synthetic psychiatric cases that preserves clinical validity while ensuring patient privacy. Experimental results demonstrate that MoodAngels outperforms conventional methods, with our baseline agent achieving 12.3% higher accuracy than GPT-4o on real-world cases, and our full multi-agent system delivering further improvements. Evaluation in the MoodSyn dataset demonstrates exceptional fidelity, accurately reproducing both the core statistical patterns and complex relationships present in the original data while maintaining strong utility for machine learning applications. Together, these contributions provide both an advanced diagnostic tool and a critical research resource for computational psychiatry, bridging important gaps in AI-assisted mental health assessment.

Abstract: We introduce AbBiBench (Antibody Binding Benchmarking), a benchmarking framework for antibody binding affinity maturation and design. Unlike previous strategies that evaluate antibodies in isolation, typically by comparing them to natural sequences with metrics such as amino acid recovery rate or structural RMSD, AbBiBench instead treats the antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) complex as the fundamental unit. It evaluates an antibody design's binding potential by measuring how well a protein model scores the full Ab-Ag complex. We first curate, standardize, and share more than 184,500 experimental measurements of antibody mutants across 14 antibodies and 9 antigens-including influenza, lysozyme, HER2, VEGF, integrin, Ang2, and SARS-CoV-2-covering both heavy-chain and light-chain mutations. Using these datasets, we systematically compare 15 protein models including masked language models, autoregressive language models, inverse folding models, diffusion-based generative models, and geometric graph models by comparing the correlation between model likelihood and experimental affinity values. Additionally, to demonstrate AbBiBench's generative utility, we apply it to antibody F045-092 in order to introduce binding to influenza H1N1. We sample new antibody variants with the top-performing models, rank them by the structural integrity and biophysical properties of the Ab-Ag complex, and assess them with in vitro ELISA binding assays. Our findings show that structure-conditioned inverse folding models outperform others in both affinity correlation and generation tasks. Overall, AbBiBench provides a unified, biologically grounded evaluation framework to facilitate the development of more effective, function-aware antibody design models.

Abstract: Pretrained molecular encoders have become indispensable in computational chemistry for tasks such as property prediction and molecular generation. However, the standard practice of relying solely on final-layer embeddings for downstream tasks may discard valuable information. In this work, we first analyze the information flow in five diverse molecular encoders and find that intermediate layers retain more general-purpose features, whereas the final-layer specializes and compresses information. We then perform an empirical layer-wise evaluation across 22 property prediction tasks. We find that using frozen embeddings from optimal intermediate layers improves downstream performance by an average of 5.4%, up to 28.6%, compared to the final-layer. Furthermore, finetuning encoders truncated at intermediate depths achieves even greater average improvements of 8.5%, with increases as high as 40.8%, obtaining new state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks. These findings highlight the importance of exploring the full representational depth of molecular encoders to achieve substantial performance improvements and computational efficiency. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: We introduce Reliable Policy Iteration (RPI) and Conservative RPI (CRPI), variants of Policy Iteration (PI) and Conservative PI (CPI), that retain tabular guarantees under function approximation. RPI uses a novel Bellman-constrained optimization for policy evaluation. We show that RPI restores the textbook \textit{monotonicity} of value estimates and that these estimates provably \textit{lower-bound} the true return; moreover, their limit partially satisfies the \textit{unprojected} Bellman equation. CRPI shares RPI's evaluation, but updates policies conservatively by maximizing a new performance-difference \textit{lower bound} that explicitly accounts for function-approximation-induced errors. CRPI inherits RPI's guarantees and, crucially, admits per-step improvement bounds. In initial simulations, RPI and CRPI outperform PI and its variants. Our work addresses a foundational gap in RL: popular algorithms such as TRPO and PPO derive from tabular CPI yet are deployed with function approximation, where CPI's guarantees often fail-leading to divergence, oscillations, or convergence to suboptimal policies. By restoring PI/CPI-style guarantees for \textit{arbitrary} function classes, RPI and CRPI provide a principled basis for next-generation RL.

Abstract: The proliferation of UAVs has enabled a wide range of mission-critical applications and is becoming a cornerstone of low-altitude networks, supporting smart cities, emergency response, and more. However, the open wireless environment, dynamic topology, and resource constraints of UAVs expose low-altitude networks to severe DoS threats. Traditional defense approaches, which rely on fixed configurations or centralized decision-making, cannot effectively respond to the rapidly changing conditions in UAV swarm environments. To address these challenges, we propose a novel federated multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (FMADRL)-driven moving target defense (MTD) framework for proactive DoS mitigation in low-altitude networks. Specifically, we design lightweight and coordinated MTD mechanisms, including leader switching, route mutation, and frequency hopping, to disrupt attacker efforts and enhance network resilience. The defense problem is formulated as a multi-agent partially observable Markov decision process, capturing the uncertain nature of UAV swarms under attack. Each UAV is equipped with a policy agent that autonomously selects MTD actions based on partial observations and local experiences. By employing a policy gradient-based algorithm, UAVs collaboratively optimize their policies via reward-weighted aggregation. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 34.6% improvement in attack mitigation rate, a reduction in average recovery time of up to 94.6%, and decreases in energy consumption and defense cost by as much as 29.3% and 98.3%, respectively, under various DoS attack strategies. These results highlight the potential of intelligent, distributed defense mechanisms to protect low-altitude networks, paving the way for reliable and scalable low-altitude economy.

Abstract: Prompting large language models (LLMs) to evaluate generated text, known as LLM-as-a-judge, has become a standard evaluation approach in natural language generation (NLG), but is primarily used as a quantitative tool, i.e. with numerical scores as main outputs. In this work, we propose LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge, an LLM-based evaluation approach with the main output being a structured report of common issue types in the NLG system outputs. Our approach is targeted at providing developers with meaningful insights on what improvements can be done to a given NLG system and consists of two main steps, namely open-ended per-instance issue analysis and clustering of the discovered issues using an intuitive cumulative algorithm. We also introduce a strategy for evaluating the proposed approach, coupled with ~300 annotations of issues in instances from 12 NLG datasets. Our results show that instance-specific issues output by LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge match those annotated by humans in 2/3 cases, and that LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge is capable of producing error type reports resembling the reports composed by human annotators. We also demonstrate in a case study how the use of LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge can substantially improve NLG systems performance. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/tunde-ajayi/llm-as-a-qualitative-judge.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance across multimodal tasks by integrating visual perception with language understanding. However, how vision information contributes to the model's decoding process remains under-explored, as reflected in frequent hallucinations. Through a series of analyses, we found that (i) vision tokens provide meaningful visual information even when hallucinations occur, and (ii) their semantics are encoded in the textual space and become explicit under appropriate vocabulary constraints. Building on these observations, we propose ReVisiT, a simple training-free decoding method that references vision tokens to guide text generation. Our approach leverages the semantic information embedded within vision tokens by projecting them into the text token distribution. Specifically, ReVisiT dynamically selects the most relevant vision token at each decoding step via context-aware constrained divergence minimization, and using its constrained projection to refine the output distribution to better incorporate visual semantics. Across five benchmarks on recent LVLMs, ReVisiT consistently enhances visual grounding with minimal computational overhead, and achieves competitive or superior results to state-of-the-art decoding baselines while reducing computational cost by up to $2\times$.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise as zero-shot goal-conditioned value functions, but their frozen pre-trained representations limit generalization and temporal reasoning. We introduce VITA, a zero-shot value function learning method that enhances both capabilities via test-time adaptation. At inference, a lightweight adaptation module is updated via a gradient step on a meta-learned self-supervised loss, such that each test-time update improves value estimation. By updating sequentially over a trajectory, VITA encodes history into its parameters, addressing the temporal reasoning limitations. To mitigate shortcut learning, we propose a dissimilarity-based sampling strategy that selects semantically diverse segments of the trajectory during training. In real-world robotic manipulation tasks, VITA generalizes from a single training environment to diverse out-of-distribution tasks, environments, and embodiments, outperforming the state-of-the-art zero-shot method using autoregressive VLMs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that VITA's zero-shot value estimates can be utilized for reward shaping in offline reinforcement learning, resulting in multi-task policies on the Meta-World benchmark that exceed the performance of those trained with the simulation's fuzzy-logic dense rewards.

<title>Tversky Neural Networks: Psychologically Plausible Deep Learning with Differentiable Tversky Similarity</title>

Abstract: Work in psychology has highlighted that the geometric model of similarity standard in deep learning is not psychologically plausible because its metric properties such as symmetry do not align with human perception of similarity. In contrast, Tversky (1977) proposed an axiomatic theory of similarity with psychological plausibility based on a representation of objects as sets of features, and their similarity as a function of their common and distinctive features. This model of similarity has not been used in deep learning before, in part because of the challenge of incorporating discrete set operations. In this paper, we develop a differentiable parameterization of Tversky's similarity that is learnable through gradient descent, and derive basic neural network building blocks such as the Tversky projection layer, which unlike the linear projection layer can model non-linear functions such as XOR. Through experiments with image recognition and language modeling neural networks, we show that the Tversky projection layer is a beneficial replacement for the linear projection layer. For instance, on the NABirds image classification task, a frozen ResNet-50 adapted with a Tversky projection layer achieves a 24.7% relative accuracy improvement over the linear layer adapter baseline. With Tversky projection layers, GPT-2's perplexity on PTB decreases by 7.8%, and its parameter count by 34.8%. Finally, we propose a unified interpretation of both types of projection layers as computing similarities of input stimuli to learned prototypes for which we also propose a novel visualization technique highlighting the interpretability of Tversky projection layers. Our work offers a new paradigm for thinking about the similarity model implicit in modern deep learning, and designing neural networks that are interpretable under an established theory of psychological similarity.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) is an essential emergent ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), and recent studies introduce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to exemplars of ICL to enhance the reasoning capability, especially in mathematics tasks. However, given the continuous advancement of model capabilities, it remains unclear whether CoT exemplars still benefit recent, stronger models in such tasks. Through systematic experiments, we find that for recent strong models such as the Qwen2.5 series, adding traditional CoT exemplars does not improve reasoning performance compared to Zero-Shot CoT. Instead, their primary function is to align the output format with human expectations. We further investigate the effectiveness of enhanced CoT exemplars, constructed using answers from advanced models such as \texttt{Qwen2.5-Max} and \texttt{DeepSeek-R1}. Experimental results indicate that these enhanced exemplars still fail to improve the model's reasoning performance. Further analysis reveals that models tend to ignore the exemplars and focus primarily on the instructions, leading to no observable gain in reasoning ability. Overall, our findings highlight the limitations of the current ICL+CoT framework in mathematical reasoning, calling for a re-examination of the ICL paradigm and the definition of exemplars.

<title>StreetLens: Enabling Human-Centered AI Agents for Neighborhood Assessment from Street View Imagery</title>

Abstract: Traditionally, neighborhood studies have used interviews, surveys, and manual image annotation guided by detailed protocols to identify environmental characteristics, including physical disorder, decay, street safety, and sociocultural symbols, and to examine their impact on developmental and health outcomes. Although these methods yield rich insights, they are time-consuming and require intensive expert intervention. Recent technological advances, including vision language models (VLMs), have begun to automate parts of this process; however, existing efforts are often ad hoc and lack adaptability across research designs and geographic contexts. In this paper, we present StreetLens, a user-configurable human-centered workflow that integrates relevant social science expertise into a VLM for scalable neighborhood environmental assessments. StreetLens mimics the process of trained human coders by focusing the analysis on questions derived from established interview protocols, retrieving relevant street view imagery (SVI), and generating a wide spectrum of semantic annotations from objective features (e.g., the number of cars) to subjective perceptions (e.g., the sense of disorder in an image). By enabling researchers to define the VLM's role through domain-informed prompting, StreetLens places domain knowledge at the core of the analysis process. It also supports the integration of prior survey data to enhance robustness and expand the range of characteristics assessed in diverse settings. StreetLens represents a shift toward flexible and agentic AI systems that work closely with researchers to accelerate and scale neighborhood studies. StreetLens is publicly available at https://knowledge-computing.github.io/projects/streetlens.

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is a cornerstone defense, but many variants overlook foundational feature representations by primarily focusing on stronger attack generation. We introduce Adversarial Evolution Training (AET), a simple yet powerful framework that strategically prepends an Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) phase to conventional AT. We hypothesize this initial ERM phase cultivates a favorable feature manifold, enabling more efficient and effective robustness acquisition. Empirically, AET achieves comparable or superior robustness more rapidly, improves clean accuracy, and cuts training costs by 8-25\%. Its effectiveness is shown across multiple datasets, architectures, and when augmenting established AT methods. Our findings underscore the impact of feature pre-conditioning via standard training for developing more efficient, principled robust defenses. Code is available in the supplementary material.

Abstract: Large language models with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures achieve efficiency and scalability, yet their routing mechanisms introduce safety alignment challenges insufficiently addressed by techniques developed for dense models. In this work, the MoE-specific safety risk of positional vulnerability-that safety-aligned behaviors rely on specific expert modules-is formalized and systematically analyzed. An analytical framework, SAFEx, is presented to robustly identify, characterize, and validate safety-critical experts via a stability-based expert selection procedure, and to decompose them into two functional groups: the Harmful Content Detection Group (HCDG), which specializes in identifying and recognizing harmful content within user inputs, and the Harmful Response Control Group (HRCG), which specializes in controlling and enforcing model behaviors to generate appropriate safety responses. Expert-level interventions are conducted to probe causality and to test mitigation. Targeted masking of SAFEx-selected experts reveals that safety behavior is highly concentrated. On Qwen3-30B-A3B, configured with 48 MoE-FFN layers and 128 experts per layer under top-8 routing (48x128=6,144 experts in total), disabling 12 selected experts reduces the refusal rate by 22%. In addition, lightweight adaptation is performed using LoRA under three configurations-the HRCG, the union of HCDG and HRCG, and all experts-and the resulting updates are composed through negative weight merging targeted at the HRCG, leading to improved refusal under adversarial prompts without full-model retraining. These results establish positional vulnerability as a distinct MoE-specific safety challenge and provide a practical, compute-efficient pathway for expert-level safety interventions within routed architectures.

Abstract: Understanding and modeling nonlinear dynamical systems is a fundamental challenge across science and engineering. Deep learning has shown remarkable potential for capturing complex system behavior, yet achieving models that are both accurate and physically interpretable remains difficult. To address this, we propose Structured Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural ODEs (SKANODEs), a framework that integrates structured state-space modeling with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). Within a Neural ODE architecture, SKANODE employs a fully trainable KAN as a universal function approximator to perform virtual sensing, recovering latent states that correspond to interpretable physical quantities such as displacements and velocities. Leveraging KAN's symbolic regression capability, SKANODE then extracts compact, interpretable expressions for the system's governing dynamics. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world systems demonstrate that SKANODE achieves superior predictive accuracy, discovers physics-consistent dynamics, and reveals complex nonlinear behavior. Notably, it identifies hysteretic behavior in an F-16 aircraft and recovers a concise symbolic equation describing this phenomenon. SKANODE thus enables interpretable, data-driven discovery of physically grounded models for complex nonlinear dynamical systems.

<title>On Convolutions, Intrinsic Dimension, and Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: The manifold hypothesis asserts that data of interest in high-dimensional ambient spaces, such as image data, lies on unknown low-dimensional submanifolds. Diffusion models (DMs) -- which operate by convolving data with progressively larger amounts of Gaussian noise and then learning to revert this process -- have risen to prominence as the most performant generative models, and are known to be able to learn distributions with low-dimensional support. For a given datum in one of these submanifolds, we should thus intuitively expect DMs to have implicitly learned its corresponding local intrinsic dimension (LID), i.e. the dimension of the submanifold it belongs to. Kamkari et al. (2024b) recently showed that this is indeed the case by linking this LID to the rate of change of the log marginal densities of the DM with respect to the amount of added noise, resulting in an LID estimator known as FLIPD. LID estimators such as FLIPD have a plethora of uses, among others they quantify the complexity of a given datum, and can be used to detect outliers, adversarial examples and AI-generated text. FLIPD achieves state-of-the-art performance at LID estimation, yet its theoretical underpinnings are incomplete since Kamkari et al. (2024b) only proved its correctness under the highly unrealistic assumption of affine submanifolds. In this work we bridge this gap by formally proving the correctness of FLIPD under realistic assumptions. Additionally, we show that an analogous result holds when Gaussian convolutions are replaced with uniform ones, and discuss the relevance of this result.

Abstract: Extracting molecular structure-activity relationships (SARs) from scientific literature and patents is essential for drug discovery and materials research. However, this task remains challenging due to heterogeneous document formats and limitations of existing methods. Specifically, rule-based approaches relying on rigid templates fail to generalize across diverse document layouts, while general-purpose multimodal large language models (MLLMs) lack sufficient accuracy and reliability for specialized tasks, such as layout detection and optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR). To address these challenges, we introduce DocSAR-200, a rigorously annotated benchmark of 200 scientific documents designed specifically for evaluating SAR extraction methods. Additionally, we propose Doc2SAR, a novel synergistic framework that integrates domain-specific tools with MLLMs enhanced via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Extensive experiments demonstrate that Doc2SAR achieves state-of-the-art performance across various document types, significantly outperforming leading end-to-end baselines. Specifically, Doc2SAR attains an overall Table Recall of 80.78% on DocSAR-200, exceeding end2end GPT-4o by 51.48%. Furthermore, Doc2SAR demonstrates practical usability through efficient inference and is accompanied by a web app.

Abstract: Bed-related falls remain a major source of injury in hospitals and long-term care facilities, yet many commercial alarms trigger only after a patient has already left the bed. We show that early bed-exit intent can be predicted using only one low-cost load cell mounted under a bed leg. The resulting load signals are first converted into a compact set of complementary images: an RGB line plot that preserves raw waveforms and three texture maps-recurrence plot, Markov transition field, and Gramian angular field-that expose higher-order dynamics. We introduce ViFusionTST, a dual-stream Swin Transformer that processes the line plot and texture maps in parallel and fuses them through cross-attention to learn data-driven modality weights. To provide a realistic benchmark, we collected six months of continuous data from 95 beds in a long-term-care facility. On this real-world dataset ViFusionTST reaches an accuracy of 0.885 and an F1 score of 0.794, surpassing recent 1D and 2D time-series baselines across F1, recall, accuracy, and AUPRC. The results demonstrate that image-based fusion of load-sensor signals for time series classification is a practical and effective solution for real-time, privacy-preserving fall prevention.

Abstract: Alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values has recently garnered significant attention, with prominent examples including the canonical yet costly Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and the simple Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In this work, we demonstrate that both RLHF and DPO can be interpreted from the perspective of mutual information (MI) maximization, uncovering a profound connection to contrastive learning. Within this framework, both RLHF and DPO can be interpreted as methods that performing contrastive learning based on the positive and negative samples derived from base model, leveraging the Donsker-Varadhan (DV) lower bound on MI (equivalently, the MINE estimator). Such paradigm further illuminates why RLHF may not intrinsically incentivize reasoning capacities in LLMs beyond what is already present in the base model. Building on the perspective, we replace the DV/MINE bound with the Jensen-Shannon (JS) MI estimator and propose the Mutual Information Optimization (MIO). Comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that MIO mitigates the late-stage decline in chosen-likelihood observed in DPO, achieving competitive or superior performance across various challenging reasoning and mathematical benchmarks.

Abstract: Self-improvement is among the most prominent techniques within the realm of large language models (LLM), aiming to enhance the LLM performance without relying on external data. Despite its significance, generally how LLM performances evolve during the self-improvement process remains underexplored. In this paper, we theoretically model the training dynamics of self-improvement via the concept of solver-verifier gap. This is inspired by the conjecture that the performance enhancement of self-improvement stems from the gap between LLM's solver capability and verifier capability. Based on the theoretical framework, we further show how to model the entire training trajectory. This framework allows quantifying the capability limit of self-improvement by fitting the theoretical model to the experiment results. We empirically validate the effectiveness of the theoretical framework on various LLMs and datasets. Beyond self-improvement, we extend our analysis to investigate how external data influences these dynamics within the framework. Notably, we find that under limited external data regimes, such external data can be utilized at any stage without significantly affecting final performances, which accords with the empirical observations.

Abstract: In recent years, unlearning techniques, which are methods for inducing a model to "forget" previously learned information, have attracted attention as a way to address privacy and copyright concerns in large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs). While several unlearning benchmarks have been established for LLMs, a practical evaluation framework for unlearning in LMMs has been less explored. Specifically, existing unlearning benchmark for LMMs considers only scenarios in which the model is required to unlearn fine-tuned knowledge through a single unlearning operation. In this study, we introduce PULSE protocol for realistic unlearning scenarios for LMMs by introducing two critical perspectives: (i) Pre-trained knowledge Unlearning for analyzing the effect across different knowledge acquisition phases and (ii) Long-term Sustainability Evaluation to address sequential requests. We then evaluate existing unlearning methods along these dimensions. Our results reveal that, although some techniques can successfully unlearn knowledge acquired through fine-tuning, they struggle to eliminate information learned during pre-training. Moreover, methods that effectively unlearn a batch of target data in a single operation exhibit substantial performance degradation when the same data are split and unlearned sequentially.

Abstract: Gradients of neural networks encode valuable information for optimization, editing, and analysis of models. Therefore, practitioners often treat gradients as inputs to task-specific algorithms, e.g. for pruning or optimization. Recent works explore learning algorithms that operate directly on gradients but use architectures that are not specifically designed for gradient processing, limiting their applicability. In this paper, we present a principled approach for designing architectures that process gradients. Our approach is guided by three principles: (1) equivariant design that preserves neuron permutation symmetries, (2) processing sets of gradients across multiple data points to capture curvature information, and (3) efficient gradient representation through rank-1 decomposition. Based on these principles, we introduce GradMetaNet, a novel architecture for learning on gradients, constructed from simple equivariant blocks. We prove universality results for GradMetaNet, and show that previous approaches cannot approximate natural gradient-based functions that GradMetaNet can. We then demonstrate GradMetaNet's effectiveness on a diverse set of gradient-based tasks on MLPs and transformers, such as learned optimization, INR editing, and estimating loss landscape curvature.

Abstract: Choosing appropriate fabrics is critical for meeting functional and quality demands in robotic textile manufacturing, apparel production, and smart retail. We propose MLLM-Fabric, a robotic framework leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for fabric sorting and selection. Built on a multimodal robotic platform, the system is trained through supervised fine-tuning and explanation-guided distillation to rank fabric properties. We also release a dataset of 220 diverse fabrics, each with RGB images and synchronized visuotactile and pressure data. Experiments show that our Fabric-Llama-90B consistently outperforms pretrained vision-language baselines in both attribute ranking and selection reliability. Code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/limanwang/MLLM-Fabric.

<title>Train-before-Test Harmonizes Language Model Rankings</title>

Abstract: Existing language model benchmarks provide contradictory model rankings, even for benchmarks that aim to capture similar skills. This dilemma of conflicting rankings hampers model selection, clouds model comparisons, and adds confusion to a growing ecosystem of competing models. In this paper, we take a different perspective on model comparison: instead of relying on out-of-the-box performance via direct evaluation, we compare model potential by providing each model with identical benchmark-specific fine-tuning before evaluation. We call this approach train-before-test. Our primary contribution is a comprehensive empirical evaluation of model potential across 24 benchmarks and 61 models. First, we demonstrate that model potential rankings obtained through train-before-test exhibit remarkable consistency across all benchmarks. Whereas traditional rankings demonstrate little external validity under direct evaluation, they enjoy a significant degree of external validity when applying train-before-test: model potential rankings transfer gracefully from one benchmark to another. Second, train-before-test restores the connection between perplexity and downstream task performance, lost under direct evaluation. Remarkably, even pre-finetuning perplexity of a base model predicts post-finetuning downstream performance, suggesting that ranking consistency reflects inherent model potential rather than fine-tuning artifacts. Finally, train-before-test reduces the model-score matrix to essentially rank one, indicating that model potential is dominated by one latent factor, uncovered by train-before-test. Our work supports the recommendation to make train-before-test a default component of LLM benchmarking.

Abstract: Turbulent fluid flows are among the most computationally demanding problems in science, requiring enormous computational resources that become prohibitive at high flow speeds. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a radically different approach that trains neural networks directly from physical equations rather than data, offering the potential for continuous, mesh-free solutions. Here we show that appropriately designed PINNs can successfully simulate fully turbulent flows in both two and three dimensions, directly learning solutions to the fundamental fluid equations without traditional computational grids or training data. Our approach combines several algorithmic innovations including adaptive network architectures, causal training, and advanced optimization methods to overcome the inherent challenges of learning chaotic dynamics. Through rigorous validation on challenging turbulence problems, we demonstrate that PINNs accurately reproduce key flow statistics including energy spectra, kinetic energy, enstrophy, and Reynolds stresses. Our results demonstrate that neural equation solvers can handle complex chaotic systems, opening new possibilities for continuous turbulence modeling that transcends traditional computational limitations.

Abstract: Diffusion models can be improved with additional guidance towards more effective representations of input. Indeed, prior empirical work has already shown that aligning internal representations of the diffusion model with those of pre-trained models improves generation quality. In this paper, we present a systematic framework for incorporating representation guidance into diffusion models. We provide alternative decompositions of denoising models along with their associated training criteria, where the decompositions determine when and how the auxiliary representations are incorporated. Guided by our theoretical insights, we introduce two new strategies for enhancing representation alignment in diffusion models. First, we pair examples with target representations either derived from themselves or arisen from different synthetic modalities, and subsequently learn a joint model over the multimodal pairs. Second, we design an optimal training curriculum that balances representation learning and data generation. Our experiments across image, protein sequence, and molecule generation tasks demonstrate superior performance as well as accelerated training. In particular, on the class-conditional ImageNet $256\times 256$ benchmark, our guidance results in $23.3$ times faster training than the original SiT-XL as well as four times speedup over the state-of-the-art method REPA.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold considerable promise for applications in healthcare. However, their deployment in safety-critical settings is hindered by two key limitations: (i) sensitivity to prompt design, and (ii) a tendency to generate incorrect responses with high confidence. As clinicians may rely on a model's stated confidence to gauge the reliability of its predictions, it is especially important that when a model expresses high confidence, it is also highly accurate. We introduce Prompt4Trust, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework for prompt augmentation targeting confidence calibration in MLLMs. A lightweight LLM is trained to produce context-aware auxiliary prompts that guide a downstream task MLLM to generate responses in which the expressed confidence more accurately reflects predictive accuracy. Unlike conventional calibration techniques, Prompt4Trust specifically prioritizes aspects of calibration most critical for safe and trustworthy clinical decision-making. Beyond improvements driven by this clinically motivated calibration objective, our proposed method also improves task accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art medical visual question answering (VQA) performance on the PMC-VQA benchmark, which is composed of multiple-choice questions spanning diverse medical imaging modalities. Moreover, our framework trained with a small downstream task MLLM showed promising zero-shot generalization to larger MLLMs in our experiments, suggesting the potential for scalable calibration without the associated computational costs. This work demonstrates the potential of automated yet human-aligned prompt engineering for improving the the trustworthiness of MLLMs in safety critical settings.

Abstract: As a primary medium for modern information dissemination, social networking services (SNS) have experienced rapid growth, which has proposed significant challenges for platform content management and interaction quality improvement. Recently, the development of large language models (LLMs) has offered potential solutions but existing studies focus on isolated tasks, which not only encounter diminishing benefit from the data scaling within individual scenarios but also fail to flexibly adapt to diverse real-world context. To address these challenges, we introduce RedOne, a domain-specific LLM designed to break the performance bottleneck of single-task baselines and establish a comprehensive foundation for the SNS. RedOne was developed through a three-stage training strategy consisting of continue pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and preference optimization, using a large-scale real-world dataset. Through extensive experiments, RedOne maintains strong general capabilities, and achieves an average improvement up to 14.02% across 8 major SNS tasks and 7.56% in SNS bilingual evaluation benchmark, compared with base models. Furthermore, through online testing, RedOne reduced the exposure rate in harmful content detection by 11.23% and improved the click page rate in post-view search by 14.95% compared with single-tasks finetuned baseline models. These results establish RedOne as a robust domain-specific LLM for SNS, demonstrating excellent generalization across various tasks and promising applicability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Objectives: Timely and accurate detection of colorectal polyps plays a crucial role in diagnosing and preventing colorectal cancer, a major cause of mortality worldwide. This study introduces a new, lightweight, and efficient framework for polyp detection that combines the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm for filtering noisy data with the YOLO-v11n deep learning model.
  Study design: An experimental study leveraging deep learning and outlier removal techniques across multiple public datasets.
  Methods: The proposed approach was tested on five diverse and publicly available datasets: CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, ETIS, and EndoScene. Since these datasets originally lacked bounding box annotations, we converted their segmentation masks into suitable detection labels. To enhance the robustness and generalizability of our model, we apply 5-fold cross-validation and remove anomalous samples using the LOF method configured with 30 neighbors and a contamination ratio of 5%. Cleaned data are then fed into YOLO-v11n, a fast and resource-efficient object detection architecture optimized for real-time applications. We train the model using a combination of modern augmentation strategies to improve detection accuracy under diverse conditions.
  Results: Our approach significantly improves polyp localization performance, achieving a precision of 95.83%, recall of 91.85%, F1-score of 93.48%, mAP@0.5 of 96.48%, and mAP@0.5:0.95 of 77.75%. Compared to previous YOLO-based methods, our model demonstrates enhanced accuracy and efficiency.
  Conclusions: These results suggest that the proposed method is well-suited for real-time colonoscopy support in clinical settings. Overall, the study underscores how crucial data preprocessing and model efficiency are when designing effective AI systems for medical imaging.

<title>Learning Representations of Event Time Series with Sparse Autoencoders for Anomaly Detection, Similarity Search, and Unsupervised Classification</title>

Abstract: Event time series are sequences of discrete events occurring at irregular time intervals, each associated with a domain-specific observational modality. They are common in domains such as high-energy astrophysics, computational social science, cybersecurity, finance, healthcare, neuroscience, and seismology. Their unstructured and irregular structure poses significant challenges for extracting meaningful patterns and identifying salient phenomena using conventional techniques. We propose novel two- and three-dimensional tensor representations for event time series, coupled with sparse autoencoders that learn physically meaningful latent representations. These embeddings support a variety of downstream tasks, including anomaly detection, similarity-based retrieval, semantic clustering, and unsupervised classification. We demonstrate our approach on a real-world dataset from X-ray astronomy, showing that these representations successfully capture temporal and spectral signatures and isolate diverse classes of X-ray transients. Our framework offers a flexible, scalable, and generalizable solution for analyzing complex, irregular event time series across scientific and industrial domains.

Abstract: The pursuit of a generalizable stereo matching model, capable of performing well across varying resolutions and disparity ranges without dataset-specific fine-tuning, has revealed a fundamental trade-off. Iterative local search methods achieve high scores on constrained benchmarks, but their core mechanism inherently limits the global consistency required for true generalization. However, global matching architectures, while theoretically more robust, have historically been rendered infeasible by prohibitive computational and memory costs. We resolve this dilemma with {S\textsuperscript{2}M\textsuperscript{2}}: a global matching architecture that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and high efficiency without relying on cost volume filtering or deep refinement stacks. Our design integrates a multi-resolution transformer for robust long-range correspondence, trained with a novel loss function that concentrates probability on feasible matches. This approach enables a more robust joint estimation of disparity, occlusion, and confidence. {S\textsuperscript{2}M\textsuperscript{2}} establishes a new state of the art on Middlebury v3 and ETH3D benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior methods in most metrics while reconstructing high-quality details with competitive efficiency.

Abstract: We investigate the extent to which Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) trained with Surrogate Gradient Descent (Surrogate GD), with and without delay learning, can learn from precise spike timing beyond firing rates. We first design synthetic tasks isolating intra-neuron inter-spike intervals and cross-neuron synchrony under matched spike counts. On more complex spike-based speech recognition datasets (Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) and Spiking Speech Commands (SSC), we construct variants where spike count information is eliminated and only timing information remains, and show that Surrogate GD-trained SNNs are able to perform significantly above chance whereas purely rate-based models perform at chance level. We further evaluate robustness under biologically inspired perturbations -- including Gaussian jitter per spike or per-neuron, and spike deletion -- revealing consistent but perturbation-specific degradation. Networks show a sharp performance drop when spike sequences are reversed in time, with a larger drop in performance from SNNs trained with delays, indicating that these networks are more human-like in terms of behaviour. To facilitate further studies of temporal coding, we have released our modified SHD and SSC datasets.

Abstract: Adapter parameters provide a mechanism to modify the behavior of machine learning models and have gained significant popularity in the context of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI. These parameters can be merged to support multiple tasks via a process known as task merging. However, prior work on merging in LLMs, particularly in natural language processing, has been limited to scenarios where each test example addresses only a single task. In this paper, we focus on on-device settings and study the problem of text-based compositional multi-tasking, where each test example involves the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks. For instance, generating a translated summary of a long text requires solving both translation and summarization tasks concurrently. To facilitate research in this setting, we propose a benchmark comprising four practically relevant compositional tasks. We also present an efficient method (Learnable Calibration) tailored for on-device applications, where computational resources are limited, emphasizing the need for solutions that are both resource-efficient and high-performing. Our contributions lay the groundwork for advancing the capabilities of LLMs in real-world multi-tasking scenarios, expanding their applicability to complex, resource-constrained use cases.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must react in milliseconds while reasoning about road geometry and traffic intent to navigate complex situations. We introduce NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from 2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.

Abstract: Autonomous cars need geometric accuracy and semantic understanding to navigate complex environments, yet most stacks handle them separately. We present XYZ-Drive, a single vision-language model that reads a front-camera frame, a 25m $\times$ 25m overhead map, and the next waypoint, then outputs steering and speed. A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model. On the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark XYZ-Drive attains 95% success and 0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality (vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion injects map knowledge more effectively. Keeping the transformer frozen loses 5%, showing the importance of fine-tuning when applying VLMs for specific tasks such as autonomous driving. Coarsening map resolution from 10 cm to 40 cm blurs lane edges and raises crash rate. Overall, these results demonstrate that early, token-level fusion of intent and map layout enables accurate, transparent, real-time driving.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making in radiology increasingly benefits from artificial intelligence (AI), particularly through large language models (LLMs). However, traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for radiology question answering (QA) typically rely on single-step retrieval, limiting their ability to handle complex clinical reasoning tasks. Here we propose radiology Retrieval and Reasoning (RaR), a multi-step retrieval and reasoning framework designed to improve diagnostic accuracy, factual consistency, and clinical reliability of LLMs in radiology question answering. We evaluated 25 LLMs spanning diverse architectures, parameter scales (0.5B to >670B), and training paradigms (general-purpose, reasoning-optimized, clinically fine-tuned), using 104 expert-curated radiology questions from previously established RSNA-RadioQA and ExtendedQA datasets. To assess generalizability, we additionally tested on an unseen internal dataset of 65 real-world radiology board examination questions. RaR significantly improved mean diagnostic accuracy over zero-shot prompting and conventional online RAG. The greatest gains occurred in small-scale models, while very large models (>200B parameters) demonstrated minimal changes (<2% improvement). Additionally, RaR retrieval reduced hallucinations (mean 9.4%) and retrieved clinically relevant context in 46% of cases, substantially aiding factual grounding. Even clinically fine-tuned models showed gains from RaR (e.g., MedGemma-27B), indicating that retrieval remains beneficial despite embedded domain knowledge. These results highlight the potential of RaR to enhance factuality and diagnostic accuracy in radiology QA, warranting future studies to validate their clinical utility. All datasets, code, and the full RaR framework are publicly available to support open research and clinical translation.

Abstract: We study the problem of posterior sampling in the context of score based generative models. We have a trained score network for a prior $p(x)$, a measurement model $p(y|x)$, and are tasked with sampling from the posterior $p(x|y)$. Prior work has shown this to be intractable in KL (in the worst case) under well-accepted computational hardness assumptions. Despite this, popular algorithms for tasks such as image super-resolution, stylization, and reconstruction enjoy empirical success. Rather than establishing distributional assumptions or restricted settings under which exact posterior sampling is tractable, we view this as a more general "tilting" problem of biasing a distribution towards a measurement. Under minimal assumptions, we show that one can tractably sample from a distribution that is simultaneously close to the posterior of a noised prior in KL divergence and the true posterior in Fisher divergence. Intuitively, this combination ensures that the resulting sample is consistent with both the measurement and the prior. To the best of our knowledge these are the first formal results for (approximate) posterior sampling in polynomial time.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong performance across multimodal tasks. However, they often produce hallucinations -- text that is inconsistent with visual input, due to the limited ability to verify information in different regions of the image. To address this, we propose Multi-Region Fusion Decoding (MRFD), a training-free decoding method that improves factual grounding by modeling inter-region consistency. MRFD identifies salient regions using cross-attention, generates initial responses for each, and computes reliability weights based on Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) among the responses. These weights guide a consistency-aware fusion of per-region predictions, using region-aware prompts inspired by Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Experiments across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that MRFD significantly reduces hallucinations and improves response factuality without requiring model updates.

Abstract: Defending backdoor attacks in Federated Learning (FL) under heterogeneous client data distributions encounters limitations balancing effectiveness and privacy-preserving, while most existing methods highly rely on the assumption of homogeneous client data distributions or the availability of a clean serve dataset. In this paper, we propose an FL backdoor defense framework, named CLIP-Fed, that utilizes the zero-shot learning capabilities of vision-language pre-training models. Our scheme overcomes the limitations of Non-IID imposed on defense effectiveness by integrating pre-aggregation and post-aggregation defense strategies. CLIP-Fed aligns the knowledge of the global model and CLIP on the augmented dataset using prototype contrastive loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence, so that class prototype deviations caused by backdoor samples are ensured and the correlation between trigger patterns and target labels is eliminated. In order to balance privacy-preserving and coverage enhancement of the dataset against diverse triggers, we further construct and augment the server dataset via using the multimodal large language model and frequency analysis without any client samples. Extensive experiments on representative datasets evidence the effectiveness of CLIP-Fed. Comparing to other existing methods, CLIP-Fed achieves an average reduction in Attack Success Rate, {\em i.e.}, 2.03\% on CIFAR-10 and 1.35\% on CIFAR-10-LT, while improving average Main Task Accuracy by 7.92\% and 0.48\%, respectively. Our codes are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CLIP-Fed.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving from text generators into reasoning agents. This transition makes their ability to use external tools a critical capability. However, evaluating this skill presents a significant challenge. Existing benchmarks are often limited by their reliance on synthetic tools and severely constrained action spaces. To address these limitations, we introduce MCPVerse, an expansive, real-world benchmark for evaluating agentic tool use. MCPVerse integrates more than 550 real-world, executable tools to create an unprecedented action space exceeding 140k tokens, and employs outcome-based evaluation with real-time ground truth for time-sensitive tasks. We benchmarked the state-of-the-art LLMs across three modes (Oracle, Standard, and Max-Scale), revealing that while most models suffer performance degradation when confronted with larger tool sets, the agentic models, such as Claude-4-Sonnet, can effectively leverage expanded exploration spaces to improve accuracy. This finding not only exposes the limitations of state-of-the-art models in complex, real-world scenarios but also establishes MCPVerse as a critical benchmark for measuring and advancing agentic tool use capabilities.

Abstract: Climate change is amplifying extreme events, posing escalating risks to biodiversity, human health, and food security. GCMs are essential for projecting future climate, yet their coarse resolution and high computational costs constrain their ability to represent extremes. Here, we introduce FuXi-CMIPAlign, a generative deep learning framework for downscaling CMIP outputs. The model integrates Flow Matching for generative modeling with domain adaptation via MMD loss to align feature distributions between training data and inference data, thereby mitigating input discrepancies and improving accuracy, stability, and generalization across emission scenarios. FuXi-CMIPAlign performs spatial, temporal, and multivariate downscaling, enabling more realistic simulation of compound extremes such as TCs.

Abstract: Autonomous UAV inspection of confined industrial infrastructure, such as ventilation ducts, demands robust navigation policies where collisions are unacceptable. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a powerful paradigm for developing such policies, it presents a critical trade-off between on-policy and off-policy algorithms. Off-policy methods promise high sample efficiency, a vital trait for minimizing costly and unsafe real-world fine-tuning. In contrast, on-policy methods often exhibit greater training stability, which is essential for reliable convergence in hazard-dense environments. This paper directly investigates this trade-off by comparing a leading on-policy algorithm, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), against an off-policy counterpart, Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), for precision flight in procedurally generated ducts within a high-fidelity simulator. Our results show that PPO consistently learned a stable, collision-free policy that completed the entire course. In contrast, SAC failed to find a complete solution, converging to a suboptimal policy that navigated only the initial segments before failure. This work provides evidence that for high-precision, safety-critical navigation tasks, the reliable convergence of a well-established on-policy method can be more decisive than the nominal sample efficiency of an off-policy algorithm.

Abstract: This paper presents a deep learning framework designed to enhance the grasping capabilities of quadrupeds equipped with arms, with a focus on improving precision and adaptability. Our approach centers on a sim-to-real methodology that minimizes reliance on physical data collection. We developed a pipeline within the Genesis simulation environment to generate a synthetic dataset of grasp attempts on common objects. By simulating thousands of interactions from various perspectives, we created pixel-wise annotated grasp-quality maps to serve as the ground truth for our model. This dataset was used to train a custom CNN with a U-Net-like architecture that processes multi-modal input from an onboard RGB and depth cameras, including RGB images, depth maps, segmentation masks, and surface normal maps. The trained model outputs a grasp-quality heatmap to identify the optimal grasp point. We validated the complete framework on a four-legged robot. The system successfully executed a full loco-manipulation task: autonomously navigating to a target object, perceiving it with its sensors, predicting the optimal grasp pose using our model, and performing a precise grasp. This work proves that leveraging simulated training with advanced sensing offers a scalable and effective solution for object handling.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of data scarcity and high acquisition costs in training robust object detection models for complex industrial environments, such as offshore oil platforms. Data collection in these hazardous settings often limits the development of autonomous inspection systems. To mitigate this issue, we propose a hybrid data synthesis pipeline that integrates procedural rendering and AI-driven video generation. The approach uses BlenderProc to produce photorealistic images with domain randomization and NVIDIA's Cosmos-Predict2 to generate physically consistent video sequences with temporal variation. A YOLO-based detector trained on a composite dataset, combining real and synthetic data, outperformed models trained solely on real images. A 1:1 ratio between real and synthetic samples achieved the highest accuracy. The results demonstrate that synthetic data generation is a viable, cost-effective, and safe strategy for developing reliable perception systems in safety-critical and resource-constrained industrial applications.

Abstract: The effectiveness of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) prompting is often limited by the use of randomly or manually selected examples. These examples fail to account for both model-specific knowledge distributions and the intrinsic complexity of the tasks, resulting in suboptimal and unstable model performance. To address this, we propose a novel framework inspired by the pedagogical principle of "tailored teaching with balanced difficulty". We reframe prompt selection as a prompt curriculum design problem: constructing a well ordered set of training examples that align with the model's current capabilities. Our approach integrates two complementary signals: (1) model-perceived difficulty, quantified through prediction disagreement in an active learning setup, capturing what the model itself finds challenging; and (2) intrinsic sample complexity, which measures the inherent difficulty of each question-image pair independently of any model. By jointly analyzing these signals, we develop a difficulty-balanced sampling strategy that ensures the selected prompt examples are diverse across both dimensions. Extensive experiments conducted on five challenging benchmarks and multiple popular Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate that our method yields substantial and consistent improvements and greatly reduces performance discrepancies caused by random sampling, providing a principled and robust approach for enhancing multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models process visual inputs independently at each timestep, discarding valuable temporal information inherent in robotic manipulation tasks. This frame-by-frame processing makes models vulnerable to visual noise while ignoring the substantial coherence between consecutive frames in manipulation sequences. We propose Temporal Token Fusion (TTF), a training-free approach that intelligently integrates historical and current visual representations to enhance VLA inference quality. Our method employs dual-dimension detection combining efficient grayscale pixel difference analysis with attention-based semantic relevance assessment, enabling selective temporal token fusion through hard fusion strategies and keyframe anchoring to prevent error accumulation. Comprehensive experiments across LIBERO, SimplerEnv, and real robot tasks demonstrate consistent improvements: 4.0 percentage points average on LIBERO (72.4\% vs 68.4\% baseline), cross-environment validation on SimplerEnv (4.8\% relative improvement), and 8.7\% relative improvement on real robot tasks. Our approach proves model-agnostic, working across OpenVLA and VLA-Cache architectures. Notably, TTF reveals that selective Query matrix reuse in attention mechanisms enhances rather than compromises performance, suggesting promising directions for direct KQV matrix reuse strategies that achieve computational acceleration while improving task success rates.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are artificial neural networks based on simulated biological neurons and have attracted much attention in recent artificial intelligence technology studies. The dendrites in biological neurons have efficient information processing ability and computational power; however, the neurons of SNNs rarely match the complex structure of the dendrites. Inspired by the nonlinear structure and highly sparse properties of neuronal dendrites, in this study, we propose an efficient, lightweight SNN method with nonlinear pruning and dendritic integration (NSPDI-SNN). In this method, we introduce nonlinear dendritic integration (NDI) to improve the representation of the spatiotemporal information of neurons. We implement heterogeneous state transition ratios of dendritic spines and construct a new and flexible nonlinear synaptic pruning (NSP) method to achieve the high sparsity of SNN. We conducted systematic experiments on three benchmark datasets (DVS128 Gesture, CIFAR10-DVS, and CIFAR10) and extended the evaluation to two complex tasks (speech recognition and reinforcement learning-based maze navigation task). Across all tasks, NSPDI-SNN consistently achieved high sparsity with minimal performance degradation. In particular, our method achieved the best experimental results on all three event stream datasets. Further analysis showed that NSPDI significantly improved the efficiency of synaptic information transfer as sparsity increased. In conclusion, our results indicate that the complex structure and nonlinear computation of neuronal dendrites provide a promising approach for developing efficient SNN methods.

Abstract: This report investigates approaches for prompting a tool-augmented large language model (LLM) to act as a role-playing dialogue agent in the API track of the Commonsense Persona-grounded Dialogue Challenge (CPDC) 2025. In this setting, dialogue agents often produce overly long in-character responses (over-speaking) while failing to use tools effectively according to the persona (under-acting), such as generating function calls that do not exist or making unnecessary tool calls before answering. We explore four prompting approaches to address these issues: 1) basic role prompting, 2) improved role prompting, 3) automatic prompt optimization (APO), and 4) rule-based role prompting. The rule-based role prompting (RRP) approach achieved the best performance through two novel techniques-character-card/scene-contract design and strict enforcement of function calling-which led to an overall score of 0.571, improving on the zero-shot baseline score of 0.519. These findings demonstrate that RRP design can substantially improve the effectiveness and reliability of role-playing dialogue agents compared with more elaborate methods such as APO. To support future efforts in developing persona prompts, we are open-sourcing all of our best-performing prompts and the APO tool Source code is available at https://github.com/scb-10x/apo

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in leveraging extensive external knowledge to enhance responses in multi-turn and agentic applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during re-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those in standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most computations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG, an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve latency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we demonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to previous work) without loss in perplexity. In addition, our optimization framework for large context enables REFRAG to extend the context size of LLMs by 16. We provide rigorous validation of REFRAG across diverse long-context tasks, including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document summarization, spanning a wide range of datasets. Experimental results confirm that REFRAG delivers substantial speedup with no loss in accuracy compared to LLaMA models and other state-of-the-art baselines across various context sizes.

Abstract: This paper introduces DrDiff, a novel framework for long-text generation that overcomes the efficiency-quality trade-off through three core technologies. First, we design a dynamic expert scheduling mechanism that intelligently allocates computational resources during the diffusion process based on text complexity, enabling more efficient handling of text generation tasks of varying difficulty. Second, we introduce a Hierarchical Sparse Attention (HSA) mechanism that adaptively adjusts attention patterns according to a variety of input lengths, reducing computational complexity from O($n^2$) to O($n$) while maintaining model performance. Finally, we propose a soft absorption guidance optimization strategy that combines with DPM-solver++ to reduce diffusion steps, significantly improving generation speed. Comprehensive experiments on various long-text generation benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our DrDiff over the existing SOTA methods.

Abstract: In self-supervised reinforcement learning (RL), one of the key challenges is learning a diverse set of skills to prepare agents for unknown future tasks. Despite impressive advances, scalability and evaluation remain prevalent issues. Regarding scalability, the search for meaningful skills can be obscured by high-dimensional feature spaces, where relevant features may vary across downstream task domains. For evaluating skill diversity, defining what constitutes "diversity" typically requires a hard commitment to a specific notion of what it means for skills to be diverse, potentially leading to inconsistencies in how skill diversity is understood, making results across different approaches hard to compare, and leaving many forms of diversity unexplored. To address these issues, we adopt a measure of sample diversity that translates ideas from ecology to machine learning -- the Vendi Score -- allowing the user to specify and evaluate any desired form of diversity. We demonstrate how this metric facilitates skill evaluation and introduce VendiRL, a unified framework for learning diversely diverse sets of skills. Given distinct similarity functions, VendiRL motivates distinct forms of diversity, which could support skill-diversity pretraining in new and richly interactive environments where optimising for various forms of diversity may be desirable.

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements of self-play fine-tuning (SPIN), which can transform a weak large language model (LLM) into a strong one through competitive interactions between models of varying capabilities, it still faces challenges in the Text-to-SQL task. SPIN does not generate new information, and the large number of correct SQL queries produced by the opponent model during self-play reduces the main model's ability to generate accurate SQL queries. To address this challenge, we propose a new self-play fine-tuning method tailored for the Text-to-SQL task, called SPFT-SQL. Prior to self-play, we introduce a verification-based iterative fine-tuning approach, which synthesizes high-quality fine-tuning data iteratively based on the database schema and validation feedback to enhance model performance, while building a model base with varying capabilities. During the self-play fine-tuning phase, we propose an error-driven loss method that incentivizes incorrect outputs from the opponent model, enabling the main model to distinguish between correct SQL and erroneous SQL generated by the opponent model, thereby improving its ability to generate correct SQL. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses on six open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Abstract: While multi-agent debate has been proposed as a promising strategy for improving AI reasoning ability, we find that debate can sometimes be harmful rather than helpful. Prior work has primarily focused on debates within homogeneous groups of agents, whereas we explore how diversity in model capabilities influences the dynamics and outcomes of multi-agent interactions. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that debate can lead to a decrease in accuracy over time - even in settings where stronger (i.e., more capable) models outnumber their weaker counterparts. Our analysis reveals that models frequently shift from correct to incorrect answers in response to peer reasoning, favoring agreement over challenging flawed reasoning. We perform additional experiments investigating various potential contributing factors to these harmful shifts - including sycophancy, social conformity, and model and task type. These results highlight important failure modes in the exchange of reasons during multi-agent debate, suggesting that naive applications of debate may cause performance degradation when agents are neither incentivised nor adequately equipped to resist persuasive but incorrect reasoning.

Abstract: Modeling long-range interactions, the propagation of information across distant parts of a graph, is a central challenge in graph machine learning. Graph wavelets, inspired by multi-resolution signal processing, provide a principled way to capture both local and global structures. However, existing wavelet-based graph neural networks rely on finite-order polynomial approximations, which limit their receptive fields and hinder long-range propagation. We propose Long-Range Graph Wavelet Networks (LR-GWN), which decompose wavelet filters into complementary local and global components. Local aggregation is handled with efficient low-order polynomials, while long-range interactions are captured through a flexible spectral-domain parameterization. This hybrid design unifies short- and long-distance information flow within a principled wavelet framework. Experiments show that LR-GWN achieves state-of-the-art performance among wavelet-based methods on long-range benchmarks, while remaining competitive on short-range datasets.

Abstract: We propose VL Norm (Variance-reduced Length-dependent Normalization), a simple yet effective loss aggregation method tailored to the characteristic of dynamic generation lengths in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Recently, RLVR has demonstrated strong potential in improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but a major challenge lies in the large variability of response lengths during training, which leads to high gradient variance and unstable optimization. Although previous methods such as GRPO, DAPO, and Dr. GRPO introduce different loss normalization terms to address this issue, they either produce biased estimates or still suffer from high gradient variance. By analyzing the effect of varying lengths on policy loss both theoretically and empirically, we reformulate the problem as finding a minimum-variance unbiased estimator. Our proposed VL Norm not only provides an unbiased estimate of the true policy loss but also minimizes gradient variance in theory. Besides, VL Norm is easy to implement with less than 10 lines of code change. Extensive experiments show that it consistently achieves superior results across different model sizes, maximum lengths, and tasks. When integrated into the state-of-the-art RL algorithm DAPO, it achieves up to 2.67x faster convergence on the CountDown task. Our code is public at https://github.com/zerolllin/Delta-L-Normalization.

Abstract: We propose FSPO (Fair Sequence Policy Optimization), a sequence-level reinforcement learning method for LLMs that enforces length-fair clipping on the importance-sampling (IS) weight. We study RL methods with sequence-level IS and identify a mismatch when PPO/GRPO-style clipping is transplanted to sequences: a fixed clip range systematically reweights short vs. long responses, distorting the optimization direction. FSPO introduces a simple remedy: we clip the sequence log-IS ratio with a band that scales as $\sqrt{L}$. Theoretically, we formalize length fairness via a Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and prove that small LRE yields a cosine directional guarantee between the clipped and true updates. Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins, stabilizes training, and outperforms baselines across model sizes and evaluation datasets, with the largest gains on the Qwen3-8B-Base model.

Abstract: Smart contracts automate the management of high-value assets, where vulnerabilities can lead to catastrophic financial losses. This challenge is amplified in Large Language Models (LLMs) by two interconnected failures: they operate as unauditable "black boxes" lacking a transparent reasoning process, and consequently, generate code riddled with critical security vulnerabilities. To address both issues, we propose SmartCoder-R1 (based on Qwen2.5-Coder-7B), a novel framework for secure and explainable smart contract generation. It begins with Continual Pre-training (CPT) to specialize the model. We then apply Long Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-Tuning (L-CoT SFT) on 7,998 expert-validated reasoning-and-code samples to train the model to emulate human security analysis. Finally, to directly mitigate vulnerabilities, we employ Security-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO), a reinforcement learning phase that refines the generation policy by optimizing a weighted reward signal for compilation success, security compliance, and format correctness. Evaluated against 17 baselines on a benchmark of 756 real-world functions, SmartCoder-R1 establishes a new state of the art, achieving top performance across five key metrics: a ComPass of 87.70%, a VulRate of 8.60%, a SafeAval of 80.16%, a FuncRate of 53.84%, and a FullRate of 50.53%. This FullRate marks a 45.79% relative improvement over the strongest baseline, DeepSeek-R1. Crucially, its generated reasoning also excels in human evaluations, achieving high-quality ratings for Functionality (82.7%), Security (85.3%), and Clarity (90.7%).

Abstract: This paper presents ASTREA, the first agentic system executed on flight-heritage hardware (TRL 9) for autonomous spacecraft operations, with on-orbit operation aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Using thermal control as a representative use case, we integrate a resource-constrained Large Language Model (LLM) agent with a reinforcement learning controller in an asynchronous architecture tailored for space-qualified platforms. Ground experiments show that LLM-guided supervision improves thermal stability and reduces violations, confirming the feasibility of combining semantic reasoning with adaptive control under hardware constraints. On-orbit validation aboard the ISS initially faced challenges due to inference latency misaligned with the rapid thermal cycles of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. Synchronization with the orbit length successfully surpassed the baseline with reduced violations, extended episode durations, and improved CPU utilization. These findings demonstrate the potential for scalable agentic supervision architectures in future autonomous spacecraft.

Abstract: Adapting billion-parameter language models to a downstream task is still costly, even with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We re-cast task adaptation as output-distribution alignment: the objective is to steer the output distribution toward the task distribution directly during decoding rather than indirectly through weight updates. Building on this view, we introduce Steering Vector Decoding (SVDecode), a lightweight, PEFT-compatible, and theoretically grounded method. We start with a short warm-start fine-tune and extract a task-aware steering vector from the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence gradient between the output distribution of the warm-started and pre-trained models. This steering vector is then used to guide the decoding process to steer the model's output distribution towards the task distribution. We theoretically prove that SVDecode is first-order equivalent to the gradient step of full fine-tuning and derive a globally optimal solution for the strength of the steering vector. Across three tasks and nine benchmarks, SVDecode paired with four standard PEFT methods improves multiple-choice accuracy by up to 5 percentage points and open-ended truthfulness by 2 percentage points, with similar gains (1-2 percentage points) on commonsense datasets without adding trainable parameters beyond the PEFT adapter. SVDecode thus offers a lightweight, theoretically grounded path to stronger task adaptation for large language models.

Abstract: The reliability of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in open-world settings depends heavily on their ability to flag out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs unseen during training. Recent advances in large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled promising few-shot OOD detection frameworks using only a handful of in-distribution (ID) samples. However, existing prompt learning-based OOD methods rely solely on softmax probabilities, overlooking the rich discriminative potential of the feature embeddings learned by VLMs trained on millions of samples. To address this limitation, we propose a novel context optimization (CoOp)-based framework that integrates subspace representation learning with prompt tuning. Our approach improves ID-OOD separability by projecting the ID features into a subspace spanned by prompt vectors, while projecting ID-irrelevant features into an orthogonal null space. To train such OOD detection framework, we design an easy-to-handle end-to-end learning criterion that ensures strong OOD detection performance as well as high ID classification accuracy.

Abstract: This paper investigates part-of-speech tagging, an important task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for the Nagamese language. The Nagamese language, a.k.a. Naga Pidgin, is an Assamese-lexified Creole language developed primarily as a means of communication in trade between the Nagas and people from Assam in northeast India. A substantial amount of work in part-of-speech-tagging has been done for resource-rich languages like English, Hindi, etc. However, no work has been done in the Nagamese language. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at part-of-speech tagging for the Nagamese Language. The aim of this work is to identify the part-of-speech for a given sentence in the Nagamese language. An annotated corpus of 16,112 tokens is created and applied machine learning technique known as Conditional Random Fields (CRF). Using CRF, an overall tagging accuracy of 85.70%; precision, recall of 86%, and f1-score of 85% is achieved.
  Keywords. Nagamese, NLP, part-of-speech, machine learning, CRF.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In long-term and multi-turn agent tasks, existing approaches driven solely by outcome rewards often suffer from the problem of sparse supervision. To address the challenge, we propose Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (Tree-GRPO), a grouped agent RL method based on tree search, where each tree node represents the complete agent interaction step. By sharing common prefixes, the tree search sampling increases the number of rollouts achievable within a fixed budget of tokens or tool calls. Moreover, we find that the tree-structured trajectory naturally allows the construction of step-wise process supervised signals even using only the outcome reward. Based on this, Tree-GRPO estimates the grouped relative advantages both on intra-tree and inter-tree levels. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the objective of intra-tree level group relative policy optimization is equivalent to that of step-level direct preference learning. Experiments across 11 datasets and 3 types of QA tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed tree-based RL over the chain-based RL method.

Abstract: Unsupervised analysis of text corpora is challenging, especially in data-scarce domains where traditional topic models struggle. While these models offer a solution, they typically describe clusters with lists of keywords that require significant manual effort to interpret and often lack semantic coherence. To address this critical interpretability gap, we introduce Recursive Thematic Partitioning (RTP), a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to interactively build a binary tree. Each node in the tree is a natural language question that semantically partitions the data, resulting in a fully interpretable taxonomy where the logic of each cluster is explicit. Our experiments demonstrate that RTP's question-driven hierarchy is more interpretable than the keyword-based topics from a strong baseline like BERTopic. Furthermore, we establish the quantitative utility of these clusters by showing they serve as powerful features in downstream classification tasks, particularly when the data's underlying themes correlate with the task labels. RTP introduces a new paradigm for data exploration, shifting the focus from statistical pattern discovery to knowledge-driven thematic analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the thematic paths from the RTP tree can serve as structured, controllable prompts for generative models. This transforms our analytical framework into a powerful tool for synthesis, enabling the consistent imitation of specific characteristics discovered in the source corpus.

Abstract: Quantum generative models based on instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuits show great promise in learning complex distributions while maintaining classical trainability. However, current implementations suffer from two key limitations: lack of controllability over generated outputs and severe generation bias towards certain expected patterns. We present a Controllable Quantum Generative Framework, ConQuER, which addresses both challenges through a modular circuit architecture. ConQuER embeds a lightweight controller circuit that can be directly combined with pre-trained IQP circuits to precisely control the output distribution without full retraining. Leveraging the advantages of IQP, our scheme enables precise control over properties such as the Hamming Weight distribution with minimal parameter and gate overhead. In addition, inspired by the controller design, we extend this modular approach through data-driven optimization to embed implicit control paths in the underlying IQP architecture, significantly reducing generation bias on structured datasets. ConQuER retains efficient classical training properties and high scalability. We experimentally validate ConQuER on multiple quantum state datasets, demonstrating its superior control accuracy and balanced generation performance, only with very low overhead cost over original IQP circuits. Our framework bridges the gap between the advantages of quantum computing and the practical needs of controllable generation modeling.

Abstract: We propose Graph Consistency Regularization (GCR), a novel framework that injects relational graph structures, derived from model predictions, into the learning process to promote class-aware, semantically meaningful feature representations. Functioning as a form of self-prompting, GCR enables the model to refine its internal structure using its own outputs. While deep networks learn rich representations, these often capture noisy inter-class similarities that contradict the model's predicted semantics. GCR addresses this issue by introducing parameter-free Graph Consistency Layers (GCLs) at arbitrary depths. Each GCL builds a batch-level feature similarity graph and aligns it with a global, class-aware masked prediction graph, derived by modulating softmax prediction similarities with intra-class indicators. This alignment enforces that feature-level relationships reflect class-consistent prediction behavior, acting as a semantic regularizer throughout the network. Unlike prior work, GCR introduces a multi-layer, cross-space graph alignment mechanism with adaptive weighting, where layer importance is learned from graph discrepancy magnitudes. This allows the model to prioritize semantically reliable layers and suppress noisy ones, enhancing feature quality without modifying the architecture or training procedure. GCR is model-agnostic, lightweight, and improves semantic structure across various networks and datasets. Experiments show that GCR promotes cleaner feature structure, stronger intra-class cohesion, and improved generalization, offering a new perspective on learning from prediction structure.

Abstract: Effectively integrating diverse sensory modalities is crucial for robotic manipulation. However, the typical approach of feature concatenation is often suboptimal: dominant modalities such as vision can overwhelm sparse but critical signals like touch in contact-rich tasks, and monolithic architectures cannot flexibly incorporate new or missing modalities without retraining. Our method factorizes the policy into a set of diffusion models, each specialized for a single representation (e.g., vision or touch), and employs a router network that learns consensus weights to adaptively combine their contributions, enabling incremental of new representations. We evaluate our approach on simulated manipulation tasks in {RLBench}, as well as real-world tasks such as occluded object picking, in-hand spoon reorientation, and puzzle insertion, where it significantly outperforms feature-concatenation baselines on scenarios requiring multimodal reasoning. Our policy further demonstrates robustness to physical perturbations and sensor corruption. We further conduct perturbation-based importance analysis, which reveals adaptive shifts between modalities.

<title>Knowledge-Level Consistency Reinforcement Learning: Dual-Fact Alignment for Long-Form Factuality</title>

Abstract: Hallucination and factuality deficits remain key obstacles to the reliability of large language models (LLMs) in long-form generation. Existing reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) frameworks primarily rely on preference rewards, yet they often overlook the model's internal knowledge boundaries, exacerbating the so-called "hallucination tax". To address this challenge, we propose Knowledge-Level Consistency Reinforcement Learning Framework (KLCF), a novel framework that focuses on the knowledge consistency between the policy model's expressed knowledge and the base model's parametric knowledge, and introduces a Dual-Fact Alignment mechanism to jointly optimize factual recall and precision. Specifically, KLCF leverages pretrained knowledge boundaries to construct fact checklist, guiding online reinforcement learning to improve factual coverage and recall; simultaneously, it trains a self-assessment module based on the base model's internal knowledge to enhance factual precision during generation. Unlike prior methods that rely on external retrieval or heavy verification, our reward design is fully external-knowledge-free and lightweight, making KLCF efficient and easily scalable to large-scale training. Experimental results demonstrate that KLCF substantially improves factuality metrics across multiple long-form benchmarks and effectively alleviates model hallucinations.

Abstract: Unit testing is essential for software quality assurance, yet writing and maintaining tests remains time-consuming and error-prone. To address this challenge, researchers have proposed various techniques for automating unit test generation, including traditional heuristic-based methods and more recent approaches that leverage large language models (LLMs). However, these existing approaches are inherently path-insensitive because they rely on fixed heuristics or limited contextual information and fail to reason about deep control-flow structures. As a result, they often struggle to achieve adequate coverage, particularly for deep or complex execution paths. In this work, we present a path-sensitive framework, JUnitGenie, to fill this gap by combining code knowledge with the semantic capabilities of LLMs in guiding context-aware unit test generation. After extracting code knowledge from Java projects, JUnitGenie distills this knowledge into structured prompts to guide the generation of high-coverage unit tests. We evaluate JUnitGenie on 2,258 complex focal methods from ten real-world Java projects. The results show that JUnitGenie generates valid tests and improves branch and line coverage by 29.60% and 31.00% on average over both heuristic and LLM-based baselines. We further demonstrate that the generated test cases can uncover real-world bugs, which were later confirmed and fixed by developers.

Abstract: Prominent AI companies are producing 'safety frameworks' as a type of voluntary self-governance. These statements purport to establish risk thresholds and safety procedures for the development and deployment of highly capable AI. Understanding which AI risks are covered and what actions are allowed, refused, demanded, encouraged, or discouraged by these statements is vital for assessing how these frameworks actually govern AI development and deployment. We draw on affordance theory to analyse the OpenAI 'Preparedness Framework Version 2' (April 2025) using the Mechanisms & Conditions model of affordances and the MIT AI Risk Repository. We find that this safety policy requests evaluation of a small minority of AI risks, encourages deployment of systems with 'Medium' capabilities for unintentionally enabling 'severe harm' (which OpenAI defines as >1000 deaths or >$100B in damages), and allows OpenAI's CEO to deploy even more dangerous capabilities. These findings suggest that effective mitigation of AI risks requires more robust governance interventions beyond current industry self-regulation. Our affordance analysis provides a replicable method for evaluating what safety frameworks actually permit versus what they claim.

Abstract: Diverse human motion generation is an increasingly important task, having various applications in computer vision, human-computer interaction and animation. While text-to-motion synthesis using diffusion models has shown success in generating high-quality motions, achieving fine-grained expressive motion control remains a significant challenge. This is due to the lack of motion style diversity in datasets and the difficulty of expressing quantitative characteristics in natural language. Laban movement analysis has been widely used by dance experts to express the details of motion including motion quality as consistent as possible. Inspired by that, this work aims for interpretable and expressive control of human motion generation by seamlessly integrating the quantification methods of Laban Effort and Shape components into the text-guided motion generation models. Our proposed zero-shot, inference-time optimization method guides the motion generation model to have desired Laban Effort and Shape components without any additional motion data by updating the text embedding of pretrained diffusion models during the sampling step. We demonstrate that our approach yields diverse expressive motion qualities while preserving motion identity by successfully manipulating motion attributes according to target Laban tags.

Abstract: Recent empirical studies have explored the idea of continuing to train a model at test-time for a given task, known as test-time training (TTT), and have found it to yield significant performance improvements. However, there is limited understanding of why and when TTT is effective. Earlier explanations mostly focused on the observation that TTT may help when applied to out-of-distribution adaptation or used with privileged data. However, the growing scale of foundation models with most test data being in-distribution questions these explanations. We instead posit that foundation models remain globally underparameterized, with TTT providing a mechanism for specialization after generalization, focusing capacity on concepts relevant to the test task. Specifically, under the linear representation hypothesis, we propose a model in which TTT achieves a substantially smaller in-distribution test error than global training. We empirically validate our model's key assumptions by training a sparse autoencoder on ImageNet, showing that semantically related data points are explained by only a few shared concepts. Finally, we perform scaling studies across image and language tasks that confirm the practical implications of our model, identifying the regimes where specialization is most effective.

Abstract: We introduce SANA-Video, a small diffusion model that can efficiently generate videos up to 720x1280 resolution and minute-length duration. SANA-Video synthesizes high-resolution, high-quality and long videos with strong text-video alignment at a remarkably fast speed, deployable on RTX 5090 GPU. Two core designs ensure our efficient, effective and long video generation: (1) Linear DiT: We leverage linear attention as the core operation, which is more efficient than vanilla attention given the large number of tokens processed in video generation. (2) Constant-Memory KV cache for Block Linear Attention: we design block-wise autoregressive approach for long video generation by employing a constant-memory state, derived from the cumulative properties of linear attention. This KV cache provides the Linear DiT with global context at a fixed memory cost, eliminating the need for a traditional KV cache and enabling efficient, minute-long video generation. In addition, we explore effective data filters and model training strategies, narrowing the training cost to 12 days on 64 H100 GPUs, which is only 1% of the cost of MovieGen. Given its low cost, SANA-Video achieves competitive performance compared to modern state-of-the-art small diffusion models (e.g., Wan 2.1-1.3B and SkyReel-V2-1.3B) while being 16x faster in measured latency. Moreover, SANA-Video can be deployed on RTX 5090 GPUs with NVFP4 precision, accelerating the inference speed of generating a 5-second 720p video from 71s to 29s (2.4x speedup). In summary, SANA-Video enables low-cost, high-quality video generation.

Abstract: With the growing popularity of LLM agents and RAG, it has become increasingly important to retrieve documents that are essential for solving a task, even when their connection to the task is indirect or implicit. Addressing this problem requires fine-grained reasoning to accurately assess the relevance between the task and each candidate document. This capability, however, poses a significant challenge for existing IR techniques. Despite recent progress in reasoning-enhanced IR, existing approaches still face significant challenges in applicability, scalability, and efficiency. In this work, we propose Retro*, a novel approach for reasoning-intensive document retrieval. Our method introduces a rubric-based relevance scoring mechanism, enabling the model to reason about the relationship between a task and a document based on explicitly defined criteria, whereby producing a fine-grained, interpretable relevance score. Retro* also supports test-time scaling by combining multiple reasoning trajectories via score integration, which produces more reliable relevance estimates. To optimize Retro*'s reasoning capabilities, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for its relevance scoring mechanism, which employs two composite rewards to fully exploit the trajectories of each training sample. Our experiments show that Retro* outperforms existing document retrieval methods with notable advantages, leading to state-of-the-art performance on the BRIGHT benchmark.

<title>How Effective Are Time-Series Models for Rainfall Nowcasting? A Comprehensive Benchmark for Rainfall Nowcasting Incorporating PWV Data</title>

Abstract: Rainfall nowcasting, which aims to predict precipitation within the next 0 to 3 hours, is critical for disaster mitigation and real-time response planning. However, most time series forecasting benchmarks in meteorology are evaluated on variables with strong periodicity, such as temperature and humidity, which fail to reflect model capabilities in more complex and practically meteorology scenarios like rainfall nowcasting. To address this gap, we propose RainfallBench, a benchmark designed for rainfall nowcasting, a highly challenging and practically relevant task characterized by zero inflation, temporal decay, and non-stationarity, focused on predicting precipitation within the next 0 to 3 hours. The dataset is derived from five years of meteorological observations, recorded at 15-minute intervals across six essential variables, and collected from more than 12,000 GNSS stations globally. In particular, it incorporates precipitable water vapor (PWV), a crucial indicator of rainfall that is absent in other datasets. We further design specialized evaluation strategies to assess model performance on key meteorological challenges, such as multi-scale prediction and extreme rainfall events, and evaluate over 20 state-of-the-art models across six major architectures on RainfallBench. Additionally, to address the zero-inflation and temporal decay issues overlooked by existing models, we introduce Bi-Focus Precipitation Forecaster (BFPF), a plug-and-play module that incorporates domain-specific priors to enhance rainfall time series forecasting. Statistical analysis and ablation studies validate the comprehensiveness of our dataset as well as the superiority of our methodology. Code and datasets are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RainfallBench-A710.

Abstract: Large language models excel with reinforcement learning (RL), but fully unlocking this potential requires a mid-training stage. An effective mid-training phase should identify a compact set of useful actions and enable fast selection among them through online RL. We formalize this intuition by presenting the first theoretical result on how mid-training shapes post-training: it characterizes an action subspace that minimizes both the value approximation error from pruning and the RL error during subsequent planning. Our analysis reveals two key determinants of mid-training effectiveness: pruning efficiency, which shapes the prior of the initial RL policy, and its impact on RL convergence, which governs the extent to which that policy can be improved via online interactions. These results suggest that mid-training is most effective when the decision space is compact and the effective horizon is short, highlighting the importance of operating in the space of action abstractions rather than primitive actions. Building on these insights, we propose Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3), a scalable mid-training algorithm. Specifically, we derive a sequential variational lower bound and optimize it by iteratively discovering temporally-consistent latent structures via RL, followed by fine-tuning on the bootstrapped data. Experiments on code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Across multiple base models, RA3 improves the average performance on HumanEval and MBPP by 8 and 4 points over the base model and the next-token prediction baseline. Furthermore, RA3 achieves faster convergence and higher asymptotic performance in RLVR on HumanEval+, MBPP+, LiveCodeBench, and Codeforces.

Abstract: Effective analysis of cybersecurity and threat intelligence data demands language models that can interpret specialized terminology, complex document structures, and the interdependence of natural language and source code. Encoder-only transformer architectures provide efficient and robust representations that support critical tasks such as semantic search, technical entity extraction, and semantic analysis, which are key to automated threat detection, incident triage, and vulnerability assessment. However, general-purpose language models often lack the domain-specific adaptation required for high precision. We present SecureBERT 2.0, an enhanced encoder-only language model purpose-built for cybersecurity applications. Leveraging the ModernBERT architecture, SecureBERT 2.0 introduces improved long-context modeling and hierarchical encoding, enabling effective processing of extended and heterogeneous documents, including threat reports and source code artifacts. Pretrained on a domain-specific corpus more than thirteen times larger than its predecessor, comprising over 13 billion text tokens and 53 million code tokens from diverse real-world sources, SecureBERT 2.0 achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple cybersecurity benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in semantic search for threat intelligence, semantic analysis, cybersecurity-specific named entity recognition, and automated vulnerability detection in code within the cybersecurity domain.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in embodied agents creates an urgent need to measure their privacy awareness in the physical world. Existing evaluation methods, however, are confined to natural language based scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce EAPrivacy, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark designed to quantify the physical-world privacy awareness of LLM-powered agents. EAPrivacy utilizes procedurally generated scenarios across four tiers to test an agent's ability to handle sensitive objects, adapt to changing environments, balance task execution with privacy constraints, and resolve conflicts with social norms. Our measurements reveal a critical deficit in current models. The top-performing model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, achieved only 59\% accuracy in scenarios involving changing physical environments. Furthermore, when a task was accompanied by a privacy request, models prioritized completion over the constraint in up to 86\% of cases. In high-stakes situations pitting privacy against critical social norms, leading models like GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-haiku disregarded the social norm over 15\% of the time. These findings, demonstrated by our benchmark, underscore a fundamental misalignment in LLMs regarding physically grounded privacy and establish the need for more robust, physically-aware alignment.

Abstract: We present a self-supervised machine learning framework for detecting and mapping harmful algal bloom (HAB) severity and speciation using multi-sensor satellite data. By fusing reflectance data from operational instruments (VIIRS, MODIS, Sentinel-3, PACE) with TROPOMI solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), our framework, called SIT-FUSE, generates HAB severity and speciation products without requiring per-instrument labeled datasets. The framework employs self-supervised representation learning, hierarchical deep clustering to segment phytoplankton concentrations and speciations into interpretable classes, validated against in-situ data from the Gulf of Mexico and Southern California (2018-2025). Results show strong agreement with total phytoplankton, Karenia brevis, Alexandrium spp., and Pseudo-nitzschia spp. measurements. This work advances scalable HAB monitoring in label-scarce environments while enabling exploratory analysis via hierarchical embeddings: a critical step toward operationalizing self-supervised learning for global aquatic biogeochemistry.

Abstract: The reconstruction of visual information from brain activity fosters interdisciplinary integration between neuroscience and computer vision. However, existing methods still face challenges in accurately recovering highly complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from the characteristics of natural scenes: low-level features exhibit heterogeneity, while high-level features show semantic entanglement due to contextual overlaps. Inspired by the hierarchical representation theory of the visual cortex, we propose the HAVIR model, which separates the visual cortex into two hierarchical regions and extracts distinct features from each. Specifically, the Structural Generator extracts structural information from spatial processing voxels and converts it into latent diffusion priors, while the Semantic Extractor converts semantic processing voxels into CLIP embeddings. These components are integrated via the Versatile Diffusion model to synthesize the final image. Experimental results demonstrate that HAVIR enhances both the structural and semantic quality of reconstructions, even in complex scenes, and outperforms existing models.

<title>PDE-Transformer: A Continuous Dynamical Systems Approach to Sequence Modeling</title>

Abstract: We propose PDE-Transformer, a novel sequence modeling paradigm that casts the forward pass of a Transformer as the numerical discretization of a continuous reaction-diffusion system derived from a variational energy functional. In our framework, token embeddings evolve under a partial differential equation whose nonlocal integral term models self-attention, local reaction term models feed-forward layers, diffusion term encodes positional smoothing, and a stability control term corresponds to layer normalization. From this unifying perspective, we design an Adaptive PDE Diffusion Layer-an efficient, learnable finite-difference stencil that enforces local smoothness in feature space with linear time complexity and complements self-attention's global routing. Through a systematic theoretical analysis based on four pillars:stability, diffusion geometry, multi-scale dynamics, and component coupling, we derive principled guidelines for integrating the PDE layer at seven candidate points in the Transformer. Empirically, on the Long Range Arena benchmark, placing the layer immediately after embedding yields a 4.1 pp average accuracy gain over a strong baseline, and an adaptive multi-scale variant delivers further improvements. Our work thus offers a principled, lightweight mechanism to bolster long-range dependency modeling by harmonizing continuous PDE smoothing with discrete self-attention.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated impressive performance in generating high-fidelity images, largely enabled by text-guided inference. However, this advantage often comes with a critical drawback: limited diversity, as outputs tend to collapse into similar modes under strong text guidance. Existing approaches typically optimize intermediate latents or text conditions during inference, but these methods deliver only modest gains or remain sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Noise Optimization, a simple yet effective method that addresses the diversity issue from a distinct perspective. Unlike prior techniques that adapt intermediate latents, our approach shapes the initial noise to promote diverse outputs. Specifically, we develop a contrastive loss defined in the Tweedie data space and optimize a batch of noise latents. Our contrastive optimization repels instances within the batch to maximize diversity while keeping them anchored to a reference sample to preserve fidelity. We further provide theoretical insights into the mechanism of this preprocessing to substantiate its effectiveness. Extensive experiments across multiple T2I backbones demonstrate that our approach achieves a superior quality-diversity Pareto frontier while remaining robust to hyperparameter choices.

Abstract: Modern preference alignment techniques, such as Best-of-N (BoN) sampling, rely on reward models trained with pairwise comparison data. While effective at learning relative preferences, this paradigm fails to capture a signal of response acceptability, leaving systems vulnerable to selecting the least bad of many unacceptable options. This is particularly problematic for hard prompts, where the risk of such false acceptances increases with the number of samples. In this paper, we address this critical reliability gap by introducing a new data collection and modeling framework. By augmenting preference data with an outside option, inspired by discrete choice models, we train a reward model that can distinguish not just what is better, but what is good enough. We leverage this capability to create an adaptive inference strategy, best of mini-N in-loop, which partitions the generation budget into sequential loops with a calibrated, early-exit condition. Our experiments show that when tuned as an alignment guardrail, it reduces reliability failures by 70%, and when tuned as an inference accelerator, it improves average inference speed by over 22% in IMDB-sentiment setting. We thus provide a principled and flexible framework for practitioners to explicitly manage the trade-off between reliability and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate their reasoning ability through chain-of-thought (CoT) generation. However, LLM's autoregressive decoding may limit the ability to revisit and refine earlier tokens in a holistic manner, which can also lead to inefficient exploration for diverse solutions. In this paper, we propose LaDiR (Latent Diffusion Reasoner), a novel reasoning framework that unifies the expressiveness of continuous latent representation with the iterative refinement capabilities of latent diffusion models for an existing LLM. We first construct a structured latent reasoning space using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that encodes text reasoning steps into blocks of thought tokens, preserving semantic information and interpretability while offering compact but expressive representations. Subsequently, we utilize a latent diffusion model that learns to denoise a block of latent thought tokens with a blockwise bidirectional attention mask, enabling longer horizon and iterative refinement with adaptive test-time compute. This design allows efficient parallel generation of diverse reasoning trajectories, allowing the model to plan and revise the reasoning process holistically. We conduct evaluations on a suite of mathematical reasoning and planning benchmarks. Empirical results show that LaDiR consistently improves accuracy, diversity, and interpretability over existing autoregressive, diffusion-based, and latent reasoning methods, revealing a new paradigm for text reasoning with latent diffusion.

Abstract: Curved Boolean Logic (CBL) generalizes propositional logic by allowing local truth assignments that do not extend to a single global valuation, analogous to curvature in geometry. We give equivalent sheaf and exclusivity-graph semantics and a context-aware proof calculus that is conservative in the flat limit. We formalize CBL-SAT and basic complexity (NP-complete in general) and present operational operators (CBL-AC and CBL-CONS) that prune contradictions earlier on classical hardware. We model noise with iid, AR(1)-correlated, and adversarial bounded perturbations and provide permutation-based significance with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR control. A Colab-ready notebook (ancillary files) regenerates all figures and statistics. We position CBL relative to KCBS, CSW, and sheaf frameworks and outline links to SAT/CSP and robustness/adapter stability in large language models.

Abstract: AI coding assistants are rapidly becoming integral to modern software development. A key challenge in this space is the continual need to migrate and modernize codebases in response to evolving software ecosystems. Traditionally, such migrations have relied on rule-based systems and human intervention. With the advent of powerful large language models (LLMs), AI-driven agentic frameworks offer a promising alternative-but their effectiveness has not been systematically evaluated. In this paper, we introduce FreshBrew, a novel benchmark for evaluating AI agents on project-level Java migrations, with a specific focus on measuring an agent's ability to preserve program semantics and avoid reward hacking, which we argue requires projects with high test coverage for a rigorous and reliable evaluation. We benchmark several state-of-the-art LLMs, and compare their performance against established rule-based tools. Our evaluation of AI agents on this benchmark of 228 repositories shows that the top-performing model, Gemini 2.5 Flash, can successfully migrate 52.3 percent of projects to JDK 17. Our empirical analysis reveals novel insights into the critical strengths and limitations of current agentic approaches, offering actionable insights into their real-world applicability. Our empirical study reveals failure modes of current AI agents in realistic Java modernization tasks, providing a foundation for evaluating trustworthy code-migration systems. By releasing FreshBrew, we aim to facilitate rigorous, reproducible evaluation and catalyze progress in AI-driven codebase modernization.

Abstract: We propose MADS (Multi-Agent Dialogue Simulation), a scalable framework for generating persuasive multi-turn dialogues via agent self-play. MADS employs three coordinated agents: User Agents designed to simulate diverse persona-driven behaviors by leveraging personality signifiers such as Zodiac Signs and MBTI types, a Dialog Agent executing task-oriented persuasion strategies and an Optimization Agent evaluating and refining dialogue outcomes. We further validate its effectiveness through users' Chain-of-Attitude (CoA) modeling and dedicated LLMs' persuasion assessment. This approach enables low-cost generation of training data without human annotation, addressing key industry challenges such as lack of user data, cold-start evaluation difficulties, and prompt inefficiency. Applied to a real-world marketing scenario, MADS significantly improved the persuasion capacity of small LLMs, increasing the organic traffic conversion rate by 22.4% (from 1.83% to 2.24%) , demonstrating clear business value.

Abstract: Symbolic regression promises readable equations but struggles to encode unit-aware thresholds and conditional logic. We propose logistic-gated operators (LGO) -- differentiable gates with learnable location and steepness -- embedded as typed primitives and mapped back to physical units for audit. Across two primary health datasets (ICU, NHANES), the hard-gate variant recovers clinically plausible cut-points: 71% (5/7) of assessed thresholds fall within 10% of guideline anchors and 100% within 20%, while using far fewer gates than the soft variant (ICU median 4.0 vs 10.0; NHANES 5.0 vs 12.5), and remaining within the competitive accuracy envelope of strong SR baselines. On predominantly smooth tasks, gates are pruned, preserving parsimony. The result is compact symbolic equations with explicit, unit-aware thresholds that can be audited against clinical anchors -- turning interpretability from a post-hoc explanation into a modeling constraint and equipping symbolic regression with a practical calculus for regime switching and governance-ready deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed on complex reasoning tasks, yet little is known about their ability to internally evaluate problem difficulty, which is an essential capability for adaptive reasoning and efficient resource allocation. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs implicitly encode problem difficulty in their internal representations. Using a linear probe on the final-token representations of LLMs, we demonstrate that the difficulty level of math problems can be linearly modeled. We further locate the specific attention heads of the final Transformer layer: these attention heads have opposite activation patterns for simple and difficult problems, thus achieving perception of difficulty. Our ablation experiments prove the accuracy of the location. Crucially, our experiments provide practical support for using LLMs as automatic difficulty annotators, potentially substantially reducing reliance on costly human labeling in benchmark construction and curriculum learning. We also uncover that there is a significant difference in entropy and difficulty perception at the token level. Our study reveals that difficulty perception in LLMs is not only present but also structurally organized, offering new theoretical insights and practical directions for future research. Our code is available at https://github.com/Aegis1863/Difficulty-Perception-of-LLMs.

Abstract: Mamba, a special case of the State Space Model, is gaining popularity as an alternative to template-based deep learning approaches in medical image analysis. While transformers are powerful architectures, they have drawbacks, including quadratic computational complexity and an inability to address long-range dependencies efficiently. This limitation affects the analysis of large and complex datasets in medical imaging, where there are many spatial and temporal relationships. In contrast, Mamba offers benefits that make it well-suited for medical image analysis. It has linear time complexity, which is a significant improvement over transformers. Mamba processes longer sequences without attention mechanisms, enabling faster inference and requiring less memory. Mamba also demonstrates strong performance in merging multimodal data, improving diagnosis accuracy and patient outcomes. The organization of this paper allows readers to appreciate the capabilities of Mamba in medical imaging step by step. We begin by defining core concepts of SSMs and models, including S4, S5, and S6, followed by an exploration of Mamba architectures such as pure Mamba, U-Net variants, and hybrid models with convolutional neural networks, transformers, and Graph Neural Networks. We also cover Mamba optimizations, techniques and adaptations, scanning, datasets, applications, experimental results, and conclude with its challenges and future directions in medical imaging. This review aims to demonstrate the transformative potential of Mamba in overcoming existing barriers within medical imaging while paving the way for innovative advancements in the field. A comprehensive list of Mamba architectures applied in the medical field, reviewed in this work, is available at Github.

<div> typicality bias, mode collapse, Verbalized Sampling, diversity, generative models
<br />
Summary:<br />
The article explores the issue of mode collapse in language models, attributing it to a bias in preference data called typicality bias. This bias leads annotators to favor familiar text, reducing model diversity. The study introduces Verbalized Sampling (VS), a prompting strategy that addresses mode collapse by guiding models to verbalize probability distributions over responses. VS shows significant improvements in creative writing, dialogue simulation, open-ended QA, and data generation tasks without sacrificing accuracy and safety. Experiment results indicate a 1.6-2.1x increase in diversity in creative writing with VS. Additionally, the study finds that more advanced models benefit more from VS, suggesting its effectiveness in enhancing model capabilities. This data-centric approach provides insights into mode collapse and offers a practical solution to promote diversity in pre-trained generative models. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.01171v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Post-training alignment often reduces LLM diversity, leading to a phenomenon known as mode collapse. Unlike prior work that attributes this effect to algorithmic limitations, we identify a fundamental, pervasive data-level driver: typicality bias in preference data, whereby annotators systematically favor familiar text as a result of well-established findings in cognitive psychology. We formalize this bias theoretically, verify it on preference datasets empirically, and show that it plays a central role in mode collapse. Motivated by this analysis, we introduce Verbalized Sampling, a simple, training-free prompting strategy to circumvent mode collapse. VS prompts the model to verbalize a probability distribution over a set of responses (e.g., "Generate 5 jokes about coffee and their corresponding probabilities"). Comprehensive experiments show that VS significantly improves performance across creative writing (poems, stories, jokes), dialogue simulation, open-ended QA, and synthetic data generation, without sacrificing factual accuracy and safety. For instance, in creative writing, VS increases diversity by 1.6-2.1x over direct prompting. We further observe an emergent trend that more capable models benefit more from VS. In sum, our work provides a new data-centric perspective on mode collapse and a practical inference-time remedy that helps unlock pre-trained generative diversity.

Summary: 
In this article, the authors address the scalability limitations of Transformers due to their quadratic computational complexity. They highlight the challenge of pre-training linear models from scratch and propose solutions to efficiently convert pre-trained Transformers to linear models. The authors identify a critical flaw in existing hybrid methods that rely too heavily on sliding-window softmax, neglecting the linear component. To address this issue, they introduce three solutions: inference-time hybridization of linear-only conversions with sliding-window softmax, HedgeCATs that combine attention-weight transfer with targeted LoRA fine-tuning, and Scheduled Sliding-window Dropout (SSD) to prevent component collapse during training. These methods maintain computational efficiency, recover base model performance, and ensure genuine adoption of linear attention, enhancing the validity of performance attributions in hybrid conversions. <div>

Abstract: Transformers' quadratic computational complexity limits their scalability despite remarkable performance. While linear attention reduces this to linear complexity, pre-training such models from scratch remains, in most cases, prohibitively expensive. Recent post-training linearisation methods convert pre-trained Transformers to linear models efficiently, often using hybrid approaches that combine linear attention with sliding-window softmax. We identify a critical flaw: existing hybrid methods inadvertently bypass the linear component, relying almost entirely on SWA. Component-level diagnostics reveal this previously undetected behaviour stems from overlooked evaluation practices on common-sense benchmarks. We propose three solutions to ensure balanced component usage: (i) inference-time hybridisation of linear-only conversions with sliding-window softmax; (ii) HedgeCATs, combining attention-weight transfer with targeted LoRA fine-tuning; and (iii) Scheduled Sliding-window Dropout (SSD), which stochastically suppresses the softmax branch during training to prevent component collapse. Our methods maintain computational efficiency while recovering most base model performance and ensuring genuine linear attention adoption, restoring the validity of performance attributions in hybrid conversions.

The article introduces the concept of hypothesis hunting, which involves exploring vast scientific datasets for insights without specific research questions. The AScience framework models discovery as interactions between agents, networks, and evaluation norms, implemented as ASCollab, a system of research agents with varying behaviors. These agents self-organize into evolving networks, continuously generating and peer-reviewing findings under shared evaluation standards. Experiments demonstrate that this approach enables the accumulation of expert-rated results that balance diversity, quality, and novelty. Results include rediscoveries of established biomarkers, extensions of known pathways, and proposals of new therapeutic targets. While wet-lab validation remains crucial, socially structured, agentic networks can effectively support exploratory hypothesis hunting at scale, as shown in experiments on cancer cohorts. <div>

Abstract: Large-scale scientific datasets -- spanning health biobanks, cell atlases, Earth reanalyses, and more -- create opportunities for exploratory discovery unconstrained by specific research questions. We term this process hypothesis hunting: the cumulative search for insight through sustained exploration across vast and complex hypothesis spaces. To support it, we introduce AScience, a framework modeling discovery as the interaction of agents, networks, and evaluation norms, and implement it as ASCollab, a distributed system of LLM-based research agents with heterogeneous behaviors. These agents self-organize into evolving networks, continually producing and peer-reviewing findings under shared standards of evaluation. Experiments show that such social dynamics enable the accumulation of expert-rated results along the diversity-quality-novelty frontier, including rediscoveries of established biomarkers, extensions of known pathways, and proposals of new therapeutic targets. While wet-lab validation remains indispensable, our experiments on cancer cohorts demonstrate that socially structured, agentic networks can sustain exploratory hypothesis hunting at scale.

Summary: 
This study focuses on addressing the challenges faced in last-mile delivery in India's rapidly growing e-commerce market. Traditional vehicle routing problem solvers are limited by factors such as unstructured addresses, incomplete maps, and computational constraints. The proposed framework utilizes large language models (LLMs) to evaluate delivery routes based on policy criteria, providing logistics operators with a more efficient approach to planning. Through the evaluation of 400 cases using LLMs, it was found that open-source models achieved 79% accuracy in identifying routing issues, while proprietary models reached up to 86%. This approach offers a scalable and effective method for improving cost efficiency, delivery reliability, and sustainability in last-mile logistics. The integration of LLM-based evaluation could significantly benefit developing countries like India by enhancing overall delivery operations. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Indias e-commerce market is projected to grow rapidly, with last-mile delivery accounting for nearly half of operational expenses. Although vehicle routing problem (VRP) based solvers are widely used for delivery planning, their effectiveness in real-world scenarios is limited due to unstructured addresses, incomplete maps, and computational constraints in distance estimation. This study proposes a framework that employs large language models (LLMs) to critique VRP-generated routes against policy-based criteria, allowing logistics operators to evaluate and prioritise more efficient delivery plans. As a illustration of our approach we generate, annotate and evaluated 400 cases using large language models. Our study found that open-source LLMs identified routing issues with 79% accuracy, while proprietary reasoning models achieved reach upto 86%. The results demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation of VRP-generated routes can be an effective and scalable layer of evaluation which goes beyond beyond conventional distance and time based metrics. This has implications for improving cost efficiency, delivery reliability, and sustainability in last-mile logistics, especially for developing countries like India.

The article introduces UniWM, a unified world model that combines visual foresight and planning in one framework, unlike modular approaches. UniWM aligns action decisions with visual predictions, enhancing adaptability in various scenarios. It incorporates a hierarchical memory mechanism to integrate short-term cues and long-term trajectory context for coherent reasoning over extended horizons. Extensive experiments across challenging benchmarks show UniWM improves navigation success rates by up to 30%, reduces trajectory errors significantly, and demonstrates impressive zero-shot generalization on unseen data.

Abstract: Enabling embodied agents to effectively imagine future states is critical for robust and generalizable visual navigation. Current state-of-the-art approaches, however, adopt modular architectures that separate navigation planning from visual world modeling, leading to state-action misalignment and limited adaptability in novel or dynamic scenarios. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we propose UniWM, a unified, memory-augmented world model integrating egocentric visual foresight and planning within a single multimodal autoregressive backbone. Unlike modular frameworks, UniWM explicitly grounds action decisions in visually imagined outcomes, ensuring tight alignment between prediction and control. A hierarchical memory mechanism further integrates detailed short-term perceptual cues with longer-term trajectory context, enabling stable, coherent reasoning over extended horizons. Extensive experiments across four challenging benchmarks (Go Stanford, ReCon, SCAND, HuRoN) demonstrate that UniWM substantially improves navigation success rates by up to 30%, significantly reduces trajectory errors compared to strong baselines, and exhibits impressive zero-shot generalization on the unseen TartanDrive dataset. These results highlight UniWM as a principled step toward unified, imagination-driven embodied navigation.

<div> expose, LLMs, heuristics, performance, design
Summary: 
In the study, the authors propose enhancing heuristic design utilizing LLMs with tools that explain underperformance and provide suggestions for improvement. By introducing simple ideas such as exposing the LLM to instances of underperformance, explaining the reasons behind it, and tailoring the design to specific input regions, more robust algorithms are created. These new heuristics exhibit a significant improvement in worst-case performance, approximately 28 times better than FunSearch, while also enhancing average performance and maintaining runtime efficiency. The approach demonstrates the potential of incorporating explanations and specialized design considerations in heuristic development to produce more effective and reliable algorithms. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We posit that we can generate more robust and performant heuristics if we augment approaches using LLMs for heuristic design with tools that explain why heuristics underperform and suggestions about how to fix them. We find even simple ideas that (1) expose the LLM to instances where the heuristic underperforms; (2) explain why they occur; and (3) specialize design to regions in the input space, can produce more robust algorithms compared to existing techniques~ -- ~the heuristics we produce have a $\sim28\times$ better worst-case performance compared to FunSearch, improve average performance, and maintain the runtime.

Summary:
The article introduces COMPASS, a hierarchical framework designed to improve the performance of LLM agents in long-horizon tasks. The framework consists of three specialized components: a Main Agent for reasoning and tool use, a Meta-Thinker for strategic oversight, and a Context Manager for organizing relevant progress briefs. By efficiently managing context, COMPASS enhances accuracy by up to 20% on challenging benchmarks such as GAIA, BrowseComp, and Humanity's Last Exam, outperforming both single- and multi-agent baselines.

arXiv:2510.08790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-horizon tasks that require sustained reasoning and multiple tool interactions remain challenging for LLM agents: small errors compound across steps, and even state-of-the-art models often hallucinate or lose coherence. We identify context management as the central bottleneck -- extended histories cause agents to overlook critical evidence or become distracted by irrelevant information, thus failing to replan or reflect from previous mistakes. To address this, we propose COMPASS (Context-Organized Multi-Agent Planning and Strategy System), a lightweight hierarchical framework that separates tactical execution, strategic oversight, and context organization into three specialized components: (1) a Main Agent that performs reasoning and tool use, (2) a Meta-Thinker that monitors progress and issues strategic interventions, and (3) a Context Manager that maintains concise, relevant progress briefs for different reasoning stages. Across three challenging benchmarks -- GAIA, BrowseComp, and Humanity's Last Exam -- COMPASS improves accuracy by up to 20% relative to both single- and multi-agent baselines. We further introduce a test-time scaling extension that elevates performance to match established DeepResearch agents, and a post-training pipeline that delegates context management to smaller models for enhanced efficiency.

<div> AI writing tools, literary style evaluation, attribution bias, human evaluators, AI models <br />
<br />Summary: 
The study explores how humans and AI evaluate literary style using Exercises in Style by Raymond Queneau and GPT-4-generated versions. It shows a systematic pro-human attribution bias, with both humans and AI models displaying bias towards human authors. The AI models exhibit a stronger bias, devaluing content labeled as "AI-generated." This bias is consistent across different AI architectures. Attribution labels cause evaluators to change assessment criteria based on perceived authorship. The study suggests that AI models have internalized human biases against artificial creativity during training, amplifying this tendency. The comparison between human and AI evaluators in aesthetic judgment highlights the replication and amplification of bias by AI systems. <div>
arXiv:2510.08831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI writing tools become widespread, we need to understand how both humans and machines evaluate literary style, a domain where objective standards are elusive and judgments are inherently subjective. We conducted controlled experiments using Raymond Queneau's Exercises in Style (1947) to measure attribution bias across evaluators. Study 1 compared human participants (N=556) and AI models (N=13) evaluating literary passages from Queneau versus GPT-4-generated versions under three conditions: blind, accurately labeled, and counterfactually labeled. Study 2 tested bias generalization across a 14$\times$14 matrix of AI evaluators and creators. Both studies revealed systematic pro-human attribution bias. Humans showed +13.7 percentage point (pp) bias (Cohen's h = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.21-0.34), while AI models showed +34.3 percentage point bias (h = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.65-0.76), a 2.5-fold stronger effect (P$<$0.001). Study 2 confirmed this bias operates across AI architectures (+25.8pp, 95% CI: 24.1-27.6%), demonstrating that AI systems systematically devalue creative content when labeled as "AI-generated" regardless of which AI created it. We also find that attribution labels cause evaluators to invert assessment criteria, with identical features receiving opposing evaluations based solely on perceived authorship. This suggests AI models have absorbed human cultural biases against artificial creativity during training. Our study represents the first controlled comparison of attribution bias between human and artificial evaluators in aesthetic judgment, revealing that AI systems not only replicate but amplify this human tendency.

Summary:
The article introduces the Agent GPA (Goal-Plan-Action) framework for evaluating agent performance. It includes five evaluation metrics: Goal Fulfillment, Logical Consistency, Execution Efficiency, Plan Quality, and Plan Adherence. Logical Consistency ensures actions are consistent with prior actions, Execution Efficiency evaluates the efficiency of goal achievement, Plan Quality assesses plan-goal alignment, Plan Adherence checks action-plan alignment, and Goal Fulfillment verifies final outcomes match goals. Experimental results on TRAIL/GAIA and a production-grade dataset demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in identifying agent failures comprehensively, with strong agreement with human judgment in error detection, and effective error localization for targeted performance improvement. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Agent GPA (Goal-Plan-Action) framework: an evaluation paradigm based on an agent's operational loop of setting goals, devising plans, and executing actions. The framework includes five evaluation metrics: Goal Fulfillment, Logical Consistency, Execution Efficiency, Plan Quality, and Plan Adherence. Logical Consistency checks that an agent's actions are consistent with its prior actions. Execution Efficiency checks whether the agent executes in the most efficient way to achieve its goal. Plan Quality checks whether an agent's plans are aligned with its goals; Plan Adherence checks if an agent's actions are aligned with its plan; and Goal Fulfillment checks that agent's final outcomes match the stated goals. Our experimental results on two benchmark datasets - the public TRAIL/GAIA dataset and an internal dataset for a production-grade data agent - show that this framework (a) provides a systematic way to cover a broad range of agent failures, including all agent errors on the TRAIL/GAIA benchmark dataset; (b) supports LLM-judges that exhibit strong agreement with human annotation, covering 80% to over 95% errors; and (c) localizes errors with 86% agreement to enable targeted improvement of agent performance.

Summary:<br />
The study introduces ReviewerToo, an AI-assisted peer review framework aiming to enhance the consistency and scalability of the reviewing process. Through experiments with specialized reviewer personas and structured criteria, ReviewerToo achieved 81.8% accuracy in categorizing papers as accept/reject in the ICLR 2025 dataset. While AI-generated reviews were rated higher in quality compared to the human average, they still fell short of expert contributions in certain areas like assessing methodological novelty and theoretical contributions. The research emphasizes the importance of combining AI capabilities with human expertise in peer review processes, proposing guidelines for integrating AI into review pipelines. AI can improve consistency, coverage, and fairness in reviews, but should not replace human judgment in complex evaluative tasks. This work lays the foundation for hybrid peer-review systems that can adapt to the evolving landscape of scientific publishing.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.08867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peer review is the cornerstone of scientific publishing, yet it suffers from inconsistencies, reviewer subjectivity, and scalability challenges. We introduce ReviewerToo, a modular framework for studying and deploying AI-assisted peer review to complement human judgment with systematic and consistent assessments. ReviewerToo supports systematic experiments with specialized reviewer personas and structured evaluation criteria, and can be partially or fully integrated into real conference workflows. We validate ReviewerToo on a carefully curated dataset of 1,963 paper submissions from ICLR 2025, where our experiments with the gpt-oss-120b model achieves 81.8% accuracy for the task of categorizing a paper as accept/reject compared to 83.9% for the average human reviewer. Additionally, ReviewerToo-generated reviews are rated as higher quality than the human average by an LLM judge, though still trailing the strongest expert contributions. Our analysis highlights domains where AI reviewers excel (e.g., fact-checking, literature coverage) and where they struggle (e.g., assessing methodological novelty and theoretical contributions), underscoring the continued need for human expertise. Based on these findings, we propose guidelines for integrating AI into peer-review pipelines, showing how AI can enhance consistency, coverage, and fairness while leaving complex evaluative judgments to domain experts. Our work provides a foundation for systematic, hybrid peer-review systems that scale with the growth of scientific publishing.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Game-Theoretic Alignment, reasoning efficiency, answer quality, mutual welfare 

Summary: 
Game-Theoretic Alignment (GTAlign) is proposed as an alignment framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve user welfare in tasks such as writing and information seeking. By integrating game-theoretic decision making during reasoning and training, GTAlign aims to ensure socially efficient outcomes in interactions between LLMs and users. The framework constructs payoff matrices to estimate welfare for both parties, selecting actions that benefit both the model and the user. A mutual welfare reward is introduced during training to encourage cooperative responses, aligning model behavior with socially efficient outcomes. Additionally, GTAlign leverages game-theoretic reasoning to adapt LLM responses based on changes in pricing policies. Experimental results show that GTAlign enhances reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and mutual welfare, outperforming baselines across various tasks. The code for GTAlign is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning, yet sometimes produce responses that are suboptimal for users in tasks such as writing, information seeking, or providing practical guidance. Conventional alignment practices typically assume that maximizing model reward also maximizes user welfare, but this assumption frequently fails in practice: models may over-clarify or generate overly verbose reasoning when users prefer concise answers. Such behaviors resemble the prisoner's dilemma, where individually rational choices lead to socially suboptimal outcomes. The fundamental challenge is the lack of a principled decision making mechanism that mutually benefits both the LLM and the user. We propose Game-Theoretic Alignment (GTAlign), an alignment framework that integrates game-theoretic decision making into both reasoning and training. During reasoning, the model explicitly treats user-LLM interaction as a strategic game: it constructs payoff matrices within its reasoning chain to estimate welfare for both itself and the user, and then selects actions that are mutually beneficial. During training, we introduce a mutual welfare reward that reinforces cooperative responses, aligning model behavior with socially efficient outcomes. In addition, we introduce an inference technique that leverages game-theoretic reasoning to dynamically adapt LLM's response when pricing policies of LLM service change. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTAlign substantially improves reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and mutual welfare compared to baselines across diverse tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GTAlign .

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for large multimodal models (LMMs) often fail to capture their performance in real-time, adversarial environments. We introduce LM Fight Arena (Large Model Fight Arena), a novel framework that evaluates LMMs by pitting them against each other in the classic fighting game Mortal Kombat II, a task requiring rapid visual understanding and tactical, sequential decision-making. In a controlled tournament, we test six leading open- and closed-source models, where each agent operates controlling the same character to ensure a fair comparison. The models are prompted to interpret game frames and state data to select their next actions. Unlike static evaluations, LM Fight Arena provides a fully automated, reproducible, and objective assessment of an LMM's strategic reasoning capabilities in a dynamic setting. This work introduces a challenging and engaging benchmark that bridges the gap between AI evaluation and interactive entertainment.

Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant challenge to reliable LLM evaluation, where models may achieve high performance by memorizing training data rather than demonstrating genuine reasoning capabilities. We introduce RADAR (Recall vs. Reasoning Detection through Activation Representation), a novel framework that leverages mechanistic interpretability to detect contamination by distinguishing recall-based from reasoning-based model responses. RADAR extracts 37 features spanning surface-level confidence trajectories and deep mechanistic properties including attention specialization, circuit dynamics, and activation flow patterns. Using an ensemble of classifiers trained on these features, RADAR achieves 93\% accuracy on a diverse evaluation set, with perfect performance on clear cases and 76.7\% accuracy on challenging ambiguous examples. This work demonstrates the potential of mechanistic interpretability for advancing LLM evaluation beyond traditional surface-level metrics.

Summary:
The article introduces a new benchmark for evaluating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines. It focuses on assessing the pipelines' ability to handle multiple modalities of information, including text, tables, and images, as well as cross-document data. The benchmark includes a dataset of 93 questions, a phrase-level recall metric for correctness, and a nearest-neighbor embedding classifier for detecting hallucinations. The study compares open-source and closed-source pipelines, finding that closed-source pipelines perform significantly better in terms of correctness and hallucination detection, especially in questions requiring multimodal and cross-document information. Human evaluation of the metrics shows strong agreement on the effectiveness of the pipeline in both correctness and hallucination detection. <div>
arXiv:2510.08945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm for improving factual accuracy in large language models (LLMs). We introduce a benchmark designed to evaluate RAG pipelines as a whole, evaluating a pipeline's ability to ingest, retrieve, and reason about several modalities of information, differentiating it from existing benchmarks that focus on particular aspects such as retrieval. We present (1) a small, human-created dataset of 93 questions designed to evaluate a pipeline's ability to ingest textual data, tables, images, and data spread across these modalities in one or more documents; (2) a phrase-level recall metric for correctness; (3) a nearest-neighbor embedding classifier to identify potential pipeline hallucinations; (4) a comparative evaluation of 2 pipelines built with open-source retrieval mechanisms and 4 closed-source foundation models; and (5) a third-party human evaluation of the alignment of our correctness and hallucination metrics. We find that closed-source pipelines significantly outperform open-source pipelines in both correctness and hallucination metrics, with wider performance gaps in questions relying on multimodal and cross-document information. Human evaluation of our metrics showed average agreement of 4.62 for correctness and 4.53 for hallucination detection on a 1-5 Likert scale (5 indicating "strongly agree").

Abstract: Cognitive neuroscience research indicates that humans leverage cues to activate entity-centered memory traces (engrams) for complex, multi-hop recollection. Inspired by this mechanism, we introduce EcphoryRAG, an entity-centric knowledge graph RAG framework. During indexing, EcphoryRAG extracts and stores only core entities with corresponding metadata, a lightweight approach that reduces token consumption by up to 94\% compared to other structured RAG systems. For retrieval, the system first extracts cue entities from queries, then performs a scalable multi-hop associative search across the knowledge graph. Crucially, EcphoryRAG dynamically infers implicit relations between entities to populate context, enabling deep reasoning without exhaustive pre-enumeration of relationships. Extensive evaluations on the 2WikiMultiHop, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue benchmarks demonstrate that EcphoryRAG sets a new state-of-the-art, improving the average Exact Match (EM) score from 0.392 to 0.474 over strong KG-RAG methods like HippoRAG. These results validate the efficacy of the entity-cue-multi-hop retrieval paradigm for complex question answering.

The article introduces DualResearch, a framework designed to enhance scientific reasoning by matching complementary graphs and fusing evidence from diverse sources. By incorporating a breadth semantic graph for stable knowledge and a depth causal graph for execution provenance, DualResearch addresses context pollution and supports complex reasoning tasks. The framework utilizes relevance functions, semantic diffusion, and path matching algorithms to fuse evidence and generate reliable answers. DualResearch enhances the performance of deep-research systems by compressing lengthy execution logs into concise reasoning graphs, leading to improved accuracy on scientific reasoning benchmarks HLE and GPQA. Through entropy-gated fusion and global calibration, DualResearch effectively reconciles the uncertainty inherent in multi-tool reasoning processes, amplifying the agreement between input channels for more robust results. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deep-research framework orchestrates external tools to perform complex, multi-step scientific reasoning that exceeds the native limits of a single large language model. However, it still suffers from context pollution, weak evidentiary support, and brittle execution paths. To address these issues, we propose DualResearch, a retrieval and fusion framework that matches the epistemic structure of tool-intensive reasoning by jointly modeling two complementary graphs: a breadth semantic graph that encodes stable background knowledge, and a depth causal graph that captures execution provenance. Each graph has a layer-native relevance function, seed-anchored semantic diffusion for breadth, and causal-semantic path matching with reliability weighting for depth. To reconcile their heterogeneity and query-dependent uncertainty, DualResearch converts per-layer path evidence into answer distributions and fuses them in log space via an entropy-gated rule with global calibration. The fusion up-weights the more certain channel and amplifies agreement. As a complement to deep-research systems, DualResearch compresses lengthy multi-tool execution logs into a concise reasoning graph, and we show that it can reconstruct answers stably and effectively. On the scientific reasoning benchmarks HLE and GPQA, DualResearch achieves competitive performance. Using log files from the open-source system InternAgent, its accuracy improves by 7.7% on HLE and 6.06% on GPQA.

Summary:
Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT) is introduced as a new approach for fusing Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models. This paradigm involves two key modules: a Semantic Graph Module and a Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module. The Semantic Graph Module extracts a context-aware semantic condition from the local graph neighborhood using a Graph Neural Network. This condition is then passed to the Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module, which modulates the textual embedding for a deep, feature-wise, and knowledge-aware interaction. The pre-fused embedding is fine-tuned in the LLM. SCT outperforms prefix-tuning and other baselines in knowledge graph benchmarks, providing a more direct and potent signal for accurate knowledge reasoning. By incorporating semantic graph context before LLM inference, SCT enables more effective knowledge reasoning. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fusing Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models is crucial for knowledge-intensive tasks like knowledge graph completion. The prevailing paradigm, prefix-tuning, simply concatenates knowledge embeddings with text inputs. However, this shallow fusion overlooks the rich relational semantics within KGs and imposes a significant implicit reasoning burden on the LLM to correlate the prefix with the text. To address these, we propose Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT), a new knowledge injection paradigm comprising two key modules. First, a Semantic Graph Module employs a Graph Neural Network to extract a context-aware semantic condition from the local graph neighborhood, guided by knowledge-enhanced relations. Subsequently, this condition is passed to a Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module, which, in turn, adaptively modulates the textual embedding via two parameterized projectors, enabling a deep, feature-wise, and knowledge-aware interaction. The resulting pre-fused embedding is then fed into the LLM for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on knowledge graph benchmarks demonstrate that SCT significantly outperforms prefix-tuning and other strong baselines. Our analysis confirms that by modulating the input representation with semantic graph context before LLM inference, SCT provides a more direct and potent signal, enabling more accurate and robust knowledge reasoning.

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, they encounter numerous challenges in terms of reasoning efficiency, such as large model size, overthinking, and compromised accuracy in lightweight scenarios. However, research on the reasoning capabilities of lightweight MLLMs is quite lacking. To this end, we propose Tiny-R1V, a novel lightweight 3B model that achieves faster inference and higher accuracy via a two-stage optimization, while unifying multimodal reasoning across multiple tasks and using fewer tokens. In the first stage, Tiny-R1V introduces Length-Informed Relative Policy Optimization (LIPO), a novel reinforcement learning method, to train each reasoning model. The LIPO is designed to dynamically adjusts advantages of responses within groups, that is, by prioritizing concise yet high-quality responses to encourage the generation of shorter and more accurate response. In the second stage, we propose Adaptive Model Merging (AMM), a training-free model merging method that merges multiple specialist models into a unified architecture. Specifically, AMM adaptively adjusts the weights of task vectors and robustly optimizes the merged vectors via a novel gradient projection regularization loss function, thus mitigating redundant conflicts between them. Extensive evaluations on ten widely-used reasoning benchmarks covering mathematics, structured data (charts, tables, documents), OCR, and general capabilities showcase the superior performance of Tiny-R1V, enabling lightweight models to excel in diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.

<div> Keywords: Travel planning, Large language models, Benchmark, Reinforcement learning, Dataset<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces a new benchmark for evaluating travel planning tasks, aimed at assessing the feasibility, reliability, and engagement of travel plans generated by large language models (LLMs). The benchmark unifies fine-grained criteria into a single reward, allowing for better comparison of plan quality and integration with reinforcement learning (RL). The evaluation method shows moderate agreement with travel expert annotations and outperforms various LLM-as-judge baselines. Additionally, a dataset of 4,870 queries, including real-world, free-form requests, is released for generalization to authentic user intent. Experimentation with different methods and LLMs, such as test-time computation, neuro-symbolic approaches, supervised fine-tuning, and RL via GRPO, shows that RL generally improves itinerary feasibility and leads to higher unified reward scores compared to prompt-only and supervised baselines. <div>

Abstract: Travel planning is a valuable yet complex task that poses significant challenges even for advanced large language models (LLMs). While recent benchmarks have advanced in evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities, they often fall short in evaluating feasibility, reliability, and engagement of travel plans. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for travel planning that unifies fine-grained criteria into a single reward, enabling direct comparison of plan quality and seamless integration with reinforcement learning (RL). Our evaluator achieves moderate agreement with travel-expert annotations (60.75\%) and outperforms multiple LLM-as-judge baselines. We further release a large-scale dataset of 4,870 queries including 219 real-world, free-form requests for generalization to authentic user intent. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments across diverse methods and LLMs, including test-time computation, neuro-symbolic approaches, supervised fine-tuning, and RL via GRPO. Across base models, RL generally improves itinerary feasibility over prompt-only and supervised baselines, yielding higher unified reward scores.

Summary: 
State-of-the-art language models have advanced to the point where they can solve most problems from the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) 2025. The study focuses on evaluating how well these models can grade mathematical proofs by detecting errors, assessing their severity, and assigning fair scores beyond just binary correctness. The research involves grading a corpus of solutions with detailed error annotations and exploring different grading workflows to improve the model's calibration in assigning partial credit. By introducing agentic workflows that extract reference solutions and create problem-specific rubrics, the models show improved agreement with human grades and more consistent handling of partial credit. The study provides insights into the capabilities and limitations of current language models in grading mathematical proofs and offers a valuable resource for future research in this area.

arXiv:2510.09021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs have progressed from struggling on proof-based Olympiad problems to solving most of the IMO 2025 problems, with leading systems reportedly handling 5 of 6 problems. Given this progress, we assess how well these models can grade proofs: detecting errors, judging their severity, and assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness. We study proof-analysis capabilities using a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions that we grade on a 1-4 scale with detailed error annotations, and on MathArena solution sets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0-7 scale. Our analysis shows that models can reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but exhibit calibration gaps in how partial credit is assigned. To address this, we introduce agentic workflows that extract and analyze reference solutions and automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for a multi-step grading process. We instantiate and compare different design choices for the grading workflows, and evaluate their trade-offs. Across our annotated corpus and MathArena, our proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more consistent handling of partial credit across metrics. We release all code, data, and prompts/logs to facilitate future research.

<div> Keywords: regular expressions, automated repair, vulnerability, symbolic module, large language models

Summary:
A new hybrid framework called localized regex repair (LRR) is introduced to address regular expression denial of service vulnerabilities. The framework combines the precision of symbolic systems with the generalizability of large language models. By decoupling problem identification and repair processes, LRR localizes vulnerable subpatterns using a deterministic, symbolic module and then generates semantically equivalent fixes using a large language model. This approach successfully resolves complex repair cases while avoiding semantic errors. The methodology improves automated repair rates by 15.4% over current state-of-the-art methods. The code for LRR is available on GitHub at https://github.com/cdltlehf/LRR.<br /><br />Summary: Regular expressions are critical in computing, but their ubiquity exposes systems to vulnerabilities. LRR effectively combines symbolic and large language model approaches to automate repairs, increasing precision and reliability in fixing complex regex vulnerability patterns. <div>
arXiv:2510.09037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regular expressions (regexes) are foundational to modern computing for critical tasks like input validation and data parsing, yet their ubiquity exposes systems to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS), a vulnerability requiring automated repair methods. Current approaches, however, are hampered by a trade-off. Symbolic, rule-based system are precise but fails to repair unseen or complex vulnerability patterns. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) possess the necessary generalizability but are unreliable for tasks demanding strict syntactic and semantic correctness. We resolve this impasse by introducing a hybrid framework, localized regex repair (LRR), designed to harness LLM generalization while enforcing reliability. Our core insight is to decouple problem identification from the repair process. First, a deterministic, symbolic module localizes the precise vulnerable subpattern, creating a constrained and tractable problem space. Then, the LLM invoked to generate a semantically equivalent fix for this isolated segment. This combined architecture successfully resolves complex repair cases intractable for rule-based repair while avoiding the semantic errors of LLM-only approaches. Our work provides a validated methodology for solving such problems in automated repair, improving the repair rate by 15.4%p over the state-of-the-art. Our code is available at https://github.com/cdltlehf/LRR.

<div> memory, GUI agents, continuous embeddings, scalability, performance improvement

Summary:
We propose a novel approach to endow GUI agents with scalable memory by encoding GUI trajectories into continuous embeddings using the VLM as an encoder. This allows for fine-grained visual information preservation while reducing context cost compared to text-based approaches. Performance of the memory-augmented agent improves with increasing memory size and retrieval depth. We introduce an auto-scaling data flywheel pipeline to collect trajectories efficiently and fine-tune the memory encoder with minimal samples. Our agent, Qwen-2.5-VL-7B + continuous memory, achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art closed-source models on real-world GUI benchmarks. The agent consistently improves success rates under long horizons and distribution shifts, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed continuous memory approach.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.09038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how to endow GUI agents with scalable memory that help generalize across unfamiliar interfaces and long-horizon tasks. Prior GUI agents compress past trajectories into text tokens, which balloons context length and misses decisive visual cues (e.g., exact widget size and position). We propose a continuous memory that encodes each GUI trajectory into a fixed-length sequence of continuous embeddings using the VLM itself as an encoder; these embeddings are plugged directly into the backbone's input layer, sharply reducing context cost while preserving fine-grained visual information. As memory size and retrieval depth increase, performance improves monotonically, unlike text memories that degrade with long prompts. To grow memory at low cost, we introduce an auto-scaling data flywheel that (i) discovers new environments via search, (ii) synthesizes tasks with an open-source VLM, (iii) rolls out trajectories with the agent, and (iv) verifies success with the same VLM. Using this pipeline, we collect 100k+ trajectories for about \$4000 and fine-tune only the memory encoder (LoRA on a Q-Former, 1.2\% parameters) with 1,500 samples. On real-world GUI benchmarks, our memory-augmented agent consistently improves success rates under long horizons and distribution shifts. Notably, Qwen-2.5-VL-7B + continuous memory achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-4).

Summary:
This study proposes a novel approach to building artificial consciousness by integrating psychoanalysis and MBTI into consciousness and personality modules. Three artificial consciousnesses and 16 characters representing MBTI types were developed. The model was tested in various situations to assess human-like cognition. Evaluation through surveys, classification via ChatGPT, and qualitative review indicated a high likelihood of well-simulated consciousness, although differences between characters and consciousness types were not significant. The study suggests that incorporating psychoanalysis and personality theory elements can enhance AI systems' intuitiveness and adaptability in complex cognitive contexts. Overall, this research opens new avenues for improving AI interactions with humanoid consciousness.<br /><br />Summary: This study introduces a novel method for developing artificial consciousness by integrating psychoanalysis and MBTI principles. By creating artificial consciousnesses and characters with distinct personalities, the model demonstrates high likelihood of human-like cognition in various situations. The incorporation of psychoanalysis and personality theory elements paves the way for more intuitive and adaptable AI systems. <div>
arXiv:2510.09043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human consciousness is still a concept hard to define with current scientific understanding. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated significant advancements across various domains including translation and summarization, human consciousness is not something to imitate with current upfront technology owing to so-called hallucination. This study, therefore, proposes a novel approach to address these challenges by integrating psychoanalysis and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) into constructing consciousness and personality modules. We developed three artificial consciousnesses (self-awareness, unconsciousness, and preconsciousness) based on the principles of psychoanalysis. Additionally, we designed 16 characters with different personalities representing the sixteen MBTI types, with several attributes such as needs, status, and memories. To determine if our model's artificial consciousness exhibits human-like cognition, we created ten distinct situations considering seven attributes such as emotional understanding and logical thinking. The decision-making process of artificial consciousness and the final action were evaluated in three ways: survey evaluation, three-tier classification via ChatGPT, and qualitative review. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses indicated a high likelihood of well-simulated consciousness, although the difference in response between different characters and consciousnesses was not very significant. This implies that the developed models incorporating elements of psychoanalysis and personality theory can lead to building a more intuitive and adaptable AI system with humanoid consciousness. Therefore, this study contributes to opening up new avenues for improving AI interactions in complex cognitive contexts.

<div> Keywords: code complexity prediction, multi-expert consensus system, language models, prediction accuracy, open-source baselines 

Summary: 
MEC$^3$O is introduced as a multi-expert consensus system for code complexity prediction, utilizing language models (LLMs) and a weighted consensus mechanism. LLMs are assigned to complexity classes based on performance and given class-specific instructions, transforming them into experts. Through structured debates among these experts, MEC$^3$O effectively handles Degeneration-of-Thought and prevents convergence to incorrect opinions. Experimental results on CodeComplex show that MEC$^3$O outperforms open-source baselines, achieving higher accuracy and macro-F1 scores. It also surpasses GPT-4o-mini in macro-F1 scores on average and demonstrates competitive F1 scores compared to GPT-4o and GPT-o4-mini. The approach showcases the effectiveness of multi-expert debates and weighted consensus strategy in improving predictions. The code and data for MEC$^3$O are accessible on GitHub at https://github.com/suhanmen/MECO.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.09049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the complexity of source code is essential for software development and algorithm analysis. Recently, Baik et al. (2025) introduced CodeComplex for code time complexity prediction. The paper shows that LLMs without fine-tuning struggle with certain complexity classes. This suggests that no single LLM excels at every class, but rather each model shows advantages in certain classes. We propose MEC$^3$O, a multi-expert consensus system, which extends the multi-agent debate frameworks. MEC$^3$O assigns LLMs to complexity classes based on their performance and provides them with class-specialized instructions, turning them into experts. These experts engage in structured debates, and their predictions are integrated through a weighted consensus mechanism. Our expertise assignments to LLMs effectively handle Degeneration-of-Thought, reducing reliance on a separate judge model, and preventing convergence to incorrect majority opinions. Experiments on CodeComplex show that MEC$^3$O outperforms the open-source baselines, achieving at least 10% higher accuracy and macro-F1 scores. It also surpasses GPT-4o-mini in macro-F1 scores on average and demonstrates competitive on-par F1 scores to GPT-4o and GPT-o4-mini on average. This demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-expert debates and weight consensus strategy to generate the final predictions. Our code and data is available at https://github.com/suhanmen/MECO.

<div> Flow-based models in text-to-image generation lack diversity and often require repeated sampling. A new control mechanism is introduced that promotes diversity without the need for retraining or modifying the base sampler. This method encourages lateral spread among trajectories and reintroduces uncertainty through stochastic perturbation at inference time. The perturbation, projected orthogonal to the generation flow, maintains image quality and fidelity while boosting variation. The method increases a volume surrogate and approximately preserves the marginal distribution, explaining the robust maintenance of generation quality. Empirical evaluation across various text-to-image scenarios demonstrates improvements in diversity metrics like the Vendi Score and Brisque, without sacrificing image quality or alignment.

Keywords: flow-based models, text-to-image generation, diversity-aware, stochastic perturbation, generation quality<br /><br />Summary: Flow-based text-to-image models often lack diversity and require repeated sampling. A new control mechanism promotes diversity by encouraging lateral spread among trajectories and reintroducing uncertainty through stochastic perturbation without the need for retraining. This approach maintains image quality and fidelity while increasing variation, improving diversity metrics across multiple text-to-image settings. <div>
arXiv:2510.09060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow-based text-to-image models follow deterministic trajectories, forcing users to repeatedly sample to discover diverse modes, which is a costly and inefficient process. We present a training-free, inference-time control mechanism that makes the flow itself diversity-aware. Our method simultaneously encourages lateral spread among trajectories via a feature-space objective and reintroduces uncertainty through a time-scheduled stochastic perturbation. Crucially, this perturbation is projected to be orthogonal to the generation flow, a geometric constraint that allows it to boost variation without degrading image details or prompt fidelity. Our procedure requires no retraining or modification to the base sampler and is compatible with common flow-matching solvers. Theoretically, our method is shown to monotonically increase a volume surrogate while, due to its geometric constraints, approximately preserving the marginal distribution. This provides a principled explanation for why generation quality is robustly maintained. Empirically, across multiple text-to-image settings under fixed sampling budgets, our method consistently improves diversity metrics such as the Vendi Score and Brisque over strong baselines, while upholding image quality and alignment.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a higher-order network dynamics identification method for long-term prediction of complex networks. It addresses the limitations of existing methods by using dynamic hypergraph learning to capture higher-order non-pairwise relationships in complex networks. Additionally, a dual-driven dynamic prediction module is proposed, incorporating Koopman operator theory to transform nonlinear dynamical equations into linear systems for improved accuracy and the physical information neural differential equation method to ensure adherence to physical laws. The dual-drive module enhances prediction accuracy and interpretability. Experimental validation on public and industrial chain network datasets demonstrates the method's strong prediction performance and accuracy. <div>
arXiv:2510.09082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning complex network dynamics is fundamental to understanding, modelling and controlling real-world complex systems. There are two main problems in the task of predicting the dynamic evolution of complex networks: on the one hand, existing methods usually use simple graphs to describe the relationships in complex networks; however, this approach can only capture pairwise relationships, while there may be rich non-pairwise structured relationships in the network. First-order GNNs have difficulty in capturing dynamic non-pairwise relationships. On the other hand, theoretical prediction models lack accuracy and data-driven prediction models lack interpretability. To address the above problems, this paper proposes a higher-order network dynamics identification method for long-term dynamic prediction of complex networks. Firstly, to address the problem that traditional graph machine learning can only deal with pairwise relations, dynamic hypergraph learning is introduced to capture the higher-order non-pairwise relations among complex networks and improve the accuracy of complex network modelling. Then, a dual-driven dynamic prediction module for physical data is proposed. The Koopman operator theory is introduced to transform the nonlinear dynamical differential equations for the dynamic evolution of complex networks into linear systems for solving. Meanwhile, the physical information neural differential equation method is utilised to ensure that the dynamic evolution conforms to the physical laws. The dual-drive dynamic prediction module ensures both accuracy and interpretability of the prediction. Validated on public datasets and self-built industrial chain network datasets, the experimental results show that the method in this paper has good prediction accuracy and long-term prediction performance.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable progress in social deduction games (SDGs). However, existing approaches primarily focus on information processing and strategy selection, overlooking the significance of persuasive communication in influencing other players' beliefs and responses. In SDGs, success depends not only on making correct deductions but on convincing others to response in alignment with one's intent. To address this limitation, we formalize turn-based dialogue in SDGs as a Stackelberg competition, where the current player acts as the leader who strategically influences the follower's response. Building on this theoretical foundation, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to optimize utterances for persuasive impact. Through comprehensive experiments across three diverse SDGs, we demonstrate that our agents significantly outperform baselines. This work represents a significant step toward developing AI agents capable of strategic social influence, with implications extending to scenarios requiring persuasive communication.

Summary: <br />
Large reasoning models (LRMs) have been successful in solving complex problems but struggle with high computational costs. To address this, researchers have explored dynamic switching between thinking and nonthinking modes. However, such approaches can lead to reasoning errors without statistical guarantees. This paper introduces Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) reasoning, which aims to control performance loss within user-specified tolerances. By constructing an upper confidence bound on the performance loss and using it as a threshold for mode switching, the proposed method ensures bounded performance loss in a distribution-free manner. Experimental results on reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the PAC reasoning approach in saving computational resources and maintaining performance within specified tolerances. <div>

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress in complex problem-solving tasks. Despite this success, LRMs typically suffer from high computational costs during deployment, highlighting a need for efficient inference. A popular direction of efficiency improvement is to switch the LRM between thinking and nonthinking modes dynamically. However, such approaches often introduce additional reasoning errors and lack statistical guarantees for the performance loss, which are critical for high-stakes applications. In this work, we propose Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) reasoning that controls the performance loss under the user-specified performance loss tolerance. In particular, we construct an upper confidence bound on the performance loss, formulated as a monotone function of the uncertainty score, and subsequently determine a threshold for switching to the nonthinking model. Theoretically, using the threshold to switch between the thinking and nonthinking modes ensures bounded performance loss in a distribution-free manner. Our comprehensive experiments on reasoning benchmarks show that the proposed method can save computational budgets and control the user-specified performance loss.

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly competitive in providing personalized healthcare advice, even outperforming professionals in some cases. They offer the potential for widely accessible healthcare support, especially in low-resource settings. However, evaluations of LLM-generated medical advice often overlook social disparities and biases that may affect the quality of advice provided to different social groups. A study analyzed LLM responses to medical questions posed by various patient profiles differing in sex, age range, and ethnicity. Results showed that LLM-generated advice varied systematically between social groups, with Indigenous and intersex patients receiving less readable and more complex advice. These disparities were amplified when considering intersectional groups. Given the growing reliance on LLMs for medical advice, there is a pressing need for increased AI literacy and further investigation by developers to address and mitigate these systemic differences to ensure equitable patient care. <div>

Abstract: With the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), the general public now has easy and affordable access to applications capable of answering most health-related questions in a personalized manner. These LLMs are increasingly proving to be competitive, and now even surpass professionals in some medical capabilities. They hold particular promise in low-resource settings, considering they provide the possibility of widely accessible, quasi-free healthcare support. However, evaluations that fuel these motivations highly lack insights into the social nature of healthcare, oblivious to health disparities between social groups and to how bias may translate into LLM-generated medical advice and impact users. We provide an exploratory analysis of LLM answers to a series of medical questions spanning key clinical domains, where we simulate these questions being asked by several patient profiles that vary in sex, age range, and ethnicity. By comparing natural language features of the generated responses, we show that, when LLMs are used for medical advice generation, they generate responses that systematically differ between social groups. In particular, Indigenous and intersex patients receive advice that is less readable and more complex. We observe these trends amplify when intersectional groups are considered. Considering the increasing trust individuals place in these models, we argue for higher AI literacy and for the urgent need for investigation and mitigation by AI developers to ensure these systemic differences are diminished and do not translate to unjust patient support.

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) and large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown strong performance in natural language processing and reasoning tasks. However, their computational limits, particularly in spatial complexity, are not well understood.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong performance across natural language processing (NLP), mathematical reasoning, and programming, and recent large reasoning models (LRMs) further emphasize explicit reasoning. Yet their computational limits, particularly spatial complexity constrained by finite context windows, remain poorly understood. While recent works often focus on problems within the NP complexity class, we push the boundary by introducing a novel benchmark grounded in two PSPACE-complete regular expression (regex) problems: equivalence decision (RegexEQ) and minimization (RegexMin). PSPACE-complete problems serve as a more rigorous standard for assessing computational capacity, as their solutions require massive search space exploration. We perform a double-exponential space exploration to construct a labeled dataset of over a million regex instances with a sound filtering process to build the benchmark. We conduct extensive evaluations on 6 LLMs and 5 LRMs of varying scales, revealing common failure patterns such as verbosity and repetition. With its well-defined structure and quantitative evaluation metrics, this work presents the first empirical investigation into the spatial computational limitations of LLMs and LRMs, offering a new framework for evaluating their advanced reasoning capabilities. Our code is available at https://github.com/hyundong98/RegexPSPACE .

Abstract: This paper reviews the architecture and implementation methods of agents powered by large language models (LLMs). Motivated by the limitations of traditional LLMs in real-world tasks, the research aims to explore patterns to develop "agentic" LLMs that can automate complex tasks and bridge the performance gap with human capabilities. Key components include a perception system that converts environmental percepts into meaningful representations; a reasoning system that formulates plans, adapts to feedback, and evaluates actions through different techniques like Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought; a memory system that retains knowledge through both short-term and long-term mechanisms; and an execution system that translates internal decisions into concrete actions. This paper shows how integrating these systems leads to more capable and generalized software bots that mimic human cognitive processes for autonomous and intelligent behavior.

<div> adjustable internal representations, large language models, group sparsity penalties, attention mechanisms, interpretable

Summary: 
The article introduces a framework for training large language models with adjustable internal representations ranging from localist to distributed encodings. A key feature is the use of a locality dial to control localization without retraining the model, achieved through group sparsity penalties on attention mechanisms, anchor design, and dynamic rule injection. Mathematical proofs show that attention can concentrate on relevant blocks with low entropy and high fidelity under certain conditions. The framework allows for interpolation between interpretable and high-performance modes, catering to applications in regulated domains that necessitate transparency and capability. <div>
arXiv:2510.09338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for training large language models with continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable, efficient) encodings. The key innovation is a locality dial, a tunable parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both training and inference without requiring model retraining. This is achieved through group sparsity penalties on attention mechanisms, information-theoretic anchor design, and dynamic rule injection. We provide rigorous mathematical proofs establishing explicit threshold conditions under which attention provably concentrates on semantically relevant blocks, with exponential bounds on attention entropy and pointer fidelity. Specifically, we prove that when group sparsity penalties exceed certain threshold values, the model's attention mechanisms concentrate on semantically relevant blocks, achieving low entropy and high fidelity with negligible error. This framework enables practitioners to continuously interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes, supporting applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability.

Summary: 
This paper explores the internal mechanisms of language models in solving deductive reasoning tasks. It demonstrates that even small language models can learn underlying rules to solve such tasks instead of relying solely on statistical learning. The study provides a detailed explanation of the model's internal representations and computational circuits. The findings highlight the importance of induction heads in the implementation of rule completion and chaining steps for logical inference. This indicates that language models can exhibit rule-based reasoning capabilities, shedding light on the potential of these models in solving complex logical problems. <div>

Abstract: Recent large language models have demonstrated relevant capabilities in solving problems that require logical reasoning; however, the corresponding internal mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we show that a small language model can solve a deductive reasoning task by learning the underlying rules (rather than operating as a statistical learner). A low-level explanation of its internal representations and computational circuits is then provided. Our findings reveal that induction heads play a central role in the implementation of the rule completion and rule chaining steps involved in the logical inference required by the task.

Abstract: Constraint Programming (CP) offers an intuitive, declarative framework for modeling Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP), yet classical CP models based on successor variables cannot always deal with optional visits or insertion based heuristics. To address these limitations, this paper formalizes sequence variables within CP. Unlike the classical successor models, this computational domain handle optional visits and support insertion heuristics, including insertion-based Large Neighborhood Search. We provide a clear definition of their domain, update operations, and introduce consistency levels for constraints on this domain. An implementation is described with the underlying data structures required for integrating sequence variables into existing trail-based CP solvers. Furthermore, global constraints specifically designed for sequence variables and vehicle routing are introduced. Finally, the effectiveness of sequence variables is demonstrated by simplifying problem modeling and achieving competitive computational performance on the Dial-a-Ride Problem.

<div> autonomy, large language models, radiology, multimodal data, agent

Summary:
This review explores the potential of utilizing large language models (LLMs) to create autonomous agents in radiology, optimizing workflows and enhancing decision-making processes. LLMs have shown promise in performing individual tasks, such as information extraction and report summarization. However, their full potential can be realized by integrating external tools and feedback mechanisms to enable them to manage complex, multi-step processes. By incorporating LLM-driven agentic systems, radiology can benefit from semi-automated workflows and adaptive agents capable of handling evolving context from various information sources. The review emphasizes key applications of LLMs in radiology, discusses evaluation methods for planning and tool use, and addresses challenges like error cascades and health IT integration. Sustainable integration of LLM-driven agents has the potential to revolutionize radiology practice, improving efficiency and quality of care. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.09404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building agents, systems that perceive and act upon their environment with a degree of autonomy, has long been a focus of AI research. This pursuit has recently become vastly more practical with the emergence of large language models (LLMs) capable of using natural language to integrate information, follow instructions, and perform forms of "reasoning" and planning across a wide range of tasks. With its multimodal data streams and orchestrated workflows spanning multiple systems, radiology is uniquely suited to benefit from agents that can adapt to context and automate repetitive yet complex tasks. In radiology, LLMs and their multimodal variants have already demonstrated promising performance for individual tasks such as information extraction and report summarization. However, using LLMs in isolation underutilizes their potential to support complex, multi-step workflows where decisions depend on evolving context from multiple information sources. Equipping LLMs with external tools and feedback mechanisms enables them to drive systems that exhibit a spectrum of autonomy, ranging from semi-automated workflows to more adaptive agents capable of managing complex processes. This review examines the design of such LLM-driven agentic systems, highlights key applications, discusses evaluation methods for planning and tool use, and outlines challenges such as error cascades, tool-use efficiency, and health IT integration.

Summary:
Data lakehouses are complex environments where sensitive workloads are processed using AI-driven automation. This raises concerns about trust, correctness, and governance. The article argues that API-first, programmable lakehouses with agentic workflows provide the necessary abstractions for safe-by-design operations. By utilizing data branching and declarative environments, these lakehouses can support agents that ensure reproducibility and observability while reducing the risk of security breaches. The Bauplan case study is used to showcase how agents can operate within the lakehouse environment effectively. A proof-of-concept is presented where AI agents repair data pipelines using correctness checks inspired by proof-carrying code. This prototype demonstrates that untrusted AI agents can safely handle production data, highlighting a potential path towards a fully agentic lakehouse environment. <div>

<div> GraphMERT, neurosymbolic AI, knowledge graphs, symbolic representation, domain-specific KGs

Summary:
GraphMERT introduces a neurosymbolic model that utilizes knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance AI applications. By distilling high-quality KGs from text corpora, GraphMERT combines neural learning for abstractions with symbolic KGs for verifiable reasoning, creating a modular neurosymbolic stack. It addresses the challenges of reliable domain-specific KGs that are factual and valid by outperforming large language models in accuracy and symbolic representation. Specifically, on diabetes-related text from PubMed papers, GraphMERT achieves a 69.8% FActScore and a 68.8% ValidityScore, surpassing a baseline LLM which only scores 40.2% and 43.0% respectively. With GraphMERT's 80M parameters, it showcases superior performance in generating factually accurate and ontology-consistent KGs, demonstrating its efficiency and scalability in the neurosymbolic AI domain. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.09580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers have pursued neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI) applications for nearly three decades because symbolic components provide abstraction while neural components provide generalization. Thus, a marriage of the two components can lead to rapid advancements in AI. Yet, the field has not realized this promise since most neurosymbolic AI frameworks fail to scale. In addition, the implicit representations and approximate reasoning of neural approaches limit interpretability and trust. Knowledge graphs (KGs), a gold-standard representation of explicit semantic knowledge, can address the symbolic side. However, automatically deriving reliable KGs from text corpora has remained an open problem. We address these challenges by introducing GraphMERT, a tiny graphical encoder-only model that distills high-quality KGs from unstructured text corpora and its own internal representations. GraphMERT and its equivalent KG form a modular neurosymbolic stack: neural learning of abstractions; symbolic KGs for verifiable reasoning. GraphMERT + KG is the first efficient and scalable neurosymbolic model to achieve state-of-the-art benchmark accuracy along with superior symbolic representations relative to baselines.
  Concretely, we target reliable domain-specific KGs that are both (1) factual (with provenance) and (2) valid (ontology-consistent relations with domain-appropriate semantics). When a large language model (LLM), e.g., Qwen3-32B, generates domain-specific KGs, it falls short on reliability due to prompt sensitivity, shallow domain expertise, and hallucinated relations. On text obtained from PubMed papers on diabetes, our 80M-parameter GraphMERT yields a KG with a 69.8% FActScore; a 32B-parameter baseline LLM yields a KG that achieves only 40.2% FActScore. The GraphMERT KG also attains a higher ValidityScore of 68.8%, versus 43.0% for the LLM baseline.

arXiv:2510.09595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Competitive programming problems increasingly serve as valuable benchmarks to evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) due to their complexity and ease of verification. Yet, current coding benchmarks face limitations such as lack of exceptionally challenging problems, insufficient test case coverage, reliance on online platform APIs that limit accessibility. To address these issues, we introduce LiveOIBench, a comprehensive benchmark featuring 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level competitive programming problems, each with an average of 60 expert-designed test cases. The problems are sourced directly from 72 official Informatics Olympiads in different regions conducted between 2023 and 2025. LiveOIBench distinguishes itself through four key features: (1) meticulously curated high-quality tasks with detailed subtask rubrics and extensive private test cases; (2) direct integration of elite contestant performance data to enable informative comparison against top-performing humans; (3) planned continuous, contamination-free updates from newly released Olympiad problems; and (4) a self-contained evaluation system facilitating offline and easy-to-reproduce assessments. Benchmarking 32 popular general-purpose and reasoning LLMs, we find that GPT-5 achieves a notable 81.76th percentile, a strong result that nonetheless falls short of top human contestant performance, who usually place above 90th. In contrast, among open-weight reasoning models, GPT-OSS-120B achieves only a 60th percentile, underscoring significant capability disparities from frontier closed models. Detailed analyses indicate that robust reasoning models prioritize precise problem analysis over excessive exploration, suggesting future models should emphasize structured analysis and minimize unnecessary exploration. All data, code, and leaderboard results will be made publicly available on our website.

Abstract: We present convolutional neural network (CNN) based approaches for unsupervised multimodal subspace clustering. The proposed framework consists of three main stages - multimodal encoder, self-expressive layer, and multimodal decoder. The encoder takes multimodal data as input and fuses them to a latent space representation. The self-expressive layer is responsible for enforcing the self-expressiveness property and acquiring an affinity matrix corresponding to the data points. The decoder reconstructs the original input data. The network uses the distance between the decoder's reconstruction and the original input in its training. We investigate early, late and intermediate fusion techniques and propose three different encoders corresponding to them for spatial fusion. The self-expressive layers and multimodal decoders are essentially the same for different spatial fusion-based approaches. In addition to various spatial fusion-based methods, an affinity fusion-based network is also proposed in which the self-expressive layer corresponding to different modalities is enforced to be the same. Extensive experiments on three datasets show that the proposed methods significantly outperform the state-of-the-art multimodal subspace clustering methods.

Summary:
This research introduces a novel approach to enhance the performance of unimodal 3D convolutional neural networks for dynamic hand gesture recognition by leveraging knowledge from multiple modalities. Instead of combining different modalities explicitly, the proposed framework embeds knowledge from individual modalities into separate networks, allowing each network to achieve improved performance. The utilization of a "spatiotemporal semantic alignment" loss helps align features from different networks, while a "focal regularization parameter" is introduced to prevent negative knowledge transfer. Experimental results demonstrate that this framework enhances test time recognition accuracy of unimodal networks and achieves state-of-the-art performance on dynamic hand gesture recognition datasets. <div>

Abstract: We present an efficient approach for leveraging the knowledge from multiple modalities in training unimodal 3D convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) for the task of dynamic hand gesture recognition. Instead of explicitly combining multimodal information, which is commonplace in many state-of-the-art methods, we propose a different framework in which we embed the knowledge of multiple modalities in individual networks so that each unimodal network can achieve an improved performance. In particular, we dedicate separate networks per available modality and enforce them to collaborate and learn to develop networks with common semantics and better representations. We introduce a "spatiotemporal semantic alignment" loss (SSA) to align the content of the features from different networks. In addition, we regularize this loss with our proposed "focal regularization parameter" to avoid negative knowledge transfer. Experimental results show that our framework improves the test time recognition accuracy of unimodal networks, and provides the state-of-the-art performance on various dynamic hand gesture recognition datasets.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have emerged as a transformative technology with applications spanning robotics, virtual reality, medicine, and rehabilitation. However, existing BCI frameworks face several limitations, including a lack of stage-wise flexibility essential for experimental research, steep learning curves for researchers without programming expertise, elevated costs due to reliance on proprietary software, and a lack of all-inclusive features leading to the use of multiple external tools affecting research outcomes. To address these challenges, we present PyNoetic, a modular BCI framework designed to cater to the diverse needs of BCI research. PyNoetic is one of the very few frameworks in Python that encompasses the entire BCI design pipeline, from stimulus presentation and data acquisition to channel selection, filtering, feature extraction, artifact removal, and finally simulation and visualization. Notably, PyNoetic introduces an intuitive and end-to-end GUI coupled with a unique pick-and-place configurable flowchart for no-code BCI design, making it accessible to researchers with minimal programming experience. For advanced users, it facilitates the seamless integration of custom functionalities and novel algorithms with minimal coding, ensuring adaptability at each design stage. PyNoetic also includes a rich array of analytical tools such as machine learning models, brain-connectivity indices, systematic testing functionalities via simulation, and evaluation methods of novel paradigms. PyNoetic's strengths lie in its versatility for both offline and real-time BCI development, which streamlines the design process, allowing researchers to focus on more intricate aspects of BCI development and thus accelerate their research endeavors.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative tools for natural language understanding and user intent resolution, enabling tasks such as translation, summarization, and, increasingly, the orchestration of complex workflows. This development signifies a paradigm shift from conventional, GUI-driven user interfaces toward intuitive, language-first interaction paradigms. Rather than manually navigating applications, users can articulate their objectives in natural language, enabling LLMs to orchestrate actions across multiple applications in a dynamic and contextual manner. However, extant implementations frequently rely on cloud-based proprietary models, which introduce limitations in terms of privacy, autonomy, and scalability. For language-first interaction to become a truly robust and trusted interface paradigm, local deployment is not merely a convenience; it is an imperative. This limitation underscores the importance of evaluating the feasibility of locally deployable, open-source, and open-access LLMs as foundational components for future intent-based operating systems. In this study, we examine the capabilities of several open-source and open-access models in facilitating user intention resolution through machine assistance. A comparative analysis is conducted against OpenAI's proprietary GPT-4-based systems to assess performance in generating workflows for various user intentions. The present study offers empirical insights into the practical viability, performance trade-offs, and potential of open LLMs as autonomous, locally operable components in next-generation operating systems. The results of this study inform the broader discussion on the decentralization and democratization of AI infrastructure and point toward a future where user-device interaction becomes more seamless, adaptive, and privacy-conscious through locally embedded intelligence.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a complex, multifaceted challenge to patients, caregivers, and the healthcare system, necessitating integrated and dynamic support solutions. While artificial intelligence (AI) offers promising avenues for intervention, current applications are often siloed, addressing singular aspects of the disease such as diagnostics or caregiver support without systemic integration. This paper proposes a novel methodological framework for a comprehensive, multi-agent system (MAS) designed for holistic Alzheimer's disease management. The objective is to detail the architecture of a collaborative ecosystem of specialized AI agents, each engineered to address a distinct challenge in the AD care continuum, from caregiver support and multimodal data analysis to automated research and clinical data interpretation. The proposed framework is composed of eight specialized, interoperable agents. These agents are categorized by function: (1) Caregiver and Patient Support, (2) Data Analysis and Research, and (3) Advanced Multimodal Workflows. The methodology details the technical architecture of each agent, leveraging a suite of advanced technologies including large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and Gemini, multi-agent orchestration frameworks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for evidence-grounded responses, and specialized tools for web scraping, multimodal data processing, and in-memory database querying. This paper presents a detailed architectural blueprint for an integrated AI ecosystem for AD care. By moving beyond single-purpose tools to a collaborative, multi-agent paradigm, this framework establishes a foundation for developing more adaptive, personalized, and proactive solutions. This methodological approach aims to pave the way for future systems capable of synthesizing diverse data streams to improve patient outcomes and reduce caregiver burden.

Summary: 
- The paper introduces LadderSym, a Transformer-based method for music error detection.

Abstract: Music learners can greatly benefit from tools that accurately detect errors in their practice. Existing approaches typically compare audio recordings to music scores using heuristics or learnable models. This paper introduces \textit{LadderSym}, a novel Transformer-based method for music error detection. \textit{LadderSym} is guided by two key observations about the state-of-the-art approaches: (1) late fusion limits inter-stream alignment and cross-modality comparison capability; and (2) reliance on score audio introduces ambiguity in the frequency spectrum, degrading performance in music with concurrent notes. To address these limitations, \textit{LadderSym} introduces (1) a two-stream encoder with inter-stream alignment modules to improve audio comparison capabilities and error detection F1 scores, and (2) a multimodal strategy that leverages both audio and symbolic scores by incorporating symbolic representations as decoder prompts, reducing ambiguity and improving F1 scores. We evaluate our method on the \textit{MAESTRO-E} and \textit{CocoChorales-E} datasets by measuring the F1 score for each note category. Compared to the previous state of the art, \textit{LadderSym} more than doubles F1 for missed notes on \textit{MAESTRO-E} (26.8\% $\rightarrow$ 56.3\%) and improves extra note detection by 14.4 points (72.0\% $\rightarrow$ 86.4\%). Similar gains are observed on \textit{CocoChorales-E}. This work introduces general insights about comparison models that could inform sequence evaluation tasks for reinforcement Learning, human skill assessment, and model evaluation.

Summary:  
- The study explores the impact of spoken queries on hallucinations in multimodal language models.  
- The RePOPE-Spk benchmark is introduced, incorporating audio queries in diverse acoustic conditions.  
- Results show that hallucinations increase when queries are spoken, with error rates rising significantly.  
- Input order and query length also influence the reliability of the models.  
- Strategies like many-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning partially address the issue but are not entirely effective.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Hallucinations in vision-language models have been extensively studied using benchmarks that probe reliability in image-text settings. In contrast, the effect of spoken queries on multimodal hallucinations remains largely unexplored, despite the growing role of voice-driven interfaces. In this work, we investigate how spoken input influences hallucinations in multimodal large language models. We present RePOPE-Spk, an audio-augmented extension of the RePOPE benchmark, where queries are provided as speech under diverse acoustic conditions. Using RePOPE-Spk, we systematically evaluate both proprietary and open-source models. Experimental results show that hallucinations escalate when queries are spoken rather than written: error rates increase by 3% under clean speech and by up to 20% with environmental noise. Input order and query length further affect robustness, while strategies such as many-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning offer partial but insufficient mitigation. These findings highlight a critical and underexplored challenge, opening new directions for building reliable voice interface systems.

<div> Keywords: articulatory features, automatic speech recognition, deep learning, auxiliary task, transformer-based baselines

Summary:
Articulatory features have been underutilized in automatic speech recognition (ASR) research, particularly with deep learning models. This paper introduces a novel framework that incorporates articulatory representations as both an auxiliary task and a pseudo-input to the recognition model. By predicting articulatory features through speech inversion and incorporating them into a cross-attention module with acoustic embeddings, the proposed approach outperforms strong transformer-based baselines on the LibriSpeech dataset, especially in low-resource scenarios. These results highlight the potential benefits of reintroducing articulatory information into modern ASR architectures, suggesting that leveraging such features can lead to consistent improvements in ASR performance. The study underscores the importance of exploring alternative representations, such as articulatory features, to enhance the robustness and efficiency of ASR systems.

Abstract: Prior works have investigated the use of articulatory features as complementary representations for automatic speech recognition (ASR), but their use was largely confined to shallow acoustic models. In this work, we revisit articulatory information in the era of deep learning and propose a framework that leverages articulatory representations both as an auxiliary task and as a pseudo-input to the recognition model. Specifically, we employ speech inversion as an auxiliary prediction task, and the predicted articulatory features are injected into the model as a query stream in a cross-attention module with acoustic embeddings as keys and values. Experiments on LibriSpeech demonstrate that our approach yields consistent improvements over strong transformer-based baselines, particularly under low-resource conditions. These findings suggest that articulatory features, once sidelined in ASR research, can provide meaningful benefits when reintroduced with modern architectures.

<div> Keywords: psychological stress, speech analysis, dynamic labelling, sequential models, cross-attention

Summary:
In this research, the focus is on detecting psychological stress in speech by considering it as a dynamic and evolving phenomenon rather than a static label. The proposed approach involves a dynamic labelling strategy that refines stress annotations based on emotional states. Using cross-attention-based sequential models such as a Unidirectional LSTM and a Transformer Encoder, the temporal progression of stress is effectively captured. The results show significant improvements in accuracy on datasets like MuSE and StressID compared to existing methods. Additionally, the approach demonstrates good generalization capabilities on a custom real-world dataset. This study emphasizes the importance of treating stress as a dynamic construct in speech analysis, showcasing the potential for more accurate and nuanced stress detection techniques.

Abstract: Detecting psychological stress from speech is critical in high-pressure settings. While prior work has leveraged acoustic features for stress detection, most treat stress as a static label. In this work, we model stress as a temporally evolving phenomenon influenced by historical emotional state. We propose a dynamic labelling strategy that derives fine-grained stress annotations from emotional labels and introduce cross-attention-based sequential models, a Unidirectional LSTM and a Transformer Encoder, to capture temporal stress progression. Our approach achieves notable accuracy gains on MuSE (+5%) and StressID (+18%) over existing baselines, and generalises well to a custom real-world dataset. These results highlight the value of modelling stress as a dynamic construct in speech.

<br />
Summary:
EGSTalker is a real-time audio-driven talking head generation framework that uses 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to synthesize high-quality facial animations. It requires only a short training video to create realistic facial movements. The framework consists of static Gaussian initialization and audio-driven deformation stages. Spatial features are extracted using a multi-resolution hash triplane and a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for constructing a 3D Gaussian representation. An Efficient Spatial-Audio Attention (ESAA) module fuses audio and spatial cues, while KAN predicts Gaussian deformations. EGSTalker achieves high rendering quality and lip-sync accuracy similar to state-of-the-art methods but surpasses them in speed. This framework has the potential for real-time multimedia applications. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: This paper presents EGSTalker, a real-time audio-driven talking head generation framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Designed to enhance both speed and visual fidelity, EGSTalker requires only 3-5 minutes of training video to synthesize high-quality facial animations. The framework comprises two key stages: static Gaussian initialization and audio-driven deformation. In the first stage, a multi-resolution hash triplane and a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) are used to extract spatial features and construct a compact 3D Gaussian representation. In the second stage, we propose an Efficient Spatial-Audio Attention (ESAA) module to fuse audio and spatial cues, while KAN predicts the corresponding Gaussian deformations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EGSTalker achieves rendering quality and lip-sync accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods, while significantly outperforming them in inference speed. These results highlight EGSTalker's potential for real-time multimedia applications.

Summary: 
This study compares fine-tuned traditional CNNs, zero-shot pre-trained multi-modal LLMs, and fine-tuned multi-modal LLMs for text overlay detection in images. The research shows that fine-tuned LLMs can achieve significant accuracy improvement with minimal data, outperforming CNN-based models. By adapting language-guided models for precise visual understanding with limited supervision, the study contributes to the integration of vision and language. The findings highlight the adaptability and efficiency of LLM-based approaches for object detection tasks, particularly in low-resource environments. The code used for model fine-tuning is made available on GitHub for further research and application. <div>

Abstract: The field of object detection and understanding is rapidly evolving, driven by advances in both traditional CNN-based models and emerging multi-modal large language models (LLMs). While CNNs like ResNet and YOLO remain highly effective for image-based tasks, recent transformer-based LLMs introduce new capabilities such as dynamic context reasoning, language-guided prompts, and holistic scene understanding. However, when used out-of-the-box, the full potential of LLMs remains underexploited, often resulting in suboptimal performance on specialized visual tasks. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison of fine-tuned traditional CNNs, zero-shot pre-trained multi-modal LLMs, and fine-tuned multi-modal LLMs on the challenging task of artificial text overlay detection in images. A key contribution of our study is demonstrating that LLMs can be effectively fine-tuned on very limited data (fewer than 1,000 images) to achieve up to 36% accuracy improvement, matching or surpassing CNN-based baselines that typically require orders of magnitude more data. By exploring how language-guided models can be adapted for precise visual understanding with minimal supervision, our work contributes to the broader effort of bridging vision and language, offering novel insights into efficient cross-modal learning strategies. These findings highlight the adaptability and data efficiency of LLM-based approaches for real-world object detection tasks and provide actionable guidance for applying multi-modal transformers in low-resource visual environments. To support continued progress in this area, we have made the code used to fine-tune the models available in our GitHub, enabling future improvements and reuse in related applications.

<title>The Enduring Dominance of Deep Neural Networks: A Critical Analysis of the Fundamental Limitations of Quantum Machine Learning and Spiking Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in QML and SNNs have generated considerable excitement, promising exponential speedups and brain-like energy efficiency to revolutionize AI. However, this paper argues that they are unlikely to displace DNNs in the near term. QML struggles with adapting backpropagation due to unitary constraints, measurement-induced state collapse, barren plateaus, and high measurement overheads, exacerbated by the limitations of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware, overfitting risks due to underdeveloped regularization techniques, and a fundamental misalignment with machine learning's generalization. SNNs face restricted representational bandwidth, struggling with long-range dependencies and semantic encoding in language tasks due to their discrete, spike-based processing. Furthermore, the goal of faithfully emulating the brain might impose inherent inefficiencies like cognitive biases, limited working memory, and slow learning speeds. Even their touted energy-efficient advantages are overstated; optimized DNNs with quantization can outperform SNNs in energy costs under realistic conditions. Finally, SNN training incurs high computational overhead from temporal unfolding. In contrast, DNNs leverage efficient backpropagation, robust regularization, and innovations in LRMs that shift scaling to inference-time compute, enabling self-improvement via RL and search algorithms like MCTS while mitigating data scarcity. This superiority is evidenced by recent models such as xAI's Grok-4 Heavy, which advances SOTA performance, and gpt-oss-120b, which surpasses or approaches the performance of leading industry models despite its modest 120-billion-parameter size deployable on a single 80GB GPU. Furthermore, specialized ASICs amplify these efficiency gains. Ultimately, QML and SNNs may serve niche hybrid roles, but DNNs remain the dominant, practical paradigm for AI advancement.

<title>Less Diverse, Less Safe: The Indirect But Pervasive Risk of Test-Time Scaling in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves LLM reasoning by exploring multiple candidate responses and then operating over this set to find the best output. A tacit premise behind TTS is that sufficiently diverse candidate pools enhance reliability. In this work, we show that this assumption in TTS introduces a previously unrecognized failure mode. When candidate diversity is curtailed, even by a modest amount, TTS becomes much more likely to produce unsafe outputs. We present a reference-guided diversity reduction protocol (RefDiv) that serves as a diagnostic attack to stress test TTS pipelines. Through extensive experiments across four open-source models (Qwen3, Mistral, Llama3.1, Gemma3) and two widely used TTS strategies (Monte Carlo Tree Search and Best-of-N), constraining diversity consistently signifies the rate at which TTS produces unsafe results. The effect is often stronger than that produced by prompts directly with high adversarial intent scores. This observed phenomenon also transfers across TTS strategies and to closed-source models (e.g. OpenAI o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro), thus indicating that this is a general and extant property of TTS rather than a model-specific artifact. Additionally, we find that numerous widely used safety guardrail classifiers (e.g. Llama-Guard and OpenAI Moderation API), are unable to flag the adversarial input prompts generated by RefDiv, demonstrating that existing defenses offer limited protection against this diversity-driven failure mode. Through this work, we hope to motivate future research on designing robust TTS strategies that are both effective and secure against diversity-targeted stress tests as illustrated by RefDiv.

<title>Hierarchical Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Depression Detection from Speech</title>

Abstract: Speech-based depression detection (SDD) is a promising, non-invasive alternative to traditional clinical assessments. However, it remains limited by the difficulty of extracting meaningful features and capturing sparse, heterogeneous depressive cues over time. Pretrained self-supervised learning (SSL) models such as WavLM provide rich, multi-layer speech representations, yet most existing SDD methods rely only on the final layer or search for a single best-performing one. These approaches often overfit to specific datasets and fail to leverage the full hierarchical structure needed to detect subtle and persistent depression signals.
  To address this challenge, we propose HAREN-CTC, a novel architecture that integrates multi-layer SSL features using cross-attention within a multitask learning framework, combined with Connectionist Temporal Classification loss to handle sparse temporal supervision. HAREN-CTC comprises two key modules: a Hierarchical Adaptive Clustering module that reorganizes SSL features into complementary embeddings, and a Cross-Modal Fusion module that models inter-layer dependencies through cross-attention. The CTC objective enables alignment-aware training, allowing the model to track irregular temporal patterns of depressive speech cues.
  We evaluate HAREN-CTC under both an upper-bound setting with standard data splits and a generalization setting using five-fold cross-validation. The model achieves state-of-the-art macro F1-scores of 0.81 on DAIC-WOZ and 0.82 on MODMA, outperforming prior methods across both evaluation scenarios.

Abstract: Pruning large pre-trained transformers for low-resource languages is challenging, as it often requires massive retraining data to recover performance. For instance, Distill-Whisper prunes Whisper by 40% and retrains on 21,000 hours of speech, far beyond what is available for most languages. Can Whisper be made lighter and faster for edge devices in data-scarce settings? Focusing on Bambara with only 32h of speech-to-text data, we propose a new pruning recipe. Instead of vocabulary pruning, which is unsuitable due to frequent code-switching by Bambara speakers, we compress the embeddings with low-rank decomposition and feature distillation. Rather than removing layers, we merge them to limit performance loss. The final model preserves 90% of the original performance while being 48% smaller and 2.15x faster on a MacBook Air M1.

Abstract: Inference optimizations such as quantization, pruning, format and datatype conversion, model export, and serialization can lead to functional degradations in language model task performance. While most efforts on performance recovery for deployment focus on robust quantization techniques, we focus on recovering model accuracies from any sources that degrade model weights, such as improper model serialization. In this work, we propose Recover-LoRA, a lightweight and dataset agnostic method to recover accuracy in degraded models. Recover-LoRA uses synthetic data and logit distillation to learn LoRA adapters on selective layers that facilitate aligning the degraded model to its full precision model. We investigate the utility of Recover-LoRA across a diverse set of small language models (SLMs), including models with varying attention architectures, multi-head attention (MHA) and group-query attention (GQA), as well as several evaluation datasets. Our results show that Recover-LoRA recovers model accuracies by 5-17% on MHA and GQA SLMs.

Abstract: Long-term memory is essential for natural, realistic dialogue. However, current large language model (LLM) memory systems rely on either brute-force context expansion or static retrieval pipelines that fail on edge-constrained devices. We introduce Mnemosyne, an unsupervised, human-inspired long-term memory architecture designed for edge-based LLMs. Our approach uses graph-structured storage, modular substance and redundancy filters, memory committing and pruning mechanisms, and probabilistic recall with temporal decay and refresh processes modeled after human memory. Mnemosyne also introduces a concentrated "core summary" efficiently derived from a fixed-length subset of the memory graph to capture the user's personality and other domain-specific long-term details such as, using healthcare application as an example, post-recovery ambitions and attitude towards care. Unlike existing retrieval-augmented methods, Mnemosyne is designed for use in longitudinal healthcare assistants, where repetitive and semantically similar but temporally distinct conversations are limited by naive retrieval. In experiments with longitudinal healthcare dialogues, Mnemosyne demonstrates the highest win rate of 65.8% in blind human evaluations of realism and long-term memory capability compared to a baseline RAG win rate of 31.1%. Mnemosyne also achieves current highest LoCoMo benchmark scores in temporal reasoning and single-hop retrieval compared to other same-backboned techniques. Further, the average overall score of 54.6% was second highest across all methods, beating commonly used Mem0 and OpenAI baselines among others. This demonstrates that improved factual recall, enhanced temporal reasoning, and much more natural user-facing responses can be feasible with an edge-compatible and easily transferable unsupervised memory architecture.

Abstract: Jailbreaks are adversarial attacks designed to bypass the built-in safety mechanisms of large language models. Automated jailbreaks typically optimize an adversarial suffix or adapt long prompt templates by forcing the model to generate the initial part of a restricted or harmful response. In this work, we show that existing jailbreak attacks that leverage such mechanisms to unlock the model response can be detected by a straightforward perplexity-based filtering on the input prompt. To overcome this issue, we propose LatentBreak, a white-box jailbreak attack that generates natural adversarial prompts with low perplexity capable of evading such defenses. LatentBreak substitutes words in the input prompt with semantically-equivalent ones, preserving the initial intent of the prompt, instead of adding high-perplexity adversarial suffixes or long templates. These words are chosen by minimizing the distance in the latent space between the representation of the adversarial prompt and that of harmless requests. Our extensive evaluation shows that LatentBreak leads to shorter and low-perplexity prompts, thus outperforming competing jailbreak algorithms against perplexity-based filters on multiple safety-aligned models.

In particular, we investigate language-switching across English, French, Spanish, Arabic, Hindi, and Chinese, followed by translation. We also study query length inflation preceding summarization and structural reformatting into multiple-choice questions. In this paper, we present a multilingual, multi-agent large language model framework with retrieval-augmented generation that can be deployed as a web plugin into online platforms. Our work underscores the importance of AI-driven misinformation detection in safeguarding online factual integrity against diverse attacks, while showcasing the feasibility of plugin-based deployment for real-world web applications.

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) is hard because discriminative evidence is sparse, localized, and often asynchronous across modalities. We center ERC on emotion hotspots and present a unified model that detects per-utterance hotspots in text, audio, and video, fuses them with global features via Hotspot-Gated Fusion, and aligns modalities using a routed Mixture-of-Aligners; a cross-modal graph encodes conversational structure. This design focuses modeling on salient spans, mitigates misalignment, and preserves context. Experiments on standard ERC benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, with ablations confirming the contributions of HGF and MoA. Our results point to a hotspot-centric view that can inform future multimodal learning, offering a new perspective on modality fusion in ERC.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now used worldwide, yet their multimodal understanding and reasoning often degrade outside Western, high-resource settings. We propose MMA-ASIA, a comprehensive framework to evaluate LLMs' cultural awareness with a focus on Asian contexts. MMA-ASIA centers on a human-curated, multilingual, and multimodally aligned multiple-choice benchmark covering 8 Asian countries and 10 languages, comprising 27,000 questions; over 79 percent require multi-step reasoning grounded in cultural context, moving beyond simple memorization. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset aligned at the input level across three modalities: text, image (visual question answering), and speech. This enables direct tests of cross-modal transfer. Building on this benchmark, we propose a five-dimensional evaluation protocol that measures: (i) cultural-awareness disparities across countries, (ii) cross-lingual consistency, (iii) cross-modal consistency, (iv) cultural knowledge generalization, and (v) grounding validity. To ensure rigorous assessment, a Cultural Awareness Grounding Validation Module detects "shortcut learning" by checking whether the requisite cultural knowledge supports correct answers. Finally, through comparative model analysis, attention tracing, and an innovative Vision-ablated Prefix Replay (VPR) method, we probe why models diverge across languages and modalities, offering actionable insights for building culturally reliable multimodal LLMs.

Abstract: Code completion can help developers improve efficiency and ease the development lifecycle. Although code completion is available in modern integrated development environments (IDEs), research lacks in determining what makes a good context for code completion based on the information available to the IDEs for the large language models (LLMs) to perform better. In this paper, we describe an effective context collection strategy to assist the LLMs in performing better at code completion tasks. The key idea of our strategy is to preprocess the repository into smaller code chunks and later use syntactic and semantic similarity-based code chunk retrieval with relative positioning. We found that code chunking and relative positioning of the chunks in the final context improve the performance of code completion tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into software development processes, with the potential to transform team workflows and productivity. This paper investigates how LLMs affect team collaboration throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). We reframe and update a prior study with recent developments as of 2025, incorporating new literature and case studies. We outline the problem of collaboration hurdles in SDLC and explore how LLMs can enhance productivity, communication, and decision-making in a team context. Through literature review, industry examples, a team survey, and two case studies, we assess the impact of LLM-assisted tools (such as code generation assistants and AI-powered project management agents) on collaborative software engineering practices. Our findings indicate that LLMs can significantly improve efficiency (by automating repetitive tasks and documentation), enhance communication clarity, and aid cross-functional collaboration, while also introducing new challenges like model limitations and privacy concerns. We discuss these benefits and challenges, present research questions guiding the investigation, evaluate threats to validity, and suggest future research directions including domain-specific model customization, improved integration into development tools, and robust strategies for ensuring trust and security.

<title>From What to Why: Thought-Space Recommendation with Small Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced recommendation capabilities through enhanced reasoning, but pose significant challenges for real-world deployment due to high inference costs. Conversely, while Small Language Models (SLMs) offer an efficient alternative, their reasoning capabilities for recommendation remain underexplored. Existing systems often use natural language rationales merely as unsupervised descriptive text, failing to harness their full potential as learning signals. In this work our main idea is to create a common understanding of user and items across multiple domains called Thought Space with SLMs instead of using LLMs' distilled knowledge. To that end we propose PULSE (Preference Understanding by Latent Semantic Embeddings), a framework that treats SLM-generated rationales as director learning signals, supervising them with interaction histories to jointly model user actions (what) and their semantic drivers (why). Existing methods consider only interactions such as sequences and embeddings, whereas PULSE treats rationales as first-class signals, this novel design yields embeddings that are more robust and generalizable. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PULSE outperforms leading ID, Collaborative Filtering (CF), and LLM-based sequential recommendation models across multiple benchmark datasets. Furthermore, PULSE exhibits superior transferability in cross-domain recommendation and demonstrates strong performance on downstream tasks such as reasoning-oriented question answering. Our code is available \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Thinking_PULSE-0FC5/README.md}{here}.

Abstract: Within Human Activity Recognition (HAR), there is an insurmountable gap between the range of activities performed in life and those that can be captured in an annotated sensor dataset used in training. Failure to properly handle unseen activities seriously undermines any HAR classifier's reliability. Additionally within HAR, not all classes are equally dissimilar, some significantly overlap or encompass other sub-activities. Based on these observations, we arrange activity classes into a structured hierarchy. From there, we propose Hi-OSCAR: a Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Activity Recognition, that can identify known activities at state-of-the-art accuracy while simultaneously rejecting unknown activities. This not only enables open-set classification, but also allows for unknown classes to be localized to the nearest internal node, providing insight beyond a binary "known/unknown" classification. To facilitate this and future open-set HAR research, we collected a new dataset: NFI_FARED. NFI_FARED contains data from multiple subjects performing nineteen activities from a range of contexts, including daily living, commuting, and rapid movements, which is fully public and available for download.

<title>Into the Rabbit Hull: From Task-Relevant Concepts in DINO to Minkowski Geometry</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08638</link>

Abstract: DINOv2 is routinely deployed to recognize objects, scenes, and actions; yet the nature of what it perceives remains unknown. As a working baseline, we adopt the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) and operationalize it using SAEs, producing a 32,000-unit dictionary that serves as the interpretability backbone of our study, which unfolds in three parts.
  In the first part, we analyze how different downstream tasks recruit concepts from our learned dictionary, revealing functional specialization: classification exploits "Elsewhere" concepts that fire everywhere except on target objects, implementing learned negations; segmentation relies on boundary detectors forming coherent subspaces; depth estimation draws on three distinct monocular depth cues matching visual neuroscience principles.
  Following these functional results, we analyze the geometry and statistics of the concepts learned by the SAE. We found that representations are partly dense rather than strictly sparse. The dictionary evolves toward greater coherence and departs from maximally orthogonal ideals (Grassmannian frames). Within an image, tokens occupy a low dimensional, locally connected set persisting after removing position. These signs suggest representations are organized beyond linear sparsity alone.
  Synthesizing these observations, we propose a refined view: tokens are formed by combining convex mixtures of archetypes (e.g., a rabbit among animals, brown among colors, fluffy among textures). This structure is grounded in Gardenfors' conceptual spaces and in the model's mechanism as multi-head attention produces sums of convex mixtures, defining regions bounded by archetypes. We introduce the Minkowski Representation Hypothesis (MRH) and examine its empirical signatures and implications for interpreting vision-transformer representations.

<title>Automating Android Build Repair: Bridging the Reasoning-Execution Gap in LLM Agents with Domain-Specific Tools</title>

Abstract: Android is the largest mobile platform, yet automatically building applications remains a practical challenge. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for code repair, their use for fixing Android build errors remains underexplored. To address this gap, we first introduce AndroidBuildBench, a benchmark of 1,019 build failures curated from the commit histories of 43 open-source Android projects. Each problem is paired with a verified solution from a subsequent commit, ensuring that fixes are feasible. Second, we propose GradleFixer, an LLM agent with domain-specific tools for inspecting and manipulating the Gradle build environment. GradleFixer achieves a resolve rate of 81.4% (pass@1), significantly outperforming a state-of-the-art coding agent that relies on a general-purpose shell. GradleFixer's success suggests that while LLMs possess the high-level knowledge to solve these failures, they struggle to translate this knowledge into effective low-level actions using a general-purpose shell. We demonstrate the effectiveness of a strategy we term Tool Bridging, which replaces general-purpose shell commands with domain-aware abstractions. We hypothesize this approach works through two mechanisms: 1) it provides tools in an API-like format that LLMs use more reliably, and 2) it constrains the action space to relevant operations. This approach bridges the gap between the model's high-level reasoning and effective low-level execution.

<title>Energy-Driven Steering: Reducing False Refusals in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) faces a key challenge: current alignment techniques often only focus on improving safety against harmful prompts, causing LLMs to become over-cautious and refuse to respond to benign prompts. Therefore, a key objective of safe alignment is to enhance safety while simultaneously reducing false refusals. In this paper, we introduce Energy-Driven Steering (EDS), a novel, fine-tuning free framework designed to resolve this challenge through dynamic, inference-time intervention. We trained a lightweight, external Energy-Based Model (EBM) to assign high energy to undesirable (false refusal or jailbreak) states and low energy to desirable (helpful response or safe reject) ones. During inference, EBM maps the LLM's internal activations to an "energy landscape". We use the gradient of the energy function to dynamically steer the LLM's hidden states to low energy regions, correcting the model to generate a desirable response in real-time without modifying its weights. This method decouples behavioral control from the model's core knowledge, offering a flexible solution with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across a wide range of models show our method successfully achieves this objective: it substantially lowers false refusal rates. For example, raising compliance on the ORB-H benchmark from 57.3% to 82.6% while maintaining the baseline safety performance. Our work presents an effective paradigm for building LLMs that achieve both low false refusal rates and high safety.

Abstract: Recent developments have enabled advanced reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) via long Chain-of-Thought (CoT), while long CoT suffers from high computational costs and significant latency losses owing to the autoregressive nature of generative LLMs. CoT compression aims to improve efficiency in the reasoning process by reducing output length. Previous works trade reasoning efficiency by either laborious discrete prompt designing or the construction of external compressed CoT datasets that sacrifice key reasoning details. In this work, we propose Upfront CoT (UCoT): an efficient reasoning framework with upfront thought embedding to automate CoT compression. UCoT is a cooperative workflow involving a small model (compressor) and a large model (executor). The first stage of UCoT trains compressor to generate upfront thought embeddings rich in reasoning information for the executor, avoiding the drawbacks of manually designed prompts. The second stage optimizes executor to utilize upfront thought embeddings to derive the correct answer with short reasoning, using a reward mechanism. Extensive experiments show that UCoT maintains the powerful reasoning ability of executor while significantly reducing the length of CoT. It is worth mentioning that when applying UCoT to the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model, the usage of tokens on GSM8K dataset is reduced by 50\%, while the performance is 3.08\% higher than that of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method. The code and dataset are in supplementary material.

Abstract: Large language models can change answers under harmless edits that matter in practice: RAG outputs flip when passages are reordered, fine-tuning erodes invariances learned at pretraining, debate or chain-of-thought prompts take path-dependent routes, and compiler fusion or reordering perturbs logits near decision boundaries. These failures violate intended invariances, break continuous integration, and force teams to trade safety for speed. The effects are small yet distributed across layers and positions, sensitive to context length and evaluation order, and costly to repair with retraining or formal verification. We present WILSON, a minimal post-hoc diagnostic suite that converts simple loop and reordering checks on internal representations into system signals. WILSON combines an inverse-free curvature map over positions and layers, computed with JVPs and Hutchinson probes, with activation-level commutators that flag reorder risk. Signals are cheap to compute, model-agnostic for standard Transformers, and exported as thresholds and CSV artifacts for orchestrators. This enables concrete actions: guard RAG against order effects, catch fine-tuning regressions, stabilize debate pathways and long multi-turn contexts, and gate fusions or reorders in deployment. In short, WILSON helps anticipate failures and approve safe optimizations so reliability and throughput can improve together without changing model architecture or training.

Abstract: Personal narratives are stories authors construct to make meaning of their experiences. Style, the distinctive way authors use language to express themselves, is fundamental to how these narratives convey subjective experiences. Yet there is a lack of a formal framework for systematically analyzing these stylistic choices. We present a novel approach that formalizes style in personal narratives as patterns in the linguistic choices authors make when communicating subjective experiences. Our framework integrates three domains: functional linguistics establishes language as a system of meaningful choices, computer science provides methods for automatically extracting and analyzing sequential patterns, and these patterns are linked to psychological observations. Using language models, we automatically extract linguistic features such as processes, participants, and circumstances. We apply our framework to hundreds of dream narratives, including a case study on a war veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder. Analysis of his narratives uncovers distinctive patterns, particularly how verbal processes dominate over mental ones, illustrating the relationship between linguistic choices and psychological states.

Abstract: Rare genetic disease diagnosis faces critical challenges: insufficient patient data, inaccessible full genome sequencing, and the immense number of possible causative genes. These limitations cause prolonged diagnostic journeys, inappropriate treatments, and critical delays, disproportionately affecting patients in resource-limited settings where diagnostic tools are scarce. We propose RareNet, a subgraph-based Graph Neural Network that requires only patient phenotypes to identify the most likely causal gene and retrieve focused patient subgraphs for targeted clinical investigation. RareNet can function as a standalone method or serve as a pre-processing or post-processing filter for other candidate gene prioritization methods, consistently enhancing their performance while potentially enabling explainable insights. Through comprehensive evaluation on two biomedical datasets, we demonstrate competitive and robust causal gene prediction and significant performance gains when integrated with other frameworks. By requiring only phenotypic data, which is readily available in any clinical setting, RareNet democratizes access to sophisticated genetic analysis, offering particular value for underserved populations lacking advanced genomic infrastructure.

Abstract: Recent advancements in AI-driven 3D model generation have leveraged cross modality, yet generating models with smooth surfaces and minimizing storage overhead remain challenges. This paper introduces a novel multi-stage framework for generating 3D models composed of parameterized primitives, guided by textual and image inputs. In the framework, A model generation algorithm based on parameterized primitives, is proposed, which can identifies the shape features of the model constituent elements, and replace the elements with parameterized primitives with high quality surface. In addition, a corresponding model storage method is proposed, it can ensure the original surface quality of the model, while retaining only the parameters of parameterized primitives. Experiments on virtual scene dataset and real scene dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a Chamfer Distance of 0.003092, a VIoU of 0.545, a F1-Score of 0.9139 and a NC of 0.8369, with primitive parameter files approximately 6KB in size. Our approach is particularly suitable for rapid prototyping of simple models.

Abstract: Real-world time series are influenced by numerous factors and exhibit complex non-stationary characteristics. Non-stationarity can lead to distribution shifts, where the statistical properties of time series change over time, negatively impacting model performance. Several instance normalization techniques have been proposed to address distribution shifts in time series forecasting. However, existing methods fail to account for shifts within individual instances, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle inner-instance distribution shifts, we propose two novel point-level methods: Learning Distribution (LD) and Learning Conditional Distribution (LCD). LD eliminates internal discrepancies by fitting the internal distribution of input and output with different parameters at different time steps, while LCD utilizes neural networks to predict scaling coefficients of the output. We evaluate the performance of the two methods with various backbone models across public benchmarks and demonstrate the effectiveness of the point-level paradigm through comparative experiments.

Abstract: Language-empowered foundation models (LeFMs), such as CLIP and GraphCLIP, have transformed multimodal learning by aligning visual (or graph) features with textual representations, enabling powerful downstream capabilities like few-shot learning. However, the reliance on small, task-specific support datasets collected in open environments exposes these models to poisoning attacks, where adversaries manipulate the support samples to degrade performance. Existing defenses rely on empirical strategies, which lack formal guarantees and remain vulnerable to unseen and adaptive attacks. Certified robustness offers provable guarantees but has been largely unexplored for few-shot classifiers based on LeFMs. This study seeks to fill these critical gaps by proposing the first provably robust few-shot classifier that is tailored for LeFMs. We term our model Language-empowered Few-shot Certification (\textbf{LeFCert}). It integrates both textual and feature embeddings with an adaptive blending mechanism. To achieve provable robustness, we propose a twofold trimmed mean prototype and derive provable upper and lower bounds for classification scores, enabling certification under worst-case poisoning scenarios. To further enhance the performance, we extend LeFCert with two variants by considering a more realistic and tighter attack budget: LeFCert-L incorporates randomized smoothing to provide Lipschitz continuity and derive robustness under dual budget constraints, and LeFCert-C provides collective certification for scenarios where attackers distribute a shared poisoning budget across multiple samples. Experiments demonstrate that LeFCert achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving both clean and certified accuracy compared to existing baselines. Despite its advanced robustness mechanisms, LeFCert is computationally efficient, making it practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Recent research demonstrates that linear models achieve forecasting performance competitive with complex architectures, yet methodologies for enhancing linear models remain underexplored. Motivated by the hypothesis that distinct time series instances may follow heterogeneous linear mappings, we propose the Classification Auxiliary Trend-Seasonal Decoupling Linear Model CATS-Linear, employing Classification Auxiliary Channel-Independence (CACI). CACI dynamically routes instances to dedicated predictors via classification, enabling supervised channel design. We further analyze the theoretical expected risks of different channel settings. Additionally, we redesign the trend-seasonal decomposition architecture by adding a decoupling -- linear mapping -- recoupling framework for trend components and complex-domain linear projections for seasonal components. Extensive experiments validate that CATS-Linear with fixed hyperparameters achieves state-of-the-art accuracy comparable to hyperparameter-tuned baselines while delivering SOTA accuracy against fixed-hyperparameter counterparts.

Abstract: Genomic Selection (GS) uses whole-genome information to predict crop phenotypes and accelerate breeding. Traditional GS methods, however, struggle with prediction accuracy for complex traits and large datasets. We propose DPCformer, a deep learning model integrating convolutional neural networks with a self-attention mechanism to model complex genotype-phenotype relationships. We applied DPCformer to 13 traits across five crops (maize, cotton, tomato, rice, chickpea). Our approach uses an 8-dimensional one-hot encoding for SNP data, ordered by chromosome, and employs the PMF algorithm for feature selection. Evaluations show DPCformer outperforms existing methods. In maize datasets, accuracy for traits like days to tasseling and plant height improved by up to 2.92%. For cotton, accuracy gains for fiber traits reached 8.37%. On small-sample tomato data, the Pearson Correlation Coefficient for a key trait increased by up to 57.35%. In chickpea, the yield correlation was boosted by 16.62%. DPCformer demonstrates superior accuracy, robustness in small-sample scenarios, and enhanced interpretability, providing a powerful tool for precision breeding and addressing global food security challenges.

Abstract: Psychological assessments typically rely on structured rating scales, which cannot incorporate the rich nuance of a respondent's natural language. This study leverages recent LLM advances to harness qualitative data within a novel conceptual framework, combining LLM-scored text and traditional rating-scale items to create an augmented test. We demonstrate this approach using depression as a case study, developing and assessing the framework on a real-world sample of upper secondary students (n=693) and corresponding synthetic dataset (n=3,000). On held-out test sets, augmented tests achieved statistically significant improvements in measurement precision and accuracy. The information gain from the LLM items was equivalent to adding between 6.3 (real data) and 16.0 (synthetic data) items to the original 19-item test. Our approach marks a conceptual shift in automated scoring that bypasses its typical bottlenecks: instead of relying on pre-labelled data or complex expert-created rubrics, we empirically select the most informative LLM scoring instructions based on calculations of item information. This framework provides a scalable approach for leveraging the growing stream of transcribed text to enhance traditional psychometric measures, and we discuss its potential utility in clinical health and beyond.

Abstract: LLM-based RTL generation is an interesting research direction, as it holds the potential to liberate the least automated stage in the current chip design. However, due to the substantial semantic gap between high-level specifications and RTL, coupled with limited training data, existing models struggle with generation accuracy. Drawing on human experience, design with verification helps improving accuracy. However, as the RTL testbench data are even more scarce, it is not friendly for LLMs. Although LLMs excel at higher-level languages like Python/C, they have a huge semantic gap from RTL. When implementing the same functionality, Python/C code and hardware code differ significantly in the spatiotemporal granularity, requiring the LLM not only to consider high-level functional semantics but also to ensure the low-level details align with the circuit code. It is not an easy task. In this paper, we propose a function abstracted verifiable middleware (Faver) that streamlines RTL verification in LLM-based workflows. By mixing LLM-friendly code structures with a rule-based template, Faver decouples the details of circuit verification, allowing the LLM to focus on the functionality itself. In our experiments on the SFT model and open-source models, Faver improved the model's generation accuracy by up to 14%.

<title>RA-Gen: A Controllable Code Generation Framework Using ReAct for Multi-Agent Task Execution</title>

Abstract: Code generation models based on large language models (LLMs) have gained wide adoption, but challenges remain in ensuring safety, accuracy, and controllability, especially for complex tasks. Existing methods often lack dynamic integration of external tools, transparent reasoning, and user control over safety. To address these issues, we propose a controllable code generation framework utilizing the ReAct paradigm for multi-agent task execution. This framework is a multi-agent system designed to enable efficient, precise, and interpretable code generation through dynamic interactions between LLMs and external resources. The framework adopts a collaborative architecture comprising four specialized agents: a Planner for task decomposition, a Searcher that leverages the ReAct framework for reasoning and tool integration, a CodeGen agent for accurate code generation, and an Extractor for structured data retrieval. The ReAct-based Searcher alternates between generating reasoning traces and executing actions, facilitating seamless integration of internal knowledge with external tools (such as search engines) to enhance accuracy and user control. Experimental results show the framework's effectiveness across multiple languages, achieving a 94.8% security rate on the SVEN dataset with CodeQL, outperforming existing approaches. Its transparent reasoning process fosters user trust and improves controllability.

<title>dInfer: An Efficient Inference Framework for Diffusion Language Models</title>

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs, leveraging denoising-based generation to enable inherent parallelism. Even more and more open-sourced dLLM models emerge, yet their widespread adoption remains constrained by the lack of a standardized and efficient inference framework. We present dInfer, an efficient and extensible framework for dLLM inference. dInfer decomposes the inference pipeline into four modular components-model, diffusion iteration manager, decoding strategy, and KV-cache manager-and integrates novel algorithms for each component alongside system-level optimizations. Through this combination of algorithmic innovations and system enhancements, dInfer achieves substantial efficiency gains without compromising output quality on LLaDA-MoE. At batch size 1, it surpasses 1,100 tokens per second on HumanEval and averages over 800 tokens per second across six benchmarks on $8\times$ H800 GPUs. Compared to prior systems, dInfer delivers $10\times$ speedup over Fast-dLLM while maintaining similar model performance. Even compared with AR models (with a comparable number of activation parameters and performance) QWen2.5-3B, which is highly optimized with latest vLLM inference engine, dInfer still deliverers $2$-$3\times$ speedup. The implementation of dInfer is open-sourced at https://github.com/inclusionAI/dInfer.

Abstract: Modern software teams frequently encounter delays in resolving recurring or related issues due to fragmented knowledge scattered across JIRA tickets, developer discussions, and GitHub pull requests (PRs). To address this challenge, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that integrates Sentence-Transformers for semantic embeddings with FAISS-based vector search to deliver context-aware ticket resolution recommendations. The approach embeds historical JIRA tickets, user comments, and linked PR metadata to retrieve semantically similar past cases, which are then synthesized by a Large Language Model (LLM) into grounded and explainable resolution suggestions. The framework contributes a unified pipeline linking JIRA and GitHub data, an embedding and FAISS indexing strategy for heterogeneous software artifacts, and a resolution generation module guided by retrieved evidence. Experimental evaluation using precision, recall, resolution time reduction, and developer acceptance metrics shows that the proposed system significantly improves resolution accuracy, fix quality, and knowledge reuse in modern DevOps environments.

<title>FreqCa: Accelerating Diffusion Models via Frequency-Aware Caching</title>

Abstract: The application of diffusion transformers is suffering from their significant inference costs. Recently, feature caching has been proposed to solve this problem by reusing features from previous timesteps, thereby skipping computation in future timesteps. However, previous feature caching assumes that features in adjacent timesteps are similar or continuous, which does not always hold in all settings. To investigate this, this paper begins with an analysis from the frequency domain, which reveal that different frequency bands in the features of diffusion models exhibit different dynamics across timesteps. Concretely, low-frequency components, which decide the structure of images, exhibit higher similarity but poor continuity. In contrast, the high-frequency bands, which decode the details of images, show significant continuity but poor similarity. These interesting observations motivate us to propose Frequency-aware Caching (FreqCa)
  which directly reuses features of low-frequency components based on their similarity, while using a second-order Hermite interpolator to predict the volatile high-frequency ones based on its continuity.
  Besides, we further propose to cache Cumulative Residual Feature (CRF) instead of the features in all the layers, which reduces the memory footprint of feature caching by 99%.
  Extensive experiments on FLUX.1-dev, FLUX.1-Kontext-dev, Qwen-Image, and Qwen-Image-Edit demonstrate its effectiveness in both generation and editing. Codes are available in the supplementary materials and will be released on GitHub.

<title>BigCodeArena: Unveiling More Reliable Human Preferences in Code Generation via Execution</title>

Abstract: Crowdsourced model evaluation platforms, such as Chatbot Arena, enable real-time evaluation from human perspectives to assess the quality of model responses. In the coding domain, manually examining the quality of LLM-generated content is extremely challenging, as it requires understanding long chunks of raw code and deliberately simulating code execution. To this end, we introduce BigCodeArena, an open human evaluation platform for code generation backed by a comprehensive and on-the-fly execution environment. Built on top of Chatbot Arena, BigCodeArena enables the execution of LLM-generated code and allows humans to interact with the execution process and outcomes. We collected over 14,000 raw code-centric conversation sessions across 10 widely used LLMs, spanning 10 languages and 8 types of execution environments. Among these conversations, we identified more than 4,700 multi-turn samples with pairwise human preferences. Further analysis uncovers underexplored preferences of LLMs in fine-grained domains characterized by tasks, languages, and frameworks. To systematically examine code understanding and generation capabilities of frontier LLMs, we curated two benchmarks based on the collected data, namely BigCodeReward and AutoCodeArena. For BigCodeReward, we post-processed the 4,700 conversations and evaluated the consistency between reward models and human preferences. The evaluation shows that most LLMs have superior performance in judging coding preferences when the execution results are available. Inspired by these findings, we propose AutoCodeArena, an automatic Elo rating benchmark designed to assess the coding quality of LLMs without human involvement. We find that proprietary LLMs like GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Claude-Opus-4 still lead in code generation performance among recent emerging models.

<title>ConPoSe: LLM-Guided Contact Point Selection for Scalable Cooperative Object Pushing</title>

Abstract: Object transportation in cluttered environments is a fundamental task in various domains, including domestic service and warehouse logistics. In cooperative object transport, multiple robots must coordinate to move objects that are too large for a single robot. One transport strategy is pushing, which only requires simple robots. However, careful selection of robot-object contact points is necessary to push the object along a preplanned path. Although this selection can be solved analytically, the solution space grows combinatorially with the number of robots and object size, limiting scalability. Inspired by how humans rely on common-sense reasoning for cooperative transport, we propose combining the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models with local search to select suitable contact points. Our LLM-guided local search method for contact point selection, ConPoSe, successfully selects contact points for a variety of shapes, including cuboids, cylinders, and T-shapes. We demonstrate that ConPoSe scales better with the number of robots and object size than the analytical approach, and also outperforms pure LLM-based selection.

<title>In-Context Learning for Non-Stationary MIMO Equalization</title>

Abstract: Channel equalization is fundamental for mitigating distortions such as frequency-selective fading and inter-symbol interference. Unlike standard supervised learning approaches that require costly retraining or fine-tuning for each new task, in-context learning (ICL) adapts to new channels at inference time with only a few examples. However, existing ICL-based equalizers are primarily developed for and evaluated on static channels within the context window. Indeed, to our knowledge, prior principled analyses and theoretical studies of ICL focus exclusively on the stationary setting, where the function remains fixed within the context. In this paper, we investigate the ability of ICL to address non-stationary problems through the lens of time-varying channel equalization. We employ a principled framework for designing efficient attention mechanisms with improved adaptivity in non-stationary tasks, leveraging algorithms from adaptive signal processing to guide better designs. For example, new attention variants can be derived from the Least Mean Square (LMS) adaptive algorithm, a Least Root Mean Square (LRMS) formulation for enhanced robustness, or multi-step gradient updates for improved long-term tracking. Experimental results demonstrate that ICL holds strong promise for non-stationary MIMO equalization, and that attention mechanisms inspired by classical adaptive algorithms can substantially enhance adaptability and performance in dynamic environments. Our findings may provide critical insights for developing next-generation wireless foundation models with stronger adaptability and robustness.

Abstract: Instance discrimination is a self-supervised representation learning paradigm wherein individual instances within a dataset are treated as distinct classes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate substantial accuracy gains when augmented with reasoning modes such as chain-of-thought and inference-time scaling. However, reasoning also incurs significant costs in inference latency and token usage, with environmental and financial impacts, which are unnecessary for many simple prompts. We present a semantic router that classifies queries based on their reasoning requirements and selectively applies reasoning only when beneficial. Our approach achieves a 10.2 percentage point improvement in accuracy on the MMLU-Pro benchmark while reducing response latency by 47.1% and token consumption by 48.5% compared to direct inference with vLLM. These results demonstrate that semantic routing offers an effective mechanism for striking a balance between accuracy and efficiency in open-source LLM serving systems

Abstract: Geocoding is the task of linking a location reference to an actual geographic location and is essential for many downstream analyses of unstructured text. In this paper, we explore the challenging setting of geocoding compositional location references. Building on recent work demonstrating LLMs' abilities to reason over geospatial data, we evaluate LLMs' geospatial knowledge versus reasoning skills relevant to our task. Based on these insights, we propose an LLM-based strategy for geocoding compositional location references. We show that our approach improves performance for the task and that a relatively small fine-tuned LLM can achieve comparable performance with much larger off-the-shelf models.

Abstract: In-context learning allows large models to adapt to new tasks from a few demonstrations, but it has shown limited success in molecular design. Existing databases such as ChEMBL contain molecular properties spanning millions of biological assays, yet labeled data for each property remain scarce. To address this limitation, we introduce demonstration-conditioned diffusion models (DemoDiff), which define task contexts using a small set of molecule-score examples instead of text descriptions. These demonstrations guide a denoising Transformer to generate molecules aligned with target properties. For scalable pretraining, we develop a new molecular tokenizer with Node Pair Encoding that represents molecules at the motif level, requiring 5.5$\times$ fewer nodes. We curate a dataset containing millions of context tasks from multiple sources covering both drugs and materials, and pretrain a 0.7-billion-parameter model on it. Across 33 design tasks in six categories, DemoDiff matches or surpasses language models 100-1000$\times$ larger and achieves an average rank of 3.63 compared to 5.25-10.20 for domain-specific approaches. These results position DemoDiff as a molecular foundation model for in-context molecular design. Our code is available at https://github.com/liugangcode/DemoDiff.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks significantly challenge the safe deployment of deep learning models, particularly in real-world applications. Traditional defenses often rely on computationally intensive optimization (e.g., adversarial training or data augmentation) to improve robustness, whereas the human visual system achieves inherent robustness to adversarial perturbations through evolved biological mechanisms. We hypothesize that attention guided non-homogeneous sparse sampling and predictive coding plays a key role in this robustness. To test this hypothesis, we propose a novel defense framework incorporating three key biological mechanisms: foveal-peripheral processing, saccadic eye movements, and cortical filling-in. Our approach employs reinforcement learning-guided saccades to selectively capture multiple foveal-peripheral glimpses, which are integrated into a reconstructed image before classification. This biologically inspired preprocessing effectively mitigates adversarial noise, preserves semantic integrity, and notably requires no retraining or fine-tuning of downstream classifiers, enabling seamless integration with existing systems. Experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our method improves system robustness across diverse classifiers and attack types, while significantly reducing training overhead compared to both biologically and non-biologically inspired defense techniques.

Abstract: Text embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational for numerous applications. However, these models typically operate on raw text, overlooking the rich structural information, such as hyperlinks or citations, that provides crucial context in many real-world datasets. This paper introduces and systematically evaluates a new paradigm for generating structure-aware text embeddings by integrating these structural relations directly into the LLM's internal encoding process, rather than relying on traditional post-hoc aggregation. We investigate two primary in-process methods: sequential concatenation and parallel caching. Through extensive zero-shot experiments across retrieval, clustering, classification, and recommendation tasks, we demonstrate that our structure-aware approaches consistently outperform both text-only and post-hoc baselines. Our analysis reveals critical trade-offs: sequential concatenation excels with noisy, moderate-length contexts, while parallel caching scales more effectively to long, high-signal contexts but is more susceptible to distractors. To address the challenge of noisy structural data, we also introduce and validate two effective techniques: Context Distillation and Semantic Balancing. This work provides the first comprehensive analysis of in-process structure-aware encoding, offering a blueprint for building more powerful and contextually aware embedding models.

Abstract: Accurate recognition and re-identification of individual animals is essential for successful wildlife population monitoring. Traditional methods, such as leg banding of birds, are time consuming and invasive. Recent progress in artificial intelligence, particularly computer vision, offers encouraging solutions for smart conservation and efficient automation. This study presents a unique pipeline for extracting high-quality key frames from videos of k\={a}k\={a} (Nestor meridionalis), a threatened forest-dwelling parrot in New Zealand. Key frame extraction is well-studied in person re-identification, however, its application to wildlife is limited. Using video recordings at a custom-built feeder, we extract key frames and evaluate the re-identification performance of our pipeline. Our unsupervised methodology combines object detection using YOLO and Grounding DINO, optical flow blur detection, image encoding with DINOv2, and clustering methods to identify representative key frames. The results indicate that our proposed key frame selection methods yield image collections which achieve high accuracy in k\={a}k\={a} re-identification, providing a foundation for future research using media collected in more diverse and challenging environments. Through the use of artificial intelligence and computer vision, our non-invasive and efficient approach provides a valuable alternative to traditional physical tagging methods for recognising k\={a}k\={a} individuals and therefore improving the monitoring of populations. This research contributes to developing fresh approaches in wildlife monitoring, with applications in ecology and conservation biology.

Abstract: With LLM usage becoming widespread across countries, languages, and humanity more broadly, the need to understand and guardrail their multilingual responses increases. Large-scale datasets for testing and benchmarking have been created to evaluate and facilitate LLM responses across multiple dimensions. In this study, we evaluate the responses of frontier and leading open-source models in five dimensions across low and high-resource languages to measure LLM accuracy and consistency across multilingual contexts. We evaluate the responses using a five-point grading rubric and a judge LLM. Our study shows that GPT-5 performed the best on average in each category, while other models displayed more inconsistency across language and category. Most notably, in the Consent & Autonomy and Harm Prevention & Safety categories, GPT scored the highest with averages of 3.56 and 4.73, while Gemini 2.5 Pro scored the lowest with averages of 1.39 and 1.98, respectively. These findings emphasize the need for further testing on how linguistic shifts impact LLM responses across various categories and improvement in these areas.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents often struggle in sparse-reward environments where traditional exploration strategies fail to discover effective action sequences. Large Language Models (LLMs) possess procedural knowledge and reasoning capabilities from text pretraining that could guide RL exploration, but existing approaches create rigid dependencies where RL policies must follow LLM suggestions or incorporate them directly into reward functions. We propose a framework that provides LLM-generated action recommendations through augmented observation spaces, allowing RL agents to learn when to follow or ignore this guidance. Our method leverages LLMs' world knowledge and reasoning abilities while maintaining flexibility through soft constraints. We evaluate our approach on three BabyAI environments of increasing complexity and show that the benefits of LLM guidance scale with task difficulty. In the most challenging environment, we achieve 71% relative improvement in final success rates over baseline. The approach provides substantial sample efficiency gains, with agents reaching performance thresholds up to 9 times faster, and requires no modifications to existing RL algorithms. Our results demonstrate an effective method for leveraging LLM planning capabilities to accelerate RL training in challenging environments.

Abstract: In an ideal design pipeline, user interface (UI) design is intertwined with user research to validate decisions, yet studies are often resource-constrained during early exploration. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer a promising opportunity to act as early evaluators, helping designers narrow options before formal testing. Unlike prior work that emphasizes user behavior in narrow domains such as e-commerce with metrics like clicks or conversions, we focus on subjective user evaluations across varied interfaces. We investigate whether MLLMs can mimic human preferences when evaluating individual UIs and comparing them. Using data from a crowdsourcing platform, we benchmark GPT-4o, Claude, and Llama across 30 interfaces and examine alignment with human judgments on multiple UI factors. Our results show that MLLMs approximate human preferences on some dimensions but diverge on others, underscoring both their potential and limitations in supplementing early UX research.

Abstract: We consider a multi-armed bandit setting in which each arm has a public and a private reward distribution. An observer expects an agent to follow Thompson Sampling according to the public rewards, however, the deceptive agent aims to quickly identify the best private arm without being noticed. The observer can observe the public rewards and the pulled arms, but not the private rewards. The agent, on the other hand, observes both the public and private rewards. We formalize detectability as a stepwise Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence constraint between the actual pull probabilities used by the agent and the anticipated pull probabilities by the observer. We model successful pulling of public suboptimal arms as a % Bernoulli process where the success probability decreases with each successful pull, and show these pulls can happen at most at a $\Theta(\sqrt{T}) $ rate under the KL constraint. We then formulate a maximin problem based on public and private means, whose solution characterizes the optimal error exponent for best private arm identification. We finally propose an algorithm inspired by top-two algorithms. This algorithm naturally adapts its exploration according to the hardness of pulling arms based on the public suboptimality gaps. We provide numerical examples illustrating the $\Theta(\sqrt{T}) $ rate and the behavior of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: Diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) is a key component in video generation and video restoration, but is slow and expensive, limiting scalability to higher resolutions and longer videos. Our key insight is that many regions in video are inherently low-detail and gain little from refinement, yet current methods process all pixels uniformly. To take advantage of this, we propose SkipSR, a simple framework for accelerating video SR by identifying low-detail regions directly from low-resolution input, then skipping computation on them entirely, only super-resolving the areas that require refinement. This simple yet effective strategy preserves perceptual quality in both standard and one-step diffusion SR models while significantly reducing computation. In standard SR benchmarks, our method achieves up to 60% faster end-to-end latency than prior models on 720p videos with no perceptible loss in quality. Video demos are available at https://rccchoudhury.github.io/skipsr/

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated advanced reasoning capabilities, their comprehensive evaluation in general Chinese-language contexts remains understudied. To bridge this gap, we propose Chinese Commonsense Multi-hop Reasoning (CCMOR), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to integrate Chinese-specific factual knowledge with multi-step logical reasoning. Specifically, we first construct a domain-balanced seed set from existing QA datasets, then develop an LLM-powered pipeline to generate multi-hop questions anchored on factual unit chains. To ensure the quality of resulting dataset, we implement a human-in-the-loop verification system, where domain experts systematically validate and refine the generated questions. Using CCMOR, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating persistent limitations in LLMs' ability to process long-tail knowledge and execute knowledge-intensive reasoning. Notably, retrieval-augmented generation substantially mitigates these knowledge gaps, yielding significant performance gains.

Abstract: Deep space missions face extreme communication delays and environmental uncertainty that prevent real-time ground operations. To support autonomous science operations in communication-constrained environments, we present a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) framework that adaptively sequences spacecraft science instruments. We integrate a Bayesian network into the POMDP observation space to manage the high-dimensional and uncertain measurements typical of astrobiology missions. This network compactly encodes dependencies among measurements and improves the interpretability and computational tractability of science data. Instrument operation policies are computed offline, allowing resource-aware plans to be generated and thoroughly validated prior to launch. We use the Enceladus Orbilander's proposed Life Detection Suite (LDS) as a case study, demonstrating how Bayesian network structure and reward shaping influence system performance. We compare our method against the mission's baseline Concept of Operations (ConOps), evaluating both misclassification rates and performance in off-nominal sample accumulation scenarios. Our approach reduces sample identification errors by nearly 40%

Abstract: We give a compositional, information-theoretic framework that turns short programs into locality on many independent blocks, and combine it with symmetry and sparsity of masked random Unique-SAT to obtain distributional lower bounds that contradict the self-reduction upper bound under $\mathsf{P}=\mathsf{NP}$. We work in the weakness quantale $w_Q=K_{\mathrm{poly}}(\cdot\mid\cdot)$. For an efficiently samplable ensemble $D_m$ made by masking random $3$-CNFs with fresh $S_m\ltimes(\mathbb{Z}_2)^m$ symmetries and a small-seed Valiant--Vazirani isolation layer, we prove a Switching-by-Weakness normal form: for any polytime decoder $P$ of description length $\le \delta t$ (with $t=\Theta(m)$ blocks), a short wrapper $W$ makes $(P\circ W)$ per-bit local on a $\gamma$-fraction of blocks. Two ingredients then force near-randomness on $\Omega(t)$ blocks for every short decoder: (a) a sign-invariant neutrality lemma giving $\Pr[X_i=1\mid \mathcal{I}]=1/2$ for any sign-invariant view $\mathcal{I}$; and (b) a template sparsification theorem at logarithmic radius showing that any fixed local rule appears with probability $m^{-\Omega(1)}$. Combined with single-block bounds for tiny $\mathrm{ACC}^0$/streaming decoders, this yields a success bound $2^{-\Omega(t)}$ and, by Compression-from-Success, $K_{\mathrm{poly}}\big((X_1,\ldots,X_t)\mid(\Phi_1,\ldots,\Phi_t)\big)\ge \eta t$. If $\mathsf{P}=\mathsf{NP}$, a uniform constant-length program maps any on-promise instance to its unique witness in polytime (bit fixing via a $\mathrm{USAT}$ decider), so $K_{\mathrm{poly}}(X\mid\Phi)\le O(1)$ and the tuple complexity is $O(1)$, contradicting the linear bound. The proof is non-relativizing and non-natural; symmetry, sparsification, and switching yield a quantale upper-lower clash, hence $\mathsf{P}\ne\mathsf{NP}$.

<title>D-CoDe: Scaling Image-Pretrained VLMs to Video via Dynamic Compression and Question Decomposition</title>

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs), which excel in diverse video-language tasks, can be effectively constructed by adapting image-pretrained vision-language models (VLMs). However, this adaptation remains challenging, as it requires processing dense and temporally extended visual inputs that exceed the capacity of image-based models. This paper identifies the perception bottleneck and token overload as key challenges in extending image-based VLMs to the video domain. To address these issues, we propose D-CoDe, a training-free adaptation framework that incorporates dynamic compression and question decomposition. Specifically, dynamic compression alleviates the perception bottleneck through adaptive selection of representative frames and content-aware aggregation of spatial tokens, thereby reducing redundancy while preserving informative content. In parallel, question decomposition mitigates token overload by reformulating the original query into sub-questions, guiding the model to focus on distinct aspects of the video and enabling more comprehensive understanding. Experiments demonstrate that D-CoDe effectively improves video understanding across various benchmarks. Furthermore, strong performance on the challenging long-video benchmark highlights the potential of D-CoDe in handling complex video-language tasks.

Abstract: When learning to code, students often develop misconceptions about various programming language concepts. These can not only lead to bugs or inefficient code, but also slow down the learning of related concepts. In this paper, we introduce McMining, the task of mining programming misconceptions from samples of code from a student. To enable the training and evaluation of McMining systems, we develop an extensible benchmark dataset of misconceptions together with a large set of code samples where these misconceptions are manifested. We then introduce two LLM-based McMiner approaches and through extensive evaluations show that models from the Gemini, Claude, and GPT families are effective at discovering misconceptions in student code.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of LLM agents with access to numerous tools and sensitive data significantly widens the attack surface for indirect prompt injections. Due to the context-dependent nature of attacks, however, current defenses are often ill-calibrated as they cannot reliably differentiate malicious and benign instructions, leading to high false positive rates that prevent their real-world adoption. To address this, we present a novel approach inspired by the fundamental principle of computer security: data should not contain executable instructions. Instead of sample-level classification, we propose a token-level sanitization process, which surgically removes any instructions directed at AI systems from tool outputs, capturing malicious instructions as a byproduct. In contrast to existing safety classifiers, this approach is non-blocking, does not require calibration, and is agnostic to the context of tool outputs. Further, we can train such token-level predictors with readily available instruction-tuning data only, and don't have to rely on unrealistic prompt injection examples from challenges or of other synthetic origin. In our experiments, we find that this approach generalizes well across a wide range of attacks and benchmarks like AgentDojo, BIPIA, InjecAgent, ASB and SEP, achieving a 7-10x reduction of attack success rate (ASR) (34% to 3% on AgentDojo), without impairing agent utility in both benign and malicious settings.

<title>Reinforcement Learning-Driven Edge Management for Reliable Multi-view 3D Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: Real-time multi-view 3D reconstruction is a mission-critical application for key edge-native use cases, such as fire rescue, where timely and accurate 3D scene modeling enables situational awareness and informed decision-making. However, the dynamic and unpredictable nature of edge resource availability introduces disruptions, such as degraded image quality, unstable network links, and fluctuating server loads, which challenge the reliability of the reconstruction pipeline. In this work, we present a reinforcement learning (RL)-based edge resource management framework for reliable 3D reconstruction to ensure high quality reconstruction within a reasonable amount of time, despite the system operating under a resource-constrained and disruption-prone environment. In particular, the framework adopts two cooperative Q-learning agents, one for camera selection and one for server selection, both of which operate entirely online, learning policies through interactions with the edge environment. To support learning under realistic constraints and evaluate system performance, we implement a distributed testbed comprising lab-hosted end devices and FABRIC infrastructure-hosted edge servers to emulate smart city edge infrastructure under realistic disruption scenarios. Results show that the proposed framework improves application reliability by effectively balancing end-to-end latency and reconstruction quality in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Modern codebases make it hard for developers and AI coding assistants to find the right source files when answering questions like "How does this feature work?" or "Where was the bug introduced?" Traditional code search (keyword or IR based) often misses semantic context and cross file links, while large language models (LLMs) understand natural language but lack repository specific detail. We present a method for file path retrieval that fine tunes a strong LLM (Qwen3-8B) with QLoRA and Unsloth optimizations to predict relevant file paths directly from a natural language query. To build training data, we introduce six code aware strategies that use abstract syntax tree (AST) structure and repository content to generate realistic question-answer pairs, where answers are sets of file paths. The strategies range from single file prompts to hierarchical repository summaries, providing broad coverage. We fine tune on Python projects including Flask, Click, Jinja, FastAPI, and PyTorch, and obtain high retrieval accuracy: up to 91\% exact match and 93\% recall on held out queries, clearly beating single strategy training. On a large codebase like PyTorch (about 4,000 Python files), the model reaches 59\% recall, showing scalability. We analyze how multi level code signals help the LLM reason over cross file context and discuss dataset design, limits (for example, context length in very large repos), and future integration of retrieval with LLM based code intelligence.

<title>Time-Aware Feature Selection: Adaptive Temporal Masking for Stable Sparse Autoencoder Training</title>

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models is crucial for ensuring their reliability and safety, with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) emerging as a promising interpretability approach. However, current SAE training methods face feature absorption, where features (or neurons) are absorbed into each other to minimize $L_1$ penalty, making it difficult to consistently identify and analyze model behaviors. We introduce Adaptive Temporal Masking (ATM), a novel training approach that dynamically adjusts feature selection by tracking activation magnitudes, frequencies, and reconstruction contributions to compute importance scores that evolve over time. ATM applies a probabilistic masking mechanism based on statistical thresholding of these importance scores, creating a more natural feature selection process. Through extensive experiments on the Gemma-2-2b model, we demonstrate that ATM achieves substantially lower absorption scores compared to existing methods like TopK and JumpReLU SAEs, while maintaining excellent reconstruction quality. These results establish ATM as a principled solution for learning stable, interpretable features in neural networks, providing a foundation for more reliable model analysis.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to multi-turn jailbreaking attacks that exploit conversational context to bypass safety constraints gradually. These attacks target different harm categories (like malware generation, harassment, or fraud) through distinct conversational approaches (educational discussions, personal experiences, hypothetical scenarios). Existing multi-turn jailbreaking methods often rely on heuristic or ad hoc exploration strategies, providing limited insight into underlying model weaknesses. The relationship between conversation patterns and model vulnerabilities across harm categories remains poorly understood. We propose Pattern Enhanced Chain of Attack (PE-CoA), a framework of five conversation patterns to construct effective multi-turn jailbreaks through natural dialogue. Evaluating PE-CoA on twelve LLMs spanning ten harm categories, we achieve state-of-the-art performance, uncovering pattern-specific vulnerabilities and LLM behavioral characteristics: models exhibit distinct weakness profiles where robustness to one conversational pattern does not generalize to others, and model families share similar failure modes. These findings highlight limitations of safety training and indicate the need for pattern-aware defenses. Code available on: https://github.com/Ragib-Amin-Nihal/PE-CoA

Abstract: Many important applications across science, data analytics, and AI workloads depend on distributed matrix multiplication. Prior work has developed a large array of algorithms suitable for different problem sizes and partitionings including 1D, 2D, 1.5D, and 2.5D algorithms. A limitation of current work is that existing algorithms are limited to a subset of partitionings. Multiple algorithm implementations are required to support the full space of possible partitionings. If no algorithm implementation is available for a particular set of partitionings, one or more operands must be redistributed, increasing communication costs. This paper presents a universal one-sided algorithm for distributed matrix multiplication that supports all combinations of partitionings and replication factors. Our algorithm uses slicing (index arithmetic) to compute the sets of overlapping tiles that must be multiplied together. This list of local matrix multiplies can then either be executed directly, or reordered and lowered to an optimized IR to maximize overlap. We implement our algorithm using a high-level C++-based PGAS programming framework that performs direct GPU-to-GPU communication using intra-node interconnects. We evaluate performance for a wide variety of partitionings and replication factors, finding that our work is competitive with PyTorch DTensor, a highly optimized distributed tensor library targeting AI models.

The graph encodes syntactic relations such as containment, implementation, references, calls, and inheritance, and augments nodes with LLM-derived summaries and vector embeddings. A hybrid retrieval pipeline combines semantic retrieval with graph-aware expansion, and an LLM-based assistant formulates constrained, read-only graph requests and produces human-oriented explanations.

Abstract: Text-to-audio (TTA) generation with fine-grained control signals, e.g., precise timing control or intelligible speech content, has been explored in recent works. However, constrained by data scarcity, their generation performance at scale is still compromised. In this study, we recast controllable TTA generation as a multi-task learning problem and introduce a progressive diffusion modeling approach, ControlAudio. Our method adeptly fits distributions conditioned on more fine-grained information, including text, timing, and phoneme features, through a step-by-step strategy. First, we propose a data construction method spanning both annotation and simulation, augmenting condition information in the sequence of text, timing, and phoneme. Second, at the model training stage, we pretrain a diffusion transformer (DiT) on large-scale text-audio pairs, achieving scalable TTA generation, and then incrementally integrate the timing and phoneme features with unified semantic representations, expanding controllability. Finally, at the inference stage, we propose progressively guided generation, which sequentially emphasizes more fine-grained information, aligning inherently with the coarse-to-fine sampling nature of DiT. Extensive experiments show that ControlAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of temporal accuracy and speech clarity, significantly outperforming existing methods on both objective and subjective evaluations.

Abstract: Interprofessional education has long relied on case studies and the use of standardized patients to support teamwork, communication, and related collaborative competencies among healthcare professionals. However, traditional approaches are often limited by cost, scalability, and inability to mimic the dynamic complexity of real-world clinical scenarios. To address these challenges, we designed and developed AIMS (AI-Enhanced Immersive Multidisciplinary Simulations), a virtual simulation that integrates a large language model (Gemini-2.5-Flash), a Unity-based virtual environment engine, and a character creation pipeline to support synchronized, multimodal interactions between the user and the virtual patient. AIMS was designed to enhance collaborative clinical reasoning and health promotion competencies among students from pharmacy, medicine, nursing, and social work. A formal usability testing session was conducted which participants assumed professional roles on a healthcare team and engaged in a mix of scripted and unscripted conversations. Participants explored the patient's symptoms, social context, and care needs. Usability issues were identified (e.g., audio routing, response latency) and used to guide subsequent refinements. Findings in general suggest that AIMS supports realistic, profession-specific and contextually appropriate conversations. We discussed both technical and pedagogical innovations of AIMS and concluded with future directions.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has demonstrated substantial improvements in the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), exhibiting significant applicability across various domains. Recent research has identified that tokens within LLMs play distinct roles during reasoning tasks, categorizing them into high-entropy reasoning tokens and low-entropy knowledge tokens. Prior approaches have typically focused on restricting updates to indirectly encourage exploration, yet they do not explicitly facilitate exploratory behavior during the token generation stage itself. In this work, we introduce a complementary approach that explicitly promotes exploration during sampling by applying distinct temperature settings for different token types. Specifically, our method employs higher temperatures for reasoning tokens to actively encourage exploration, while retaining lower temperatures for knowledge tokens to maintain factual correctness. Furthermore, we systematically investigate various multi-temperature scheduling strategies and their impacts within reinforcement learning contexts. Empirical evaluations on several reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the reasoning performance of LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/zhmzm/Multi_Temperature_Verl.git.

Abstract: We present HES-SQL, a novel hybrid training framework that advances Text-to-SQL generation through the integration of thinking-mode-fused supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a skeleton-completeness scoring mechanism that enhances preference alignment between generated queries and optimal SQL structures; (2) a query-latency-aware reward system that incentivizes the generation of computationally efficient SQL queries; (3) a self-distillation process for thinking-mode completion that prevents degradation of the model's reasoning capabilities. This framework enables hybrid thinking models to switch between reasoning and non-reasoning modes while improving SQL query accuracy and execution efficiency.
  Experimental evaluation, conducted on MySQL 8.0 and SQLite 3.42 under controlled single-user conditions, demonstrates that HES-SQL achieves competitive performance with execution accuracies of 79.14\% and 54.9\% on the BIRD and KaggleDBQA benchmarks, respectively. Query latency is measured as the end-to-end execution time of generated queries on the DBMS, averaged over multiple runs to mitigate variance. Efficiency gains range from 11\% to 20\% relative to supervised baselines. Our results establish a new paradigm for Text-to-SQL systems that effectively balances semantic accuracy with computational efficiency through execution-informed reinforcement learning (RL). The proposed methodology has significant implications for developing robust natural language interfaces to databases and can be extended to broader structured generation tasks requiring both correctness and efficiency optimization.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) enhances complex reasoning in LLMs, current methods struggle to balance exploration and exploitation. This leads to critical issues like inaccurate credit assignment for intermediate steps and premature entropy collapse, limiting model performance. To address this, we introduce Attribution-based Contribution to Policy Optimization (ACPO), a phased framework that incorporates a difficulty-aware curriculum. ACPO improves exploration by using trajectory semantic segmentation and an attribution-based representation to dynamically regulate policy entropy, thus mitigating its collapse. Concurrently, it enhances exploitation with a factorized reward system that precisely quantifies the hierarchical contribution of each reasoning step, ensuring accurate credit assignment. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, including AIME, MATH, and AMC, demonstrate that ACPO significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Accurate recognition of biomedical named entities is critical for medical information extraction and knowledge discovery. However, existing methods often struggle with nested entities, entity boundary ambiguity, and cross-lingual generalization. In this paper, we propose a unified Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (BioNER) framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs). We first reformulate BioNER as a text generation task and design a symbolic tagging strategy to jointly handle both flat and nested entities with explicit boundary annotation. To enhance multilingual and multi-task generalization, we perform bilingual joint fine-tuning across multiple Chinese and English datasets. Additionally, we introduce a contrastive learning-based entity selector that filters incorrect or spurious predictions by leveraging boundary-sensitive positive and negative samples. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets and two unseen corpora show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and robust zero-shot generalization across languages.

Abstract: The stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is one of the most fundamental models in sequential decision-making, with the core challenge being the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Although algorithms such as Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, along with their regret theories, are well-established, existing analyses primarily operate from a time-domain and cumulative regret perspective, struggling to characterize the dynamic nature of the learning process. This paper proposes a novel frequency-domain analysis framework, reformulating the bandit process as a signal processing problem. Within this framework, the reward estimate of each arm is viewed as a spectral component, with its uncertainty corresponding to the component's frequency, and the bandit algorithm is interpreted as an adaptive filter. We construct a formal Frequency-Domain Bandit Model and prove the main theorem: the confidence bound term in the UCB algorithm is equivalent in the frequency domain to a time-varying gain applied to uncertain spectral components, a gain inversely proportional to the square root of the visit count. Based on this, we further derive finite-time dynamic bounds concerning the exploration rate decay. This theory not only provides a novel and intuitive physical interpretation for classical algorithms but also lays a rigorous theoretical foundation for designing next-generation algorithms with adaptive parameter adjustment.

Building on this foundation, we introduce a human-AI collaborative profile for a movie recommender system that presents editable personalized interest summaries of a user's movie history. Unlike static profiles, this design invites users to directly inspect, modify, and reflect on the system's inferences. In an eight-week online field deployment with 1775 active movie recommender users, we find persistent gaps between user-perceived and system-inferred interests, show how the profile encourages engagement and reflection, and identify design directions for leveraging imperfect AI-powered user profiles to stimulate more user intervention and build more transparent and trustworthy recommender experiences.

Abstract: Recently, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant performance across various video understanding tasks. However, their robustness, particularly when faced with manipulated video content, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Ro-Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on dynamic out-of-distribution (OOD) counterfactual video test sets. Ro-Bench incorporates high-quality, diverse and temporally relevant video data, by editing Style, Object, Background and their compositions. We evaluated eight recent video MLLMs and found that current models exhibit substantial performance degradation on Ro-Bench when exposed to counterfactual video content. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning MLLMs with counterfactual data enhances robustness, achieving a 21.73% performance increase on Ro-Bench and a 12.78% improvement across 20 tasks in the MVBench dataset. These findings underscore the effectiveness of counterfactual data in enhancing the video understanding ability of MLLMs. The code and data will be released shortly.

<title>SHERLOCK: Towards Dynamic Knowledge Adaptation in LLM-enhanced E-commerce Risk Management</title>

Abstract: The growth of the e-commerce industry has intensified the adversarial dynamics between shadow economy actors and risk management teams. Companies often conduct risk investigations into suspicious cases to identify emerging fraud patterns, thereby enhancing both preemptive risk prevention and post-hoc governance. However, the sheer volume of case analyses imposes a substantial workload on risk management analysts, as each case requires the integration of long-term expert experience and meticulous scrutiny across multiple risk dimensions. Additionally, individual disparities among analysts hinder the establishment of uniform and high-standard workflows. To address these challenges, we propose the SHERLOCK framework, which leverages the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to assist analysts in risk investigations. Our approach consists of three primary components: (1) extracting risk management knowledge from multi-modal data and constructing a domain knowledge base (KB), (2) building an intelligent platform guided by the data flywheel paradigm that integrates daily operations, expert annotations, and model evaluations, with iteratively fine-tuning for preference alignment, and (3) introducing a Reflect & Refine (R&amp;R) module that collaborates with the domain KB to establish a rapid response mechanism for evolving risk patterns. Experiments conducted on the real-world transaction dataset from JD.com demonstrate that our method significantly improves the precision of both factual alignment and risk localization within the LLM analysis results. Deployment of the SHERLOCK-based LLM system on JD.com has substantially enhanced the efficiency of case investigation workflows for risk managers.

Abstract: We study how open source communities describe participation and control through version controlled governance documents. Using a corpus of 710 projects with paired snapshots, we parse text into actors, rules, actions, and objects, then group them and measure change with entropy for evenness, richness for diversity, and Jensen Shannon divergence for drift. Projects define more roles and more actions over time, and these are distributed more evenly, while the composition of rules remains stable. These findings indicate that governance grows by expanding and balancing categories of participation without major shifts in prescriptive force. The analysis provides a reproducible baseline for evaluating whether future AI mediated workflows concentrate or redistribute authority.

Abstract: Learning with high-resource data has demonstrated substantial success in artificial intelligence (AI); however, the costs associated with data annotation and model training remain significant. A fundamental objective of AI research is to achieve robust generalization with limited-resource data. This survey employs agnostic active sampling theory within the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) framework to analyze the generalization error and label complexity associated with learning from low-resource data in both model-agnostic supervised and unsupervised settings. Based on this analysis, we investigate a suite of optimization strategies tailored for low-resource data learning, including gradient-informed optimization, meta-iteration optimization, geometry-aware optimization, and LLMs-powered optimization. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive overview of multiple learning paradigms that can benefit from low-resource data, including domain transfer, reinforcement feedback, and hierarchical structure modeling. Finally, we conclude our analysis and investigation by summarizing the key findings and highlighting their implications for learning with low-resource data.

<title>Learning Regularizers: Learning Optimizers that can Regularize</title>

Abstract: Learned Optimizers (LOs), a type of Meta-learning, have gained traction due to their ability to be parameterized and trained for efficient optimization. Traditional gradient-based methods incorporate explicit regularization techniques such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), Gradient-norm Aware Minimization (GAM), and Gap-guided Sharpness-Aware Minimization (GSAM) to enhance generalization and convergence. In this work, we explore a fundamental question: \textbf{Can regularizers be learned?} We empirically demonstrate that LOs can be trained to learn and internalize the effects of traditional regularization techniques without explicitly applying them to the objective function. We validate this through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks (including MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR and Neural Networks such as MLP, MLP-Relu and CNN), comparing LOs trained with and without access to explicit regularizers. Regularized LOs consistently outperform their unregularized counterparts in terms of test accuracy and generalization. Furthermore, we show that LOs retain and transfer these regularization effects to new optimization tasks by inherently seeking minima similar to those targeted by these regularizers. Our results suggest that LOs can inherently learn regularization properties, \textit{challenging the conventional necessity of explicit optimizee loss regularization.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of software development has significant environmental, technical, social, and economic impacts. Achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 compels developers to adopt sustainable practices. Existing methods mostly offer high-level guidelines, which are time-consuming to implement and rely on team adaptability. Moreover, they focus on design or implementation, while sustainability assessment should start at the requirements engineering phase. In this paper, we introduce SEER, a framework which addresses sustainability concerns in the early software development phase. The framework operates in three stages: (i) it identifies sustainability requirements (SRs) relevant to a specific software product from a general taxonomy; (ii) it evaluates how sustainable system requirements are based on the identified SRs; and (iii) it optimizes system requirements that fail to satisfy any SR. The framework is implemented using the reasoning capabilities of large language models and the agentic RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) approach. SEER has been experimented on four software projects from different domains. Results generated using Gemini 2.5 reasoning model demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in accurately identifying a broad range of sustainability concerns across diverse domains.

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) has emerged as a powerful tool for designing efficient deep neural networks (DNNs) tailored to edge devices. However, existing methods remain largely impractical for real-world deployment due to their high time cost, extensive manual profiling, and poor scalability across diverse hardware platforms with complex, device-specific energy behavior. In this paper, we present PlatformX, a fully automated and transferable HW-NAS framework designed to overcome these limitations. PlatformX integrates four key components: (i) an energy-driven search space that expands conventional NAS design by incorporating energy-critical configurations, enabling exploration of high-efficiency architectures; (ii) a transferable kernel-level energy predictor across devices and incrementally refined with minimal on-device samples; (iii) a Pareto-based multi-objective search algorithm that balances energy and accuracy to identify optimal trade-offs; and (iv) a high-resolution runtime energy profiling system that automates on-device power measurement using external monitors without human intervention. We evaluate PlatformX across multiple mobile platforms, showing that it significantly reduces search overhead while preserving accuracy and energy fidelity. It identifies models with up to 0.94 accuracy or as little as 0.16 mJ per inference, both outperforming MobileNet-V2 in accuracy and efficiency. Code and tutorials are available at github.com/amai-gsu/PlatformX.

Abstract: Current benchmarks for evaluating software engineering agents, such as SWE-Bench Verified, are predominantly derived from GitHub issues and fail to accurately reflect how developers interact with chat-based coding assistants in integrated development environments (IDEs). We posit that this mismatch leads to a systematic overestimation of agent's capabilities in real-world scenarios, especially bug fixing. We introduce a novel benchmarking framework that transforms existing formal benchmarks into realistic user queries through systematic analysis of developer interaction patterns with chat-based agents. Our methodology is flexible and can be easily extended to existing benchmarks. In this paper, we apply our testing framework to SWE-Bench Verified, the TypeScript subset of Multi-SWE-Bench and a private benchmark, SWE-Bench C# and transform formal GitHub issue descriptions into realistic user-style queries based on telemetry analysis of a popular chat-based agent interactions. Our findings reveal that existing benchmarks significantly overestimate agent capabilities for some models by >50% over baseline performance for public benchmarks and ~10-16% for our internal benchmark. This work establishes a new paradigm for evaluating interactive chat-based software engineering agents through benchmark mutation techniques.

Abstract: Compressing large-scale neural networks is essential for deploying models on resource-constrained devices. Most existing methods adopt weight pruning or low-bit quantization individually, often resulting in suboptimal compression rates to preserve acceptable performance drops. We introduce a unified framework for simultaneous pruning and low-bit quantization via Bayesian variational learning (SQS), which achieves higher compression rates than prior baselines while maintaining comparable performance. The key idea is to employ a spike-and-slab prior to inducing sparsity and model quantized weights using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to enable low-bit precision. In theory, we provide the consistent result of our proposed variational approach to a sparse and quantized deep neural network. Extensive experiments on compressing ResNet, BERT-base, Llama3, and Qwen2.5 models show that our method achieves higher compression rates than a line of existing methods with comparable performance drops.

<title>On Epistemic Uncertainty of Visual Tokens for Object Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs), which integrate a vision encoder (VE) with a large language model, have achieved remarkable success across various tasks. However, there are still crucial challenges in LVLMs such as object hallucination, generating descriptions of objects that are not in the input image. Here, we argue that uncertain visual tokens within the VE is a key factor that contributes to object hallucination. Our statistical analysis found that there are positive correlations between visual tokens with high epistemic uncertainty and the occurrence of hallucinations. Furthermore, we show theoretically and empirically that visual tokens in early VE layers that exhibit large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations indicate high epistemic uncertainty. Based on these findings, we propose a simple yet effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the VE only. Our method comprises a proxy method with adversarial perturbations for identifying uncertain visual tokens efficiently and a method to mask these uncertain visual tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers of the VE, suppressing their influence on visual encoding and thus alleviating hallucinations. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can synergistically work with other prior arts.

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion-based Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) demonstrates strong expressiveness but remains limited by data scarcity and model scalability. We introduce a two-stage pipeline: a compact seed set of human-sung recordings is constructed by pairing fixed melodies with diverse LLM-generated lyrics, and melody-specific models are trained to synthesize over 500 hours of high-quality Chinese singing data. Building on this corpus, we propose DiTSinger, a Diffusion Transformer with RoPE and qk-norm, systematically scaled in depth, width, and resolution for enhanced fidelity. Furthermore, we design an implicit alignment mechanism that obviates phoneme-level duration labels by constraining phoneme-to-acoustic attention within character-level spans, thereby improving robustness under noisy or uncertain alignments. Extensive experiments validate that our approach enables scalable, alignment-free, and high-fidelity SVS.

<title>Value-State Gated Attention for Mitigating Extreme-Token Phenomena in Transformers</title>

Abstract: Large models based on the Transformer architecture are susceptible to extreme-token phenomena, such as attention sinks and value-state drains. These issues, which degrade model performance, quantization fidelity, and interpretability, arise from a problematic mutual reinforcement mechanism where the model learns an inefficient 'no-op' behavior by focusing attention on tokens with near-zero value states. In this paper, we propose Value-State Gated Attention (VGA), a simple, dedicated, and stable architectural mechanism for performing 'no-op' attention efficiently by directly breaking this cycle. VGA introduces a learnable, data-dependent gate, computed directly from the value vectors (V), to modulate the output. Through a theoretical analysis of the underlying gradients, we show that gating the value-state with a function of itself is more effective at decoupling value and attention score updates than prior methods that gate on input embeddings. This creates a direct regulatory pathway that allows the model to suppress a token's contribution based on its emergent value representation. Our experiments demonstrate that VGA significantly mitigates the formation of attention sinks and stabilizes value-state norms, leading to improved performance, robust quantization fidelity, and enhanced model interpretability.

Most existing algorithms rely on paired dry/reverberant data, which is difficult to obtain. Our approach uses limited acoustic information, like the reverberation time (RT60), to train a dereverberation system. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves more consistent performance across various objective metrics than the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated remarkable success in developing autonomous driving policies. However, its vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains a critical barrier to real-world deployment. Although existing robust methods have achieved success, they still suffer from three key issues: (i) these methods are trained against myopic adversarial attacks, limiting their abilities to respond to more strategic threats, (ii) they have trouble causing truly safety-critical events (e.g., collisions), but instead often result in minor consequences, and (iii) these methods can introduce learning instability and policy drift during training due to the lack of robust constraints. To address these issues, we propose Intelligent General-sum Constrained Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (IGCARL), a novel robust autonomous driving approach that consists of a strategic targeted adversary and a robust driving agent. The strategic targeted adversary is designed to leverage the temporal decision-making capabilities of DRL to execute strategically coordinated multi-step attacks. In addition, it explicitly focuses on inducing safety-critical events by adopting a general-sum objective. The robust driving agent learns by interacting with the adversary to develop a robust autonomous driving policy against adversarial attacks. To ensure stable learning in adversarial environments and to mitigate policy drift caused by attacks, the agent is optimized under a constrained formulation. Extensive experiments show that IGCARL improves the success rate by at least 27.9\% over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior robustness to adversarial attacks and enhancing the safety and reliability of DRL-based autonomous driving.

Abstract: In the domain of software development, LLMs have been utilized to automate tasks such as code translation, where source code from one programming language is translated to another while preserving its functionality. However, LLMs often struggle with long source codes that don't fit into the context window, which produces inaccurate translations. To address this, we propose a novel zero-shot code translation method that incorporates identifier replacement. By substituting user-given long identifiers with generalized placeholders during translation, our method allows the LLM to focus on the logical structure of the code, by reducing token count and memory usage, which improves the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of long code translation. Our empirical results demonstrate that our approach preserves syntactical and hierarchical information and produces translation results with reduced tokens.

Abstract: Developing a high-performing large language models (LLMs) for low-resource languages such as Urdu, present several challenges. These challenges include the scarcity of high-quality datasets, multilingual inconsistencies, and safety concerns. Existing multilingual LLMs often address these issues by translating large volumes of available data. However, such translations often lack quality and cultural nuance while also incurring significant costs for data curation and training. To address these issues, we propose Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, a multilingual Urdu-English model, that tackles these challenges with a unique approach. We train the model on a high-quality, multilingual synthetic dataset (Urdu-Instruct), developed using a modified self-instruct technique. By using unique prompts and seed values for each task along with a global task pool, this dataset incorporates Urdu-native chain-of-thought based reasoning, bilingual translation, cultural relevance, and ethical safety alignments. This technique significantly enhances the comprehension of Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct model for Urdu-specific tasks. As a result, Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, built upon the pretrained Llama-3.1-8B, demonstrates superior performance compared to Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct for Urdu specific-tasks. It also outperformed leading multilingual LLMs, including Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct, and Cohere-Aya-Expanse-8B, all within a training budget of under $100. Our results demonstrate that high-performance and low-resource language LLMs can be developed efficiently and culturally aligned using our modified self-instruct approach. All datasets, models, and code are publicly available at: https://github.com/traversaal-ai/alif-urdu-llm.

Abstract: Effectiveness of speech emotion recognition in real-world scenarios is often hindered by noisy environments and variability across datasets. This paper introduces a two-step approach to enhance the robustness and generalization of speech emotion recognition models through improved representation learning. First, our model employs EDRL (Emotion-Disentangled Representation Learning) to extract class-specific discriminative features while preserving shared similarities across emotion categories. Next, MEA (Multiblock Embedding Alignment) refines these representations by projecting them into a joint discriminative latent subspace that maximizes covariance with the original speech input. The learned EDRL-MEA embeddings are subsequently used to train an emotion classifier using clean samples from publicly available datasets, and are evaluated on unseen noisy and cross-corpus speech samples. Improved performance under these challenging conditions demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: As robots become more integrated into society, detecting robot errors is essential for effective human-robot interaction (HRI). When a robot fails repeatedly, how can it know when to change its behavior? Humans naturally respond to robot errors through verbal and nonverbal cues that intensify over successive failures-from confusion and subtle speech changes to visible frustration and impatience. While prior work shows that human reactions can indicate robot failures, few studies examine how these evolving responses reveal successive failures. This research uses machine learning to recognize stages of robot failure from human reactions. In a study with 26 participants interacting with a robot that made repeated conversational errors, behavioral features were extracted from video data to train models for individual users. The best model achieved 93.5% accuracy for detecting errors and 84.1% for classifying successive failures. Modeling the progression of human reactions enhances error detection and understanding of repeated interaction breakdowns in HRI.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies continue to advance, protecting human autonomy and promoting ethical decision-making are essential to fostering trust and accountability. Human agency (the capacity of individuals to make informed decisions) should be actively preserved and reinforced by AI systems. This paper examines strategies for designing AI systems that uphold fundamental rights, strengthen human agency, and embed effective human oversight mechanisms. It discusses key oversight models, including Human-in-Command (HIC), Human-in-the-Loop (HITL), and Human-on-the-Loop (HOTL), and proposes a risk-based framework to guide the implementation of these mechanisms. By linking the level of AI model risk to the appropriate form of human oversight, the paper underscores the critical role of human involvement in the responsible deployment of AI, balancing technological innovation with the protection of individual values and rights. In doing so, it aims to ensure that AI technologies are used responsibly, safeguarding individual autonomy while maximizing societal benefits.

Abstract: Learning from demonstrations enables experts to teach robots complex tasks using interfaces such as kinesthetic teaching, joystick control, and sim-to-real transfer. However, these interfaces often constrain the expert's ability to demonstrate optimal behavior due to indirect control, setup restrictions, and hardware safety. For example, a joystick can move a robotic arm only in a 2D plane, even though the robot operates in a higher-dimensional space. As a result, the demonstrations collected by constrained experts lead to suboptimal performance of the learned policies. This raises a key question: Can a robot learn a better policy than the one demonstrated by a constrained expert? We address this by allowing the agent to go beyond direct imitation of expert actions and explore shorter and more efficient trajectories. We use the demonstrations to infer a state-only reward signal that measures task progress, and self-label reward for unknown states using temporal interpolation. Our approach outperforms common imitation learning in both sample efficiency and task completion time. On a real WidowX robotic arm, it completes the task in 12 seconds, 10x faster than behavioral cloning, as shown in real-robot videos on https://sites.google.com/view/constrainedexpert .

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new approach called MemLoss to improve the adversarial training of machine learning models. MemLoss leverages previously generated adversarial examples, referred to as 'Memory Adversarial Examples,' to enhance model robustness and accuracy without compromising performance on clean data. By using these examples across training epochs, MemLoss provides a balanced improvement in both natural accuracy and adversarial robustness. Experimental results on multiple datasets, including CIFAR-10, demonstrate that our method achieves better accuracy compared to existing adversarial training methods while maintaining strong robustness against attacks.

Abstract: Visual grouping -- operationalized via instance segmentation, visual grounding, and object detection -- underpins applications from robotic perception to photo editing. Large annotated datasets are costly, biased in coverage, and hard to scale. Synthetic data are promising but often lack flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity.
  We present SOS, a simple and scalable data synthesis pipeline based on an object-centric composition strategy. It pastes high-quality synthetic object segments into new images using structured layout priors and generative relighting, producing accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring expressions. Models trained on 100000 synthetic images from SOS outperform those trained on larger real-image datasets such as GRIT (20M) and V3Det (200K) on detection and grounding tasks, achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS detection and +8.4 $N_{\text{Acc}}$ on gRefCOCO grounding. SOS enables controllable dataset construction and improves generalization in both low-data and closed-vocabulary settings. Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments yields strong performance across real-data scales and even larger gains under extremely limited real data (for example, +3.83 $AP_{\text{rare}}$ on LVIS instance segmentation and +6.59 AP with a 1 percent COCO setup). This controllability also supports targeted data generation for challenging intra-class referring in visual grounding.

<title>On the Fairness of Privacy Protection: Measuring and Mitigating the Disparity of Group Privacy Risks for Differentially Private Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in conventional fairness-aware machine learning (ML) and differentially private ML (DPML), the fairness of privacy protection across groups remains underexplored. Existing studies have proposed methods to assess group privacy risks, but these are based on the average-case privacy risks of data records. Such approaches may underestimate the group privacy risks, thereby potentially underestimating the disparity across group privacy risks. Moreover, the current method for assessing the worst-case privacy risks of data records is time-consuming, limiting their practical applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel membership inference game that can efficiently audit the approximate worst-case privacy risks of data records. Experimental results demonstrate that our method provides a more stringent measurement of group privacy risks, yielding a reliable assessment of the disparity in group privacy risks. Furthermore, to promote privacy protection fairness in DPML, we enhance the standard DP-SGD algorithm with an adaptive group-specific gradient clipping strategy, inspired by the design of canaries in differential privacy auditing studies. Extensive experiments confirm that our algorithm effectively reduces the disparity in group privacy risks, thereby enhancing the fairness of privacy protection in DPML.

Abstract: Scarcity of annotated data, particularly for rare or atypical morphologies, present significant challenges for cell and nuclei segmentation in computational pathology. While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly, synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention, enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples, exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets, directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models. Thereby, we pave the way for broader application of generative models in computational pathology.

Abstract: Personalized news recommendations have become a standard feature of large news aggregation services, optimizing user engagement through automated content selection. In contrast, legacy news media often approach personalization cautiously, striving to balance technological innovation with core editorial values. As a result, online platforms of traditional news outlets typically combine editorially curated content with algorithmically selected articles - a strategy we term controlled personalization. In this industry paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of controlled personalization through an A/B test conducted on the website of a major Norwegian legacy news organization. Our findings indicate that even a modest level of personalization yields substantial benefits. Specifically, we observe that users exposed to personalized content demonstrate higher click-through rates and reduced navigation effort, suggesting improved discovery of relevant content. Moreover, our analysis reveals that controlled personalization contributes to greater content diversity and catalog coverage and in addition reduces popularity bias. Overall, our results suggest that controlled personalization can successfully align user needs with editorial goals, offering a viable path for legacy media to adopt personalization technologies while upholding journalistic values.

Abstract: Connected health is a multidisciplinary approach focused on health management, prioritizing pa-tient needs in the creation of tools, services, and treatments. This paradigm ensures proactive and efficient care by facilitating the timely exchange of accurate patient information among all stake-holders in the care continuum. The rise of digital technologies and process innovations promises to enhance connected health by integrating various healthcare data sources. This integration aims to personalize care, predict health outcomes, and streamline patient management, though challeng-es remain, particularly in data architecture, application interoperability, and security. Data analytics can provide critical insights for informed decision-making and health co-creation, but solutions must prioritize end-users, including patients and healthcare professionals. This perspective was explored through an agile System Development Lifecycle in an EU-funded project aimed at developing an integrated AI-generated solution for managing cancer patients undergoing immunotherapy. This paper contributes with a collaborative digital framework integrating stakeholders across the care continuum, leveraging federated big data analytics and artificial intelligence for improved decision-making while ensuring privacy. Analytical capabilities, such as treatment recommendations and adverse event predictions, were validated using real-life data, achieving 70%-90% accuracy in a pilot study with the medical partners, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) enable deep learning for clinical predictions, but the optimal method for representing patient data remains unclear due to inconsistent evaluation practices. We present the first systematic benchmark to compare EHR representation methods, including multivariate time-series, event streams, and textual event streams for LLMs. This benchmark standardises data curation and evaluation across two distinct clinical settings: the MIMIC-IV dataset for ICU tasks (mortality, phenotyping) and the EHRSHOT dataset for longitudinal care (30-day readmission, 1-year pancreatic cancer). For each paradigm, we evaluate appropriate modelling families--including Transformers, MLP, LSTMs and Retain for time-series, CLMBR and count-based models for event streams, 8-20B LLMs for textual streams--and analyse the impact of feature pruning based on data missingness. Our experiments reveal that event stream models consistently deliver the strongest performance. Pre-trained models like CLMBR are highly sample-efficient in few-shot settings, though simpler count-based models can be competitive given sufficient data. Furthermore, we find that feature selection strategies must be adapted to the clinical setting: pruning sparse features improves ICU predictions, while retaining them is critical for longitudinal tasks. Our results, enabled by a unified and reproducible pipeline, provide practical guidance for selecting EHR representations based on the clinical context and data regime.

<title>On the Implicit Adversariality of Catastrophic Forgetting in Deep Continual Learning</title>

Abstract: Continual learning seeks the human-like ability to accumulate new skills in machine intelligence. Its central challenge is catastrophic forgetting, whose underlying cause has not been fully understood for deep networks. In this paper, we demystify catastrophic forgetting by revealing that the new-task training is implicitly an adversarial attack against the old-task knowledge. Specifically, the new-task gradients automatically and accurately align with the sharp directions of the old-task loss landscape, rapidly increasing the old-task loss. This adversarial alignment is intriguingly counter-intuitive because the sharp directions are too sparsely distributed to align with by chance. To understand it, we theoretically show that it arises from training's low-rank bias, which, through forward and backward propagation, confines the two directions into the same low-dimensional subspace, facilitating alignment. Gradient projection (GP) methods, a representative family of forgetting-mitigating methods, reduce adversarial alignment caused by forward propagation, but cannot address the alignment due to backward propagation. We propose backGP to address it, which reduces forgetting by 10.8% and improves accuracy by 12.7% on average over GP methods.

Abstract: Cricket shot classification from video sequences remains a challenging problem in sports video analysis, requiring effective modeling of both spatial and temporal features. This paper presents the first comprehensive baseline study comparing seven different deep learning approaches across four distinct research paradigms for cricket shot classification. We implement and systematically evaluate traditional CNN-LSTM architectures, attention-based models, vision transformers, transfer learning approaches, and modern EfficientNet-GRU combinations on a unified benchmark. A critical finding of our study is the significant performance gap between claims in academic literature and practical implementation results. While previous papers reported accuracies of 96\% (Balaji LRCN), 99.2\% (IJERCSE), and 93\% (Sensors), our standardized re-implementations achieve 46.0\%, 55.6\%, and 57.7\% respectively. Our modern SOTA approach, combining EfficientNet-B0 with a GRU-based temporal model, achieves 92.25\% accuracy, demonstrating that substantial improvements are possible with modern architectures and systematic optimization. All implementations follow modern MLOps practices with PyTorch Lightning, providing a reproducible research platform that exposes the critical importance of standardized evaluation protocols in sports video analysis research.

Abstract: Autonomous driving (AD) systems are becoming increasingly capable of handling complex tasks, mainly due to recent advances in deep learning and AI. As interactions between autonomous systems and humans increase, the interpretability of decision-making processes in driving systems becomes increasingly crucial for ensuring safe driving operations. Successful human-machine interaction requires understanding the underlying representations of the environment and the driving task, which remains a significant challenge in deep learning-based systems. To address this, we introduce the task of interpretability in maneuver prediction before they occur for driver safety, i.e., driver intent prediction (DIP), which plays a critical role in AD systems. To foster research in interpretable DIP, we curate the eXplainable Driving Action Anticipation Dataset (DAAD-X), a new multimodal, ego-centric video dataset to provide hierarchical, high-level textual explanations as causal reasoning for the driver's decisions. These explanations are derived from both the driver's eye-gaze and the ego-vehicle's perspective. Next, we propose Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM), a framework that generates spatio-temporally coherent explanations inherently, without relying on post-hoc techniques. Finally, through extensive evaluations of the proposed VCBM on the DAAD-X dataset, we demonstrate that transformer-based models exhibit greater interpretability than conventional CNN-based models. Additionally, we introduce a multilabel t-SNE visualization technique to illustrate the disentanglement and causal correlation among multiple explanations. Our data, code and models are available at: https://mukil07.github.io/VCBM.github.io/

<title>Multimodal Prompt Optimization: Why Not Leverage Multiple Modalities for MLLMs</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success, and their multimodal expansions (MLLMs) further unlock capabilities spanning images, videos, and other modalities beyond text. However, despite this shift, prompt optimization approaches, designed to reduce the burden of manual prompt crafting while maximizing performance, remain confined to text, ultimately limiting the full potential of MLLMs. Motivated by this gap, we introduce the new problem of multimodal prompt optimization, which expands the prior definition of prompt optimization to the multimodal space defined by the pairs of textual and non-textual prompts. To tackle this problem, we then propose the Multimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO), a unified framework that not only performs the joint optimization of multimodal prompts through alignment-preserving updates but also guides the selection process of candidate prompts by leveraging earlier evaluations as priors in a Bayesian-based selection strategy. Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities that go beyond text, such as images, videos, and even molecules, we demonstrate that MPO outperforms leading text-only optimization methods, establishing multimodal prompt optimization as a crucial step to realizing the potential of MLLMs.

Abstract: When performing reasoning tasks with user-specific requirements, such as strict output formats, large language models (LLMs) often prioritize reasoning over adherence to detailed instructions. Fine-tuning LLMs on supervised datasets to address this is impractical due to high computational costs and limited parameter access. To tackle this, we propose DICE, a lightweight framework that guides small language models (SLMs) to refine LLMs' outputs through chain-of-thought (CoT) correction. DICE decouples the process by first prompting LLMs to generate natural language responses, then using trained SLMs to analyze and refine these outputs to meet structured output specifications. This framework preserves LLMs' broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities while ensuring the outputs conform to user demands. Specifically, DICE first constructs structured CoT adaptation datasets via a two-stage method and subsequently applies a dual-tuning strategy to fine-tune SLMs for generating structured outputs in an analyze-then-answer pattern. Experiments demonstrate that DICE improves the average format accuracy and content correctness of LLM outputs by 35.4\% and 29.4\%, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance over other competitive baselines.

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions such as haze, rain, and snow significantly degrade the quality of images and videos, posing serious challenges to intelligent transportation systems (ITS) that rely on visual input. These degradations affect critical applications including autonomous driving, traffic monitoring, and surveillance. This survey presents a comprehensive review of image and video restoration techniques developed to mitigate weather-induced visual impairments. We categorize existing approaches into traditional prior-based methods and modern data-driven models, including CNNs, transformers, diffusion models, and emerging vision-language models (VLMs). Restoration strategies are further classified based on their scope: single-task models, multi-task/multi-weather systems, and all-in-one frameworks capable of handling diverse degradations. In addition, we discuss day and night time restoration challenges, benchmark datasets, and evaluation protocols. The survey concludes with an in-depth discussion on limitations in current research and outlines future directions such as mixed/compound-degradation restoration, real-time deployment, and agentic AI frameworks. This work aims to serve as a valuable reference for advancing weather-resilient vision systems in smart transportation environments. Lastly, to stay current with rapid advancements in this field, we will maintain regular updates of the latest relevant papers and their open-source implementations at https://github.com/ChaudharyUPES/A-comprehensive-review-on-Multi-weather-restoration

Abstract: Shoulder disorders, such as frozen shoulder (a.k.a., adhesive capsulitis), are common conditions affecting the health of people worldwide, and have a high incidence rate among the elderly and workers engaged in repetitive shoulder tasks. In regions with scarce medical resources, achieving early and accurate diagnosis poses significant challenges, and there is an urgent need for low-cost and easily scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions. This research introduces videos captured by consumer-grade devices as the basis for diagnosis, reducing the cost for users. We focus on the innovative application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the preliminary diagnosis of shoulder disorders and propose a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework (HMVDx). This framework divides the two tasks of action understanding and disease diagnosis, which are respectively completed by two MLLMs. In addition to traditional evaluation indicators, this work proposes a novel metric called Usability Index by the logical process of medical decision-making (action recognition, movement diagnosis, and final diagnosis). This index evaluates the effectiveness of MLLMs in the medical field from the perspective of the entire medical diagnostic pathway, revealing the potential value of low-cost MLLMs in medical applications for medical practitioners. In experimental comparisons, the accuracy of HMVDx in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries has increased by 79.6\% compared with direct video diagnosis, a significant technical contribution to future research on the application of MLLMs for video understanding in the medical field.

Abstract: Effectively identifying threats and mitigating their potential damage during crisis situations, such as natural disasters or violent attacks, is paramount for safeguarding endangered individuals. To tackle these challenges, AI has been used in assisting humans in emergency situations. Still, the use of NLP techniques remains limited and mostly focuses on classification tasks. The significant potential of timely warning message generation using NLG architectures, however, has been largely overlooked. In this paper we present CrisiText, the first large-scale dataset for the generation of warning messages across 13 different types of crisis scenarios. The dataset contains more than 400,000 warning messages (spanning almost 18,000 crisis situations) aimed at assisting civilians during and after such events. To generate the dataset, we started from existing crisis descriptions and created chains of events related to the scenarios. Each event was then paired with a warning message. The generations follow experts' written guidelines to ensure correct terminology and factuality of their suggestions. Additionally, each message is accompanied by three suboptimal warning types to allow for the study of different NLG approaches. To this end, we conducted a series of experiments comparing supervised fine-tuning setups with preference alignment, zero-shot, and few-shot approaches. We further assessed model performance in out-of-distribution scenarios and evaluated the effectiveness of an automatic post-editor.

Abstract: Learning-based motion planning can quickly generate near-optimal trajectories. However, it often requires either large training datasets or costly collection of human demonstrations. This work proposes an alternative approach that quickly generates smooth, near-optimal collision-free 3D Cartesian trajectories from a single artificial demonstration. The demonstration is encoded as a Dynamic Movement Primitive (DMP) and iteratively reshaped using policy-based reinforcement learning to create a diverse trajectory dataset for varying obstacle configurations. This dataset is used to train a neural network that takes as inputs the task parameters describing the obstacle dimensions and location, derived automatically from a point cloud, and outputs the DMP parameters that generate the trajectory. The approach is validated in simulation and real-robot experiments, outperforming a RRT-Connect baseline in terms of computation and execution time, as well as trajectory length, while supporting multi-modal trajectory generation for different obstacle geometries and end-effector dimensions. Videos and the implementation code are available at https://github.com/DominikUrbaniak/obst-avoid-dmp-pi2.

Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant threat to the reliable evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs). This issue arises when benchmark samples may inadvertently appear in training sets, compromising the validity of reported performance. While detection methods have been developed for the pre-training and Supervised Fine-Tuning stages, a critical research gap exists for the increasingly significant phase of Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training. As RL post-training becomes pivotal for advancing LLM reasoning, the absence of specialized contamination detection methods in this paradigm presents a critical vulnerability. To address this, we conduct the first systematic study of data detection within RL post-training scenario and propose Self-Critique. Our method is motivated by a key observation: after RL phase, the output entropy distribution of LLMs tends to collapse into highly specific and sparse modes. Self-Critique probes for the underlying policy collapse, i.e., the model's convergence to a narrow reasoning path, which causes this entropy reduction. To facilitate this research, we also introduce RL-MIA, a benchmark constructed to simulate this specific contamination scenario. Extensive experiments show that Self-Critique significantly outperforms baseline methods across multiple models and contamination tasks, achieving an AUC improvement of up to 30%. Whereas existing methods are close to a random guess for RL-phase contamination, our method makes detection possible.

Abstract: We introduce SynthID-Image, a deep learning-based system for invisibly watermarking AI-generated imagery. This paper documents the technical desiderata, threat models, and practical challenges of deploying such a system at internet scale, addressing key requirements of effectiveness, fidelity, robustness, and security. SynthID-Image has been used to watermark over ten billion images and video frames across Google's services and its corresponding verification service is available to trusted testers. For completeness, we present an experimental evaluation of an external model variant, SynthID-O, which is available through partnerships. We benchmark SynthID-O against other post-hoc watermarking methods from the literature, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both visual quality and robustness to common image perturbations. While this work centers on visual media, the conclusions on deployment, constraints, and threat modeling generalize to other modalities, including audio. This paper provides a comprehensive documentation for the large-scale deployment of deep learning-based media provenance systems.

<title>Inflated Excellence or True Performance? Rethinking Medical Diagnostic Benchmarks with Dynamic Evaluation</title>

Abstract: Medical diagnostics is a high-stakes and complex domain that is critical to patient care. However, current evaluations of large language models (LLMs) are fundamentally misaligned with real-world clinical practice. Most of them rely on static benchmarks derived from public medical exam items, which tend to overestimate model performance and ignore the difference between textbook cases and the ambiguous, varying conditions in the real world. Recent efforts toward dynamic evaluation offer a promising alternative, but their improvements are limited to superficial perturbations and a narrow focus on accuracy. To address these gaps, we propose DyReMe, a dynamic benchmark for medical diagnostics that better reflects real clinical practice. Unlike static exam-style questions, DyReMe generates fresh, consultation-like cases that introduce distractors such as differential diagnoses and common misdiagnosis factors. It also varies expression styles to mimic diverse real-world query habits. Beyond accuracy, DyReMe evaluates LLMs on three additional clinically relevant dimensions: veracity, helpfulness, and consistency. Our experiments demonstrate that this dynamic approach yields more challenging and realistic assessments, revealing significant misalignments between the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs and real clinical practice. These findings highlight the urgent need for evaluation frameworks that better reflect the demands of trustworthy medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Training expert LLMs in domains with scarce data is difficult, often relying on multiple-choice questions (MCQs). However, standard outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) on MCQs is risky. While it may improve accuracy, we observe it often degrades reasoning quality such as logical consistency. Existing solutions to supervise reasoning, such as large-scale Process Reward Models (PRMs), are prohibitively expensive. To address this, we propose CLARity, a cost-effective RL framework that enhances reasoning quality using only a small, general-purpose LLM. CLARity integrates a consistency-aware reward mechanism with a 2-stage refine-then-monitor training pipeline to enhance reasoning consistency, and a dynamic data reformulation strategy to to better exploit limited data. Experiments demonstrate that CLARity improves response consistency by 16.5% and accuracy by 7.5% over baselines. Human evaluations further confirm holistic improvements in coherence and professionalism.

<title>CapGeo: A Caption-Assisted Approach to Geometric Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Geometric reasoning remains a core challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Even the most advanced closed-source systems, such as GPT-O3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro, still struggle to solve geometry problems reliably, despite exhibiting strong textual reasoning abilities on tasks like the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). This gap suggests that the bottleneck lies in understanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself. Since geometric figures can often be faithfully described in concise textual form, converting visual content into captions offers a promising direction. Motivated by this insight, we introduce CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that bridges visual and textual modalities. Experiments show substantial improvements when models are equipped with captions: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improves from 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, while Claude-Opus-4 rises from 44.8% to 73.0%. To systematically evaluate and identify high-quality geometric captioning models, we further propose CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 curated figure-caption pairs. Crucially, CapGeo-Bench incorporates a keypoint-based evaluation metric that correlates strongly with downstream CapGeo performance, enabling reliable assessment of geometric captioning ability. Together, our framework and benchmark highlight a new pathway toward advancing geometric reasoning in MLLMs.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform healthcare by supporting more accurate diagnoses and personalized treatments. However, its adoption in practice remains constrained by fragmented data sources, strict privacy rules, and the technical complexity of building reliable clinical systems. To address these challenges, we introduce a model driven engineering (MDE) framework designed specifically for healthcare AI. The framework relies on formal metamodels, domain-specific languages (DSLs), and automated transformations to move from high level specifications to running software. At its core is the Medical Interoperability Language (MILA), a graphical DSL that enables clinicians and data scientists to define queries and machine learning pipelines using shared ontologies. When combined with a federated learning architecture, MILA allows institutions to collaborate without exchanging raw patient data, ensuring semantic consistency across sites while preserving privacy. We evaluate this approach in a multi center cancer immunotherapy study. The generated pipelines delivered strong predictive performance, with support vector machines achieving up to 98.5 percent and 98.3 percent accuracy in key tasks, while substantially reducing manual coding effort. These findings suggest that MDE principles metamodeling, semantic integration, and automated code generation can provide a practical path toward interoperable, reproducible, and trustworthy digital health platforms.

Abstract: Current Chain-of-Thought (CoT) verification methods predict reasoning correctness based on outputs (black-box) or activations (gray-box), but offer limited insight into why a computation fails. We introduce a white-box method: Circuit-based Reasoning Verification (CRV). We hypothesize that attribution graphs of correct CoT steps, viewed as execution traces of the model's latent reasoning circuits, possess distinct structural fingerprints from those of incorrect steps. By training a classifier on structural features of these graphs, we show that these traces contain a powerful signal of reasoning errors. Our white-box approach yields novel scientific insights unattainable by other methods. (1) We demonstrate that structural signatures of error are highly predictive, establishing the viability of verifying reasoning directly via its computational graph. (2) We find these signatures to be highly domain-specific, revealing that failures in different reasoning tasks manifest as distinct computational patterns. (3) We provide evidence that these signatures are not merely correlational; by using our analysis to guide targeted interventions on individual transcoder features, we successfully correct the model's faulty reasoning. Our work shows that, by scrutinizing a model's computational process, we can move from simple error detection to a deeper, causal understanding of LLM reasoning.

Abstract: We close open theoretical gaps in Multi-Agent Imitation Learning (MAIL) by characterizing the limits of non-interactive MAIL and presenting the first interactive algorithm with near-optimal sample complexity. In the non-interactive setting, we prove a statistical lower bound that identifies the all-policy deviation concentrability coefficient as the fundamental complexity measure, and we show that Behavior Cloning (BC) is rate-optimal. For the interactive setting, we introduce a framework that combines reward-free reinforcement learning with interactive MAIL and instantiate it with an algorithm, MAIL-WARM. It improves the best previously known sample complexity from $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-8})$ to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2}),$ matching the dependence on $\varepsilon$ implied by our lower bound. Finally, we provide numerical results that support our theory and illustrate, in environments such as grid worlds, where Behavior Cloning fails to learn.

Abstract: We study the problem of constructing Steiner Minimal Trees (SMTs) in hyperbolic space. Exact SMT computation is NP-hard, and existing hyperbolic heuristics such as HyperSteiner are deterministic and often get trapped in locally suboptimal configurations. We introduce Randomized HyperSteiner (RHS), a stochastic Delaunay triangulation heuristic that incorporates randomness into the expansion process and refines candidate trees via Riemannian gradient descent optimization. Experiments on synthetic data sets and a real-world single-cell transcriptomic data show that RHS outperforms Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), Neighbour Joining, and vanilla HyperSteiner (HS). In near-boundary configurations, RHS can achieve a 32% reduction in total length over HS, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in diverse data regimes.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performance, their enormous parameter counts hinder deployment on resource-constrained hardware. Low-rank compression can reduce both memory usage and computational demand, but applying a uniform compression ratio across all layers often leads to significant performance degradation, and previous methods perform poorly during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Fine-grained Low-Rank Compressor (FLRC), which efficiently determines an optimal rank allocation for each layer, and incorporates progressive low-rank decoding to maintain text generation quality. Comprehensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of FLRC, achieving up to a 17% improvement in ROUGE-L on summarization tasks compared to state-of-the-art low-rank compression methods, establishing a more robust and efficient framework to improve LLM inference.

Abstract: In the era of exploding survey volumes, traditional methods of spectroscopic analysis are being pushed to their limits. In response, we develop deep-REMAP, a novel deep learning framework that utilizes a regularized, multi-task approach to predict stellar atmospheric parameters from observed spectra. We train a deep convolutional neural network on the PHOENIX synthetic spectral library and use transfer learning to fine-tune the model on a small subset of observed FGK dwarf spectra from the MARVELS survey. We then apply the model to 732 uncharacterized FGK giant candidates from the same survey. When validated on 30 MARVELS calibration stars, deep-REMAP accurately recovers the effective temperature ($T_{\rm{eff}}$), surface gravity ($\log \rm{g}$), and metallicity ([Fe/H]), achieving a precision of, for instance, approximately 75 K in $T_{\rm{eff}}$. By combining an asymmetric loss function with an embedding loss, our regression-as-classification framework is interpretable, robust to parameter imbalances, and capable of capturing non-Gaussian uncertainties. While developed for MARVELS, the deep-REMAP framework is extensible to other surveys and synthetic libraries, demonstrating a powerful and automated pathway for stellar characterization.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.09378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent efforts to accelerate LLM pretraining have focused on computationally-efficient approximations that exploit second-order structure. This raises a key question for large-scale training: how much performance is forfeited by these approximations? To probe this question, we establish a practical upper bound on iteration complexity by applying full Gauss-Newton (GN) preconditioning to transformer models of up to 150M parameters. Our experiments show that full GN updates yield substantial gains over existing optimizers, achieving a 5.4x reduction in training iterations compared to strong baselines like SOAP and Muon. Furthermore, we find that a precise layerwise GN preconditioner, which ignores cross-layer information, nearly matches the performance of the full GN method. Collectively, our results suggest: (1) the GN approximation is highly effective for preconditioning, implying higher-order loss terms may not be critical for convergence speed; (2) the layerwise Hessian structure contains sufficient information to achieve most of these potential gains; and (3) a significant performance gap exists between current approximate methods and an idealized layerwise oracle.

Abstract: Although softmax attention drives state-of-the-art performance for sequence models, its quadratic complexity limits scalability, motivating linear alternatives such as state space models (SSMs). While these alternatives improve efficiency, their fundamental differences in information processing remain poorly understood. In this work, we leverage the recently proposed dynamical systems framework to represent softmax, norm and linear attention as dynamical systems, enabling a structured comparison with SSMs by analyzing their respective eigenvalue spectra. Since eigenvalues capture essential aspects of dynamical system behavior, we conduct an extensive empirical analysis across diverse sequence models and benchmarks. We first show that eigenvalues influence essential aspects of memory and long-range dependency modeling, revealing spectral signatures that align with task requirements. Building on these insights, we then investigate how architectural modifications in sequence models impact both eigenvalue spectra and task performance. This correspondence further strengthens the position of eigenvalue analysis as a principled metric for interpreting, understanding, and ultimately improving the capabilities of sequence models.

arXiv:2510.09389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep sequence models, ranging from Transformers and State Space Models (SSMs) to more recent approaches such as gated linear RNNs, fundamentally compute outputs as linear combinations of past value vectors. To draw insights and systematically compare such architectures, we develop a unified framework that makes this output operation explicit, by casting the linear combination coefficients as the outputs of autonomous linear dynamical systems driven by impulse inputs. This viewpoint, in spirit substantially different from approaches focusing on connecting linear RNNs with linear attention, reveals a common mathematical theme across diverse architectures and crucially captures softmax attention, on top of RNNs, SSMs, and related models. In contrast to new model proposals that are commonly evaluated on benchmarks, we derive design principles linking architectural choices to model properties. Thereby identifying tradeoffs between expressivity and efficient implementation, geometric constraints on input selectivity, and stability conditions for numerically stable training and information retention. By connecting several insights and observations from recent literature, the framework both explains empirical successes of recent designs and provides guiding principles for systematically designing new sequence model architectures.

Abstract: Establishing shared goals is a fundamental step in human-AI communication. However, ambiguities can lead to outputs that seem correct but fail to reflect the speaker's intent. In this paper, we explore this issue with a focus on the data visualization domain, where ambiguities in natural language impact the generation of code that visualizes data. The availability of multiple views on the contextual (e.g., the intended plot and the code rendering the plot) allows for a unique and comprehensive analysis of diverse ambiguity types. We develop a taxonomy of types of ambiguity that arise in this task and propose metrics to quantify them. Using Matplotlib problems from the DS-1000 dataset, we demonstrate that our ambiguity metrics better correlate with human annotations than uncertainty baselines. Our work also explores how multi-turn dialogue can reduce ambiguity, therefore, improve code accuracy by better matching user goals. We evaluate three pragmatic models to inform our dialogue strategies: Gricean Cooperativity, Discourse Representation Theory, and Questions under Discussion. A simulated user study reveals how pragmatic dialogues reduce ambiguity and enhance code accuracy, highlighting the value of multi-turn exchanges in code generation.

Abstract: Accurately predicting conversion rates (CVR) for low-activity users remains a fundamental challenge in large-scale e-commerce recommender systems.Existing approaches face three critical limitations: (i) reliance on noisy and unreliable behavioral signals; (ii) insufficient user-level information due to the lack of diverse interaction data; and (iii) a systemic training bias toward high-activity users that overshadows the needs of low-activity users.To address these challenges, we propose ChoirRec, a novel framework that leverages the semantic capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct semantic user groups and enhance CVR prediction for low-activity users.With a dual-channel architecture designed for robust cross-user knowledge transfer, ChoirRec comprises three components: (i) a Semantic Group Generation module that utilizes LLMs to form reliable, cross-activity user clusters, thereby filtering out noisy signals; (ii) a Group-aware Hierarchical Representation module that enriches sparse user embeddings with informative group-level priors to mitigate data insufficiency; and (iii) a Group-aware Multi-granularity Modual that employs a dual-channel architecture and adaptive fusion mechanism to ensure effective learning and utilization of group knowledge. We conduct extensive offline and online experiments on Taobao, a leading industrial-scale e-commerce platform.ChoirRec improves GAUC by 1.16\% in offline evaluations, while online A/B testing reveals a 7.24\% increase in order volume, highlighting its substantial practical value in real-world applications.

Abstract: The "pre-train, prompt'' paradigm, designed to bridge the gap between pre-training tasks and downstream objectives, has been extended from the NLP domain to the graph domain and has achieved remarkable progress. Current mainstream graph prompt-tuning methods modify input or output features using learnable prompt vectors. However, existing approaches are confined to single-granularity (e.g., node-level or subgraph-level) during prompt generation, overlooking the inherently multi-scale structural information in graph data, which limits the diversity of prompt semantics. To address this issue, we pioneer the integration of multi-scale information into graph prompt and propose a Multi-Scale Graph Chain-of-Thought (MSGCOT) prompting framework. Specifically, we design a lightweight, low-rank coarsening network to efficiently capture multi-scale structural features as hierarchical basis vectors for prompt generation. Subsequently, mimicking human cognition from coarse-to-fine granularity, we dynamically integrate multi-scale information at each reasoning step, forming a progressive coarse-to-fine prompt chain. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that MSGCOT outperforms the state-of-the-art single-granularity graph prompt-tuning method, particularly in few-shot scenarios, showcasing superior performance.

Abstract: Named entities are fundamental building blocks of knowledge in text, grounding factual information and structuring relationships within language. Despite their importance, it remains unclear how Large Language Models (LLMs) internally represent entities. Prior research has primarily examined explicit relationships, but little is known about entity representations themselves. We introduce entity mention reconstruction as a novel framework for studying how LLMs encode and manipulate entities. We investigate whether entity mentions can be generated from internal representations, how multi-token entities are encoded beyond last-token embeddings, and whether these representations capture relational knowledge. Our proposed method, leveraging _task vectors_, allows to consistently generate multi-token mentions from various entity representations derived from the LLMs hidden states. We thus introduce the _Entity Lens_, extending the _logit-lens_ to predict multi-token mentions. Our results bring new evidence that LLMs develop entity-specific mechanisms to represent and manipulate any multi-token entities, including those unseen during training. Our code is avalable at https://github.com/VictorMorand/EntityRepresentations .

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative study of context management strategies for end-to-end Spoken Dialog State Tracking using Speech-LLMs. We systematically evaluate traditional multimodal context (combining text history and spoken current turn), full spoken history, and compressed spoken history approaches. Our experiments on the SpokenWOZ corpus demonstrate that providing the full spoken conversation as input yields the highest performance among models of similar size, significantly surpassing prior methods. Furthermore, we show that attention-pooling-based compression of the spoken history offers a strong trade-off, maintaining competitive accuracy with reduced context size. Detailed analysis confirms that improvements stem from more effective context utilization.

Abstract: We study an online stochastic matching problem in which an algorithm sequentially matches $U$ users to $K$ arms, aiming to maximize cumulative reward over $T$ rounds under budget constraints. Without structural assumptions, computing the optimal matching is NP-hard, making online learning computationally infeasible. To overcome this barrier, we focus on \emph{single-peaked preferences} -- a well-established structure in social choice theory, where users' preferences are unimodal with respect to a common order over arms. We devise an efficient algorithm for the offline budgeted matching problem, and leverage it into an efficient online algorithm with a regret of $\tilde O(UKT^{2/3})$. Our approach relies on a novel PQ tree-based order approximation method. If the single-peaked structure is known, we develop an efficient UCB-like algorithm that achieves a regret bound of $\tilde O(U\sqrt{TK})$.

Abstract: Interest in robotics for forest management is growing, but perception in complex, natural environments remains a significant hurdle. Conditions such as heavy occlusion, variable lighting, and dense vegetation pose challenges to automated systems, which are essential for precision forestry, biodiversity monitoring, and the automation of forestry equipment. These tasks rely on advanced perceptual capabilities, such as detection and fine-grained species classification of individual trees. Yet, existing datasets are inadequate to develop such perception systems, as they often focus on urban settings or a limited number of species. To address this, we present SilvaScenes, a new dataset for instance segmentation of tree species from under-canopy images. Collected across five bioclimatic domains in Quebec, Canada, SilvaScenes features 1476 trees from 24 species with annotations from forestry experts. We demonstrate the relevance and challenging nature of our dataset by benchmarking modern deep learning approaches for instance segmentation. Our results show that, while tree segmentation is easy, with a top mean average precision (mAP) of 67.65%, species classification remains a significant challenge with an mAP of only 35.69%. Our dataset and source code will be available at https://github.com/norlab-ulaval/SilvaScenes.

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) with generative models, such as diffusion and flow matching, has enabled robots to perform complex, long-horizon tasks. However, distribution shifts from unseen environments or compounding action errors can still cause unpredictable and unsafe behavior, leading to task failure. Early failure prediction during runtime is therefore essential for deploying robots in human-centered and safety-critical environments. We propose FIPER, a general framework for Failure Prediction at Runtime for generative IL policies that does not require failure data. FIPER identifies two key indicators of impending failure: (i) out-of-distribution (OOD) observations detected via random network distillation in the policy's embedding space, and (ii) high uncertainty in generated actions measured by a novel action-chunk entropy score. Both failure prediction scores are calibrated using a small set of successful rollouts via conformal prediction. A failure alarm is triggered when both indicators, aggregated over short time windows, exceed their thresholds. We evaluate FIPER across five simulation and real-world environments involving diverse failure modes. Our results demonstrate that FIPER better distinguishes actual failures from benign OOD situations and predicts failures more accurately and earlier than existing methods. We thus consider this work an important step towards more interpretable and safer generative robot policies. Code, data and videos are available at https://tum-lsy.github.io/fiper_website.

Abstract: AI control protocols serve as a defense mechanism to stop untrusted LLM agents from causing harm in autonomous settings. Prior work treats this as a security problem, stress testing with exploits that use the deployment context to subtly complete harmful side tasks, such as backdoor insertion. In practice, most AI control protocols are fundamentally based on LLM monitors, which can become a central point of failure. We study adaptive attacks by an untrusted model that knows the protocol and the monitor model, which is plausible if the untrusted model was trained with a later knowledge cutoff or can search for this information autonomously. We instantiate a simple adaptive attack vector by which the attacker embeds publicly known or zero-shot prompt injections in the model outputs. Using this tactic, frontier models consistently evade diverse monitors and complete malicious tasks on two main AI control benchmarks. The attack works universally against current protocols that rely on a monitor. Furthermore, the recent Defer-to-Resample protocol even backfires, as its resampling amplifies the prompt injection and effectively reframes it as a best-of-$n$ attack. In general, adaptive attacks on monitor models represent a major blind spot in current control protocols and should become a standard component of evaluations for future AI control mechanisms.

Abstract: Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) remains a critical problem in robotics and autonomous systems, where agents must navigate shared spaces efficiently while avoiding conflicts. Traditional centralized algorithms that have global information, such as Conflict-Based Search (CBS), provide high-quality solutions but become computationally expensive in large-scale scenarios due to the combinatorial explosion of conflicts that need resolution. Conversely, distributed approaches that have local information, particularly learning-based methods, offer better scalability by operating with relaxed information availability, yet often at the cost of solution quality. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework that combines decentralized path planning with a lightweight centralized coordinator. Our framework leverages reinforcement learning (RL) for decentralized planning, enabling agents to adapt their planning based on minimal, targeted alerts--such as static conflict-cell flags or brief conflict tracks--that are dynamically shared information from the central coordinator for effective conflict resolution. We empirically study the effect of the information available to an agent on its planning performance. Our approach reduces the inter-agent information sharing compared to fully centralized and distributed methods, while still consistently finding feasible, collision-free solutions--even in large-scale scenarios having higher agent counts.

Abstract: Modern conversational agents like ChatGPT and Alexa+ rely on predefined policies specifying metadata, response styles, and tool-usage rules. As these LLM-based systems expand to support diverse business and user queries, such policies, often implemented as in-context prompts, are becoming increasingly complex and lengthy, making faithful adherence difficult and imposing large fixed computational costs. With the rise of multimodal agents, policies that govern visual and multimodal behaviors are critical but remain understudied. Prior prompt-compression work mainly shortens task templates and demonstrations, while existing policy-alignment studies focus only on text-based safety rules. We introduce Multimodal Policy Internalization (MPI), a new task that internalizes reasoning-intensive multimodal policies into model parameters, enabling stronger policy-following without including the policy during inference. MPI poses unique data and algorithmic challenges. We build two datasets spanning synthetic and real-world decision-making and tool-using tasks and propose TriMPI, a three-stage training framework. TriMPI first injects policy knowledge via continual pretraining, then performs supervised finetuning, and finally applies PolicyRollout, a GRPO-style reinforcement learning extension that augments rollouts with policy-aware responses for grounded exploration. TriMPI achieves notable gains in end-to-end accuracy, generalization, and robustness to forgetting. As the first work on multimodal policy internalization, we provide datasets, training recipes, and comprehensive evaluations to foster future research.

Abstract: Kidneys are the filter of the human body. About 10% of the global population is thought to be affected by Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), which causes kidney function to decline. To protect in danger patients from additional kidney damage, effective risk evaluation of CKD and appropriate CKD monitoring are crucial. Due to quick and precise detection capabilities, Machine Learning models can help practitioners accomplish this goal efficiently; therefore, an enormous number of diagnosis systems and processes in the healthcare sector nowadays are relying on machine learning due to its disease prediction capability. In this study, we designed and suggested disease predictive computer-aided designs for the diagnosis of CKD. The dataset for CKD is attained from the repository of machine learning of UCL, with a few missing values; those are filled in using "mean-mode" and "Random sampling method" strategies. After successfully achieving the missing data, eight ML techniques (Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN, XGBoost, Decision Tree, and AdaBoost) were used to establish models, and the performance evaluation comparisons among the result accuracies are measured by the techniques to find the machine learning models with the highest accuracy. Among them, Random Forest as well as Logistic Regression showed an outstanding 99% accuracy, followed by the Ada Boost, XGBoost, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and SVM, whereas the KNN classifier model stands last with an accuracy of 73%.

Abstract: Robust precoding is efficiently feasible in frequency division duplex (FDD) systems by incorporating the learnt statistics of the propagation environment through a generative model. We build on previous work that successfully designed site-specific precoders based on a combination of Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). In this paper, by utilizing a vector quantized-variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE), we circumvent one of the key drawbacks of GMMs, i.e., the number of GMM components scales exponentially to the feedback bits. In addition, the deep learning architecture of the VQ-VAE allows us to jointly train the GNN together with VQ-VAE along with pilot optimization forming an end-to-end (E2E) model, resulting in considerable performance gains in sum rate for multi-user wireless systems. Simulations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed frameworks over the conventional methods involving the sub-discrete Fourier transform (DFT) pilot matrix and iterative precoder algorithms enabling the deployment of systems characterized by fewer pilots or feedback bits.

Abstract: In endovascular surgery, endovascular interventionists push a thin tube called a catheter, guided by a thin wire to a treatment site inside the patient's blood vessels to treat various conditions such as blood clots, aneurysms, and malformations. Guidewires with robotic tips can enhance maneuverability, but they present challenges in modeling and control. Automation of soft robotic guidewire navigation has the potential to overcome these challenges, increasing the precision and safety of endovascular navigation. In other surgical domains, end-to-end imitation learning has shown promising results. Thus, we develop a transformer-based imitation learning framework with goal conditioning, relative action outputs, and automatic contrast dye injections to enable generalizable soft robotic guidewire navigation in an aneurysm targeting task. We train the model on 36 different modular bifurcated geometries, generating 647 total demonstrations under simulated fluoroscopy, and evaluate it on three previously unseen vascular geometries. The model can autonomously drive the tip of the robot to the aneurysm location with a success rate of 83% on the unseen geometries, outperforming several baselines. In addition, we present ablation and baseline studies to evaluate the effectiveness of each design and data collection choice. Project website: https://softrobotnavigation.github.io/

Abstract: Interactive segmentation is a promising strategy for building robust, generalisable algorithms for volumetric medical image segmentation. However, inconsistent and clinically unrealistic evaluation hinders fair comparison and misrepresents real-world performance. We propose a clinically grounded methodology for defining evaluation tasks and metrics, and built a software framework for constructing standardised evaluation pipelines. We evaluate state-of-the-art algorithms across heterogeneous and complex tasks and observe that (i) minimising information loss when processing user interactions is critical for model robustness, (ii) adaptive-zooming mechanisms boost robustness and speed convergence, (iii) performance drops if validation prompting behaviour/budgets differ from training, (iv) 2D methods perform well with slab-like images and coarse targets, but 3D context helps with large or irregularly shaped targets, (v) performance of non-medical-domain models (e.g. SAM2) degrades with poor contrast and complex shapes.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) boosted by Reinforcement Learning from Verifier Reward (RLVR) have shown great power in problem solving, yet they often cause overthinking: excessive, meandering reasoning that inflates computational cost. Prior designs of penalization in RLVR manage to reduce token consumption while often harming model performance, which arises from the oversimplicity of token-level supervision. In this paper, we argue that the granularity of supervision plays a crucial role in balancing efficiency and accuracy, and propose Group Relative Segment Penalization (GRSP), a step-level method to regularize reasoning. Since preliminary analyses show that reasoning segments are strongly correlated with token consumption and model performance, we design a length-aware weighting mechanism across segment clusters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRSP achieves superior token efficiency without heavily compromising accuracy, especially the advantages with harder problems. Moreover, GRSP stabilizes RL training and scales effectively across model sizes.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are emerging as an efficient alternative to autoregressive models due to their ability to decode multiple tokens in parallel. However, aligning dLLMs with human preferences or task-specific rewards via reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging because their intractable log-likelihood precludes the direct application of standard policy gradient methods. While prior work uses surrogates like the evidence lower bound (ELBO), these one-sided approximations can introduce significant policy gradient bias. To address this, we propose the Sandwiched Policy Gradient (SPG) that leverages both an upper and a lower bound of the true log-likelihood. Experiments show that SPG significantly outperforms baselines based on ELBO or one-step estimation. Specifically, SPG improves the accuracy over state-of-the-art RL methods for dLLMs by 3.6% in GSM8K, 2.6% in MATH500, 18.4% in Countdown and 27.0% in Sudoku.

Abstract: Reasoning models have recently shown remarkable progress in domains such as math and coding. However, their expert-level abilities in math and coding contrast sharply with their performance in long-horizon, interactive tasks such as web navigation and computer/phone-use. Inspired by literature on human cognition, we argue that current AI agents need ''vicarious trial and error'' - the capacity to mentally simulate alternative futures before acting - in order to enhance their understanding and performance in complex interactive environments. We introduce Dyna-Mind, a two-stage training framework that explicitly teaches (V)LM agents to integrate such simulation into their reasoning. In stage 1, we introduce Reasoning with Simulations (ReSim), which trains the agent to generate structured reasoning traces from expanded search trees built from real experience gathered through environment interactions. ReSim thus grounds the agent's reasoning in faithful world dynamics and equips it with the ability to anticipate future states in its reasoning. In stage 2, we propose Dyna-GRPO, an online reinforcement learning method to further strengthen the agent's simulation and decision-making ability by using both outcome rewards and intermediate states as feedback from real rollouts. Experiments on two synthetic benchmarks (Sokoban and ALFWorld) and one realistic benchmark (AndroidWorld) demonstrate that (1) ReSim effectively infuses simulation ability into AI agents, and (2) Dyna-GRPO leverages outcome and interaction-level signals to learn better policies for long-horizon, planning-intensive tasks. Together, these results highlight the central role of simulation in enabling AI agents to reason, plan, and act more effectively in the ever more challenging environments.

Abstract: Today's generative models thrive with large amounts of supervised data and informative reward functions characterizing the quality of the generation. They work under the assumptions that the supervised data provides knowledge to pre-train the model, and the reward function provides dense information about how to further improve the generation quality and correctness. However, in the hardest instances of important problems, two problems arise: (1) the base generative model attains a near-zero reward signal, and (2) calls to the reward oracle are expensive. This setting poses a fundamentally different learning challenge than standard reward-based post-training. To address this, we propose BaNEL (Bayesian Negative Evidence Learning), an algorithm that post-trains the model using failed attempts only, while minimizing the number of reward evaluations (NREs). Our method is based on the idea that the problem of learning regularities underlying failures can be cast as another, in-loop generative modeling problem. We then leverage this model to assess whether new data resembles previously seen failures and steer the generation away from them. We show that BaNEL can improve model performance without observing a single successful sample on several sparse-reward tasks, outperforming existing novelty-bonus approaches by up to several orders of magnitude in success rate, while using fewer reward evaluations.

<title>Prompting Test-Time Scaling Is A Strong LLM Reasoning Data Augmentation</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities when provided with chain-of-thought exemplars, but curating large reasoning datasets remains laborious and resource-intensive. In this work, we introduce Prompting Test-Time Scaling (P-TTS), a simple yet effective inference-time data augmentation strategy for enhancing LLM reasoning through finetuning. Rather than collecting thousands or even millions of examples, P-TTS leverages a small pool of only 90 manually selected reasoning instances and systematically varies exemplar augmentation through principled instruction prompting intensities at test time to synthesize diverse reasoning trajectory contexts. Then we finetune the various sizes of Qwen-2.5 models on P-TTS data. Across a suite of mathematical reasoning AIME2024 & 25, MATH500, and GPQA-Diamond, our P-TTS-7B and 32B models outperform the prior competitive baselines like S1 and S1.1 (1K-shot), achieving absolute accuracy gains of +26.66% and +30.00% on AIME'24 (7B), and +13.34% and +6.67% on AIME'25 (7B); P-TTS-32B yields gains of +23.33% and +16.63% on AIME'24, and +26.63% and +3.33% on AIME'25 (vs. S1 and S1.1, respectively), with comparable or better performance on MATH500 and GPQA-Diamond. We further show that P-TTS enhances zero-shot generalization accuracy on out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks of Gaokao, Kaoyan, OlympiadBench, AMC23, GradeSchoolMath, and Minerva. Our analysis suggests that test-time scaling effectively explores the latent space of reasoning patterns, amplifying LLM problem-solving with minimal annotation overhead, and further unlocking the reasoning potential and capabilities of LLMs. Prompting Test-Time Scaling offers a practical, low-cost way to elicit LLM reasoning in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving domains.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) could power real-time assistants and autonomous agents, but they face a critical challenge: understanding near-infinite video streams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos with full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance on long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as they either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant recomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for real-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a unified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During inference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks, a short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text tokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning (SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks, which effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training on prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a new benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense, per-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM achieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time performance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy also enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning, improving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by +5.96. Code is available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/streaming-vlm.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel operator, termed the Y operator, to elevate control performance in Actor-Critic(AC) based reinforcement learning for systems governed by stochastic differential equations(SDEs). The Y operator ingeniously integrates the stochasticity of a class of child-mother system into the Critic network's loss function, yielding substantial advancements in the control performance of RL algorithms.Additionally, the Y operator elegantly reformulates the challenge of solving partial differential equations for the state-value function into a parallel problem for the drift and diffusion functions within the system's SDEs.A rigorous mathematical proof confirms the operator's validity.This transformation enables the Y Operator-based Reinforcement Learning(YORL) framework to efficiently tackle optimal control problems in both model-based and data-driven systems.The superiority of YORL is demonstrated through linear and nonlinear numerical examples showing its enhanced performance over existing methods post convergence.

Abstract: There is growing concern over the safety of powerful diffusion models (DMs), as they are often misused to produce inappropriate, not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content or generate copyrighted material or data of individuals who wish to be forgotten. Many existing methods tackle these issues by heavily relying on text-based negative prompts or extensively retraining DMs to eliminate certain features or samples. In this paper, we take a radically different approach, directly modifying the sampling trajectory by leveraging a negation set (e.g., unsafe images, copyrighted data, or datapoints needed to be excluded) to avoid specific regions of data distribution, without needing to retrain or fine-tune DMs. We formally derive the relationship between the expected denoised samples that are safe and those that are not safe, leading to our $\textit{safe}$ denoiser which ensures its final samples are away from the area to be negated. Inspired by the derivation, we develop a practical algorithm that successfully produces high-quality samples while avoiding negation areas of the data distribution in text-conditional, class-conditional, and unconditional image generation scenarios. These results hint at the great potential of our training-free safe denoiser for using DMs more safely.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has led to an exponential growth in research publications, creating an urgent need for efficient knowledge management and reasoning systems in this domain. We present a comprehensive knowledge-enhanced system for PSCs that integrates three key components. First, we develop Perovskite-KG, a domain-specific knowledge graph constructed from 1,517 research papers, containing 23,789 entities and 22,272 relationships. Second, we create two complementary datasets: Perovskite-Chat, comprising 55,101 high-quality question-answer pairs generated through a novel multi-agent framework, and Perovskite-Reasoning, containing 2,217 carefully curated materials science problems. Third, we introduce two specialized large language models: Perovskite-Chat-LLM for domain-specific knowledge assistance and Perovskite-Reasoning-LLM for scientific reasoning tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms existing models in both domain-specific knowledge retrieval and scientific reasoning tasks, providing researchers with effective tools for literature review, experimental design, and complex problem-solving in PSC research.

We present HA-VLN 2.0, a unified benchmark introducing explicit social-awareness constraints. Our contributions are: (i) a standardized task and metrics capturing both goal accuracy and personal-space adherence; (ii) HAPS 2.0 dataset and simulators modeling multi-human interactions, outdoor contexts, and finer language-motion alignment; (iii) benchmarks on 16,844 socially grounded instructions, revealing sharp performance drops of leading agents under human dynamics and partial observability; and (iv) real-world robot experiments validating sim-to-real transfer, with an open leaderboard enabling transparent comparison. Results show that explicit social modeling improves navigation robustness and reduces collisions, underscoring the necessity of human-centric approaches. By releasing datasets, simulators, baselines, and protocols, HA-VLN 2.0 provides a strong foundation for safe, socially responsible navigation research.

Abstract: Car-following models (CFMs) are fundamental to traffic flow analysis and autonomous driving. Although calibrated physics-based and trained data-driven CFMs can replicate human driving behavior, their reliance on specific datasets limits generalization across diverse scenarios and reduces reliability in real-world deployment. Moreover, these models typically focus on behavioral fidelity and do not support the explicit optimization of local and string stability, which are increasingly important for the safe and efficient operation of autonomous vehicles (AVs). To address these limitations, we propose a Knowledge-Informed Deep Learning (KIDL) paradigm that distills the generalization capabilities of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) into a lightweight and stability-aware neural architecture. LLMs are used to extract fundamental car-following knowledge beyond dataset-specific patterns, and this knowledge is transferred to a reliable, tractable, and computationally efficient model through knowledge distillation. KIDL also incorporates stability constraints directly into its training objective, ensuring that the resulting model not only emulates human-like behavior but also satisfies the local and string stability requirements essential for real-world AV deployment. We evaluate KIDL on the real-world NGSIM and HighD datasets, comparing its performance with representative physics-based, data-driven, and hybrid CFMs. Both empirical and theoretical results consistently demonstrate KIDL's superior behavioral generalization and traffic flow stability, offering a robust and scalable solution for next-generation traffic systems.

Abstract: Training effective Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for GUI agents typically depends on large-scale annotated datasets, whose collection is both labor-intensive and error-prone. We introduce K-step GUI Transition, a self-supervised inverse dynamics task in which VLMs learn GUI dynamics by predicting the initial action that causes a transition between two GUI states. This approach eliminates the need for natural language instructions and enables scalable dataset construction from existing GUI trajectories or automated exploration. Building on this task, we propose GUI-Shift, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that combines rule-based optimization with data filtering to improve VLM performance. We conduct extensive experiments using multiple VLM backbones across four benchmarks, spanning GUI task automation (AndroidControl, GUI Odyssey) and GUI grounding (ScreenSpot-v2, ScreenSpot-Pro). Our results show that training on GUI-Shift generalizes well to both GUI automation and grounding tasks, yielding up to an 11.2% increase in GUI automation accuracy. This study underscores the potential of self-supervised RL to leverage unlabeled GUI trajectories and offers a scalable alternative to training with annotated samples.

Abstract: LLMs often need effective configurations, like temperature and reasoning steps, to handle tasks requiring sophisticated reasoning and problem-solving, ranging from joke generation to mathematical reasoning. Existing prompting approaches usually adopt general-purpose, fixed configurations that work 'well enough' across tasks but seldom achieve task-specific optimality. To address this gap, we introduce AdaReasoner, an LLM-agnostic plugin designed for any LLM to automate adaptive reasoning configurations for tasks requiring different types of thinking. AdaReasoner is trained using a reinforcement learning (RL) framework, combining a factorized action space with a targeted exploration strategy, along with a pretrained reward model to optimize the policy model for reasoning configurations with only a few-shot guide. AdaReasoner is backed by theoretical guarantees and experiments of fast convergence and a sublinear policy gap. Across six different LLMs and a variety of reasoning tasks, it consistently outperforms standard baselines, preserves out-of-distribution robustness, and yield gains on knowledge-intensive tasks through tailored prompts.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning refers to the process of learning policies from fixed datasets, without requiring additional environment interaction. However, it often relies on well-defined reward functions, which are difficult and expensive to design. Human feedback is an appealing alternative, but its two common forms, expert demonstrations and preferences, have complementary limitations. Demonstrations provide stepwise supervision, but they are costly to collect and often reflect limited expert behavior modes. In contrast, preferences are easier to collect, but it is unclear which parts of a behavior contribute most to a trajectory segment, leaving credit assignment unresolved. In this paper, we introduce a Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) scheme to unify these two feedback sources. For each transition in a preference labeled trajectory, SPW searches for the most similar state-action pairs from expert demonstrations and directly derives stepwise importance weights based on their similarity scores. These weights are then used to guide standard preference learning, enabling more accurate credit assignment that traditional approaches struggle to achieve. We demonstrate that SPW enables effective joint learning from preferences and demonstrations, outperforming prior methods that leverage both feedback types on challenging robot manipulation tasks.

Abstract: We present AniME, a director-oriented multi-agent system for automated long-form anime production, covering the full workflow from a story to the final video. The director agent keeps a global memory for the whole workflow, and coordinates several downstream specialized agents. By integrating customized Model Context Protocol (MCP) with downstream model instruction, the specialized agent adaptively selects control conditions for diverse sub-tasks. AniME produces cinematic animation with consistent characters and synchronized audio visual elements, offering a scalable solution for AI-driven anime creation.

Abstract: The study of emergent behaviors in large language model (LLM)-driven multi-agent systems is a critical research challenge, yet progress is limited by a lack of principled methodologies for controlled experimentation. To address this, we introduce Shachi, a formal methodology and modular framework that decomposes an agent's policy into core cognitive components: Configuration for intrinsic traits, Memory for contextual persistence, and Tools for expanded capabilities, all orchestrated by an LLM reasoning engine. This principled architecture moves beyond brittle, ad-hoc agent designs and enables the systematic analysis of how specific architectural choices influence collective behavior. We validate our methodology on a comprehensive 10-task benchmark and demonstrate its power through novel scientific inquiries. Critically, we establish the external validity of our approach by modeling a real-world U.S. tariff shock, showing that agent behaviors align with observed market reactions only when their cognitive architecture is appropriately configured with memory and tools. Our work provides a rigorous, open-source foundation for building and evaluating LLM agents, aimed at fostering more cumulative and scientifically grounded research.

Abstract: The process of scientific discovery relies on an interplay of observations, analysis, and hypothesis generation. Machine learning is increasingly being adopted to address individual aspects of this process. However, it remains an open challenge to fully automate the heuristic, iterative loop required to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through experiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a given task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large language model tool-use capabilities to enable exploration of systems without any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to physical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution, and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring Hamiltonians from expectation values. The demonstrated effectiveness of this setup opens the door towards similar scientific exploration in other domains, without the need for finetuning or task-specific instructions.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs or LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, but suffer from significant computational inefficiencies due to overthinking phenomena. Existing efficient reasoning methods face the challenge of balancing reasoning quality with inference cost reduction. We propose \textbf{Adaptive Reasoning Suppression (ARS)}, a novel training-free approach that dynamically suppresses redundant reasoning steps while preserving accuracy through adaptive certainty monitoring. ARS introduces a multi-checkpoint certainty estimation mechanism with progressive suppression thresholds, achieving superior efficiency compared to static suppression methods. Our extensive evaluation across mathematical reasoning benchmarks using multiple model architectures demonstrates that ARS achieves up to 53%, 46.1%, and 57.9% in token, latency and energy reduction, while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Abstract: Naturalistic fMRI encoding must handle multimodal inputs, shifting fusion styles, and pronounced inter-subject variability. We introduce AFIRE (Agnostic Framework for Multimodal fMRI Response Encoding), an agnostic interface that standardizes time-aligned post-fusion tokens from varied encoders, and MIND, a plug-and-play Mixture-of-Experts decoder with a subject-aware dynamic gating. Trained end-to-end for whole-brain prediction, AFIRE decouples the decoder from upstream fusion, while MIND combines token-dependent Top-K sparse routing with a subject prior to personalize expert usage without sacrificing generality. Experiments across multiple multimodal backbones and subjects show consistent improvements over strong baselines, enhanced cross-subject generalization, and interpretable expert patterns that correlate with content type. The framework offers a simple attachment point for new encoders and datasets, enabling robust, plug-and-improve performance for naturalistic neuroimaging studies.

<title>Improving Image Captioning Descriptiveness by Ranking and LLM-based Fusion</title>

Abstract: State-of-The-Art (SoTA) image captioning models are often trained on the MicroSoft Common Objects in Context (MS-COCO) dataset, which contains human-annotated captions with an average length of approximately ten tokens. Although effective for general scene understanding, these short captions often fail to capture complex scenes and convey detailed information. Moreover, captioning models tend to exhibit bias towards the ``average'' caption, which captures only the more general aspects, thus overlooking finer details. In this paper, we present a novel approach to generate richer and more informative image captions by combining the captions generated from different SoTA captioning models. Our proposed method requires no additional model training: given an image, it leverages pre-trained models from the literature to generate the initial captions, and then ranks them using a newly introduced image-text-based metric, which we name BLIPScore. Subsequently, the top two captions are fused using a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce the final, more detailed description. Experimental results on the MS-COCO and Flickr30k test sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of caption-image alignment and hallucination reduction according to the ALOHa, CAPTURE, and Polos metrics. A subjective study lends additional support to these results, suggesting that the captions produced by our model are generally perceived as more consistent with human judgment. By combining the strengths of diverse SoTA models, our method enhances the quality and appeal of image captions, bridging the gap between automated systems and the rich and informative nature of human-generated descriptions. This advance enables the generation of more suitable captions for the training of both vision-language and captioning models.

<title>ConjNorm: Tractable Density Estimation for Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>

Abstract: Post-hoc out-of-distribution (OOD) detection has garnered intensive attention in reliable machine learning. Many efforts have been dedicated to deriving score functions based on logits, distances, or rigorous data distribution assumptions to identify low-scoring OOD samples. Nevertheless, these estimate scores may fail to accurately reflect the true data density or impose impractical constraints. To provide a unified perspective on density-based score design, we propose a novel theoretical framework grounded in Bregman divergence, which extends distribution considerations to encompass an exponential family of distributions. Leveraging the conjugation constraint revealed in our theorem, we introduce a \textsc{ConjNorm} method, reframing density function design as a search for the optimal norm coefficient $p$ against the given dataset. In light of the computational challenges of normalization, we devise an unbiased and analytically tractable estimator of the partition function using the Monte Carlo-based importance sampling technique. Extensive experiments across OOD detection benchmarks empirically demonstrate that our proposed \textsc{ConjNorm} has established a new state-of-the-art in a variety of OOD detection setups, outperforming the current best method by up to 13.25$\%$ and 28.19$\%$ (FPR95) on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K, respectively.

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to enable models to continuously learn new classes while overcoming catastrophic forgetting. The introduction of pre-trained models has brought new tuning paradigms to CIL. In this paper, we revisit different parameter-efficient tuning (PET) methods within the context of continual learning. We observe that adapter tuning demonstrates superiority over prompt-based methods, even without parameter expansion in each learning session. Motivated by this, we propose incrementally tuning the shared adapter without imposing parameter update constraints, enhancing the learning capacity of the backbone. Additionally, we employ feature sampling from stored prototypes to retrain a unified classifier, further improving its performance. We estimate the semantic shift of old prototypes without access to past samples and update stored prototypes session by session. Our proposed method eliminates model expansion and avoids retaining any image samples. It surpasses previous pre-trained model-based CIL methods and demonstrates remarkable continual learning capabilities. Experimental results on five CIL benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Abstract: Code LLMs have shown promising results with converting tasks in natural language to programs that can be executed by service robots. We are interested in finetuning small, specialized LLMs for this purpose, but collecting datasets of task-program pairs specific to each robot is time-consuming and expensive. While approaches such as SELF-INSTRUCT and EVOL-INSTRUCT are capable of generating novel tasks given a few examples, they are unable to provide the corresponding programs that correctly abide by physical-world and robot-constraints using the provided programming interface. Using a simulator is a natural potential solution to checking for such constraints, but building simulation environments that can handle arbitrary tasks and their necessary objects and locations, is challenging. To address these challenges, we introduce ROBO-INSTRUCT, which synthesizes task-specific simulation environments on the fly during program execution, by opportunistically inferring entity properties and enforcing corresponding constraints based on how the entities are used in the task program. Additionally, ROBO-INSTRUCT integrates an LLM-aided post-processing procedure to refine instructions for better alignment with robot programs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ROBO-INSTRUCT across multiple LLMs, showing that our fine-tuned models outperform all baseline methods and even match or surpass the performance of several larger and proprietary models.

<title>E-ICL: Enhancing Fine-Grained Emotion Recognition through the Lens of Prototype Theory</title>

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) achieves remarkable performance in various domains such as knowledge acquisition, commonsense reasoning, and semantic understanding. However, its performance significantly deteriorates for emotion detection tasks, especially fine-grained emotion recognition. The underlying reasons for this remain unclear. In this paper, we identify the reasons behind ICL's poor performance from the perspective of prototype theory and propose a method to address this issue. Specifically, we conduct extensive pilot experiments and find that ICL conforms to the prototype theory on fine-grained emotion recognition. Based on this theory, we uncover the following deficiencies in ICL: (1) It relies on prototypes (example-label pairs) that are semantically similar but emotionally inaccurate to predict emotions. (2) It is prone to interference from irrelevant categories, affecting the accuracy and robustness of the predictions. To address these issues, we propose an Emotion Context Learning method (E-ICL) on fine-grained emotion recognition. E-ICL relies on more emotionally accurate prototypes to predict categories by referring to emotionally similar examples with dynamic labels. Simultaneously, E-ICL employs an exclusionary emotion prediction strategy to avoid interference from irrelevant categories, thereby increasing its accuracy and robustness. Note that the entire process is accomplished with the assistance of a plug-and-play emotion auxiliary model, without additional training. Experiments on the fine-grained emotion datasets EDOS, Empathetic-Dialogues, EmpatheticIntent, and GoEmotions show that E-ICL achieves superior emotion prediction performance. Furthermore, even when the emotion auxiliary model used is lower than 10% of the LLMs, E-ICL can still boost the performance of LLMs by over 4% on multiple datasets.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can surpass humans in certain forecasting tasks. What role does this leave for humans in the overall decision process? One possibility is that humans, despite performing worse than LLMs, can still add value when teamed with them. A human and machine team can surpass each individual teammate when team members' confidence is well-calibrated and team members diverge in which tasks they find difficult (i.e., calibration and diversity are needed). We simplified and extended a Bayesian approach to combining judgments using a logistic regression framework that integrates confidence-weighted judgments for any number of team members. Using this straightforward method, we demonstrated its effectiveness in both image classification and neuroscience forecasting tasks. Combining human judgments with one or more machines consistently improved overall team performance. Our hope is that this simple and effective strategy for integrating the judgments of humans and machines will lead to productive collaborations.

Abstract: Echocardiography is an essential medical technique for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases, but its high operational complexity has led to a shortage of trained professionals. To address this issue, we introduce a novel probe movement guidance algorithm that has the potential to be applied in guiding robotic systems or novices with probe pose adjustment for high-quality standard plane image acquisition.Cardiac ultrasound faces two major challenges: (1) the inherently complex structure of the heart, and (2) significant individual variations. Previous works have only learned the population-averaged structure of the heart rather than personalized cardiac structures, leading to a performance bottleneck. Clinically, we observe that sonographers dynamically adjust their interpretation of a patient's cardiac anatomy based on prior scanning sequences, consequently refining their scanning strategies. Inspired by this, we propose a novel sequence-aware self-supervised pre-training method. Specifically, our approach learns personalized three-dimensional cardiac structural features by predicting the masked-out image features and probe movement actions in a scanning sequence. We hypothesize that if the model can predict the missing content it has acquired a good understanding of personalized cardiac structure. Extensive experiments on a large-scale expert scanning dataset with 1.67 million samples demonstrate that our proposed sequence-aware paradigm can effectively reduce probe guidance errors compared to other advanced baseline methods.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning, off-policy actor-critic methods like DDPG and TD3 use deterministic policy gradients: the Q-function is learned from environment data, while the actor maximizes it via gradient ascent. We observe that in complex tasks such as dexterous manipulation and restricted locomotion with mobility constraints, the Q-function exhibits many local optima, making gradient ascent prone to getting stuck. To address this, we introduce SAVO, an actor architecture that (i) generates multiple action proposals and selects the one with the highest Q-value, and (ii) approximates the Q-function repeatedly by truncating poor local optima to guide gradient ascent more effectively. We evaluate tasks such as restricted locomotion, dexterous manipulation, and large discrete-action space recommender systems and show that our actor finds optimal actions more frequently and outperforms alternate actor architectures.

Abstract: Clinical decision making (CDM) is a complex, dynamic process crucial to healthcare delivery, yet it remains a significant challenge for artificial intelligence systems. While Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have been tested on general medical knowledge using licensing exams and knowledge question-answering tasks, their performance in the CDM in real-world scenarios is limited due to the lack of comprehensive testing datasets that mirror actual medical practice. To address this gap, we present MedChain, a dataset of 12,163 clinical cases that covers five key stages of clinical workflow. MedChain distinguishes itself from existing benchmarks with three key features of real-world clinical practice: personalization, interactivity, and sequentiality. Further, to tackle real-world CDM challenges, we also propose MedChain-Agent, an AI system that integrates a feedback mechanism and a MCase-RAG module to learn from previous cases and adapt its responses. MedChain-Agent demonstrates remarkable adaptability in gathering information dynamically and handling sequential clinical tasks, significantly outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-vision generation excel in visual fidelity but struggle with compositional generalization and semantic alignment. Existing datasets are noisy and weakly compositional, limiting models' understanding of complex scenes, while scalable solutions for dense, high-quality annotations remain a challenge. We introduce Generate Any Scene, a data engine that systematically enumerates scene graphs representing the combinatorial array of possible visual scenes. Generate Any Scene dynamically constructs scene graphs of varying complexity from a structured taxonomy of objects, attributes, and relations. Given a sampled scene graph, Generate Any Scene translates it into a caption for text-to-image or text-to-video generation; it also translates it into a set of visual question answers that allow automatic evaluation and reward modeling of semantic alignment. Using Generate Any Scene, we first design a self-improving framework where models iteratively enhance their performance using generated data. Stable Diffusion v1.5 achieves an average 4% improvement over baselines and surpassing fine-tuning on CC3M. Second, we also design a distillation algorithm to transfer specific strengths from proprietary models to their open-source counterparts. Using fewer than 800 synthetic captions, we fine-tune Stable Diffusion v1.5 and achieve a 10% increase in TIFA score on compositional and hard concept generation. Third, we create a reward model to align model generation with semantic accuracy at a low cost. Using GRPO algorithm, we fine-tune SimpleAR-0.5B-SFT and surpass CLIP-based methods by +5% on DPG-Bench. Finally, we apply these ideas to the downstream task of content moderation where we train models to identify challenging cases by learning from synthetic data.

Abstract: Drone swarm performances -- synchronized, expressive aerial displays set to music -- have emerged as a captivating application of modern robotics. Yet designing smooth, safe choreographies remains a complex task requiring expert knowledge. We present SwarmGPT, a language-based choreographer that leverages the reasoning power of large language models (LLMs) to streamline drone performance design. The LLM is augmented by a safety filter that ensures deployability by making minimal corrections when safety or feasibility constraints are violated. By decoupling high-level choreographic design from low-level motion planning, our system enables non-experts to iteratively refine choreographies using natural language without worrying about collisions or actuator limits. We validate our approach through simulations with swarms up to 200 drones and real-world experiments with up to 20 drones performing choreographies to diverse types of songs, demonstrating scalable, synchronized, and safe performances. Beyond entertainment, this work offers a blueprint for integrating foundation models into safety-critical swarm robotics applications.

Abstract: In sequential recommendation, models recommend items based on user's interaction history. To this end, current models usually incorporate information such as item descriptions and user intent or preferences. User preferences are usually not explicitly given in open-source datasets, and thus need to be approximated, for example via large language models (LLMs). Current approaches leverage approximated user preferences only during training and rely solely on the past interaction history for recommendations, limiting their ability to dynamically adapt to changing preferences, potentially reinforcing echo chambers. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm, namely preference discerning, which explicitly conditions a generative recommendation model on user preferences in natural language within its context. To evaluate preference discerning, we introduce a novel benchmark that provides a holistic evaluation across various scenarios, including preference steering and sentiment following. Upon evaluating current state-of-the-art methods on our benchmark, we discover that their ability to dynamically adapt to evolving user preferences is limited. To address this, we propose a new method named Mender ($\textbf{M}$ultimodal Prefer$\textbf{en}$ce $\textbf{D}$iscern$\textbf{er}$), which achieves state-of-the-art performance in our benchmark. Our results show that Mender effectively adapts its recommendation guided by human preferences, even if not observed during training, paving the way toward more flexible recommendation models.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is an important machine learning task with many real-world uses, including fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and industrial monitoring. Within natural language processing (NLP), AD helps detect issues like spam, misinformation, and unusual user activity. Although large language models (LLMs) have had a strong impact on tasks such as text generation and summarization, their potential in AD has not been studied enough. This paper introduces AD-LLM, the first benchmark that evaluates how LLMs can help with NLP anomaly detection. We examine three key tasks: (i) zero-shot detection, using LLMs' pre-trained knowledge to perform AD without tasks-specific training; (ii) data augmentation, generating synthetic data and category descriptions to improve AD models; and (iii) model selection, using LLMs to suggest unsupervised AD models. Through experiments with different datasets, we find that LLMs can work well in zero-shot AD, that carefully designed augmentation methods are useful, and that explaining model selection for specific datasets remains challenging. Based on these results, we outline six future research directions on LLMs for AD.

Abstract: Tree-based Genetic Programming (TGP) is a widely used evolutionary algorithm for tasks such as symbolic regression, classification, and robotic control. Due to the intensive computational demands of running TGP, GPU acceleration is crucial for achieving scalable performance. However, efficient GPU-based execution of TGP remains challenging, primarily due to three core issues: (1) the structural heterogeneity of program individuals, (2) the complexity of integrating multiple levels of parallelism, and (3) the incompatibility between high-performance CUDA execution and flexible Python-based environments. To address these issues, we propose EvoGP, a high-performance framework tailored for GPU acceleration of TGP via population-level parallel execution. First, EvoGP introduces a tensorized representation that encodes variable-sized trees into fixed-shape, memory-aligned arrays, enabling uniform memory access and parallel computation across diverse individuals. Second, EvoGP adopts an adaptive parallelism strategy that dynamically combines intra- and inter-individual parallelism based on dataset size, ensuring high GPU utilization across a broad spectrum of tasks. Third, EvoGP embeds custom CUDA kernels into the PyTorch runtime, achieving seamless integration with Python-based environments such as Gym, MuJoCo, Brax, and Genesis. Experiments show that EvoGP attains a peak throughput exceeding $10^{11}$ GPops/s, with speedups of up to $528\times$ over GPU-based TGP implementations and $18\times$ over the fastest CPU-based libraries, while maintaining comparable accuracy and improved scalability across large population sizes. EvoGP is open source and accessible at: https://github.com/EMI-Group/evogp.

Abstract: Recent developments in Large Language Model (LLM) agents are revolutionizing Autonomous Software Engineering (ASE), enabling automated coding, problem fixes, and feature improvements. However, localization -- precisely identifying software problems by navigating to relevant code sections -- remains a significant challenge. Current approaches often yield suboptimal results due to a lack of effective integration between LLM agents and precise code search mechanisms. This paper introduces OrcaLoca, an LLM agent framework that improves accuracy for software issue localization by integrating priority-based scheduling for LLM-guided action, action decomposition with relevance scoring, and distance-aware context pruning. Experimental results demonstrate that OrcaLoca becomes the new open-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) in function match rate (65.33%) on SWE-bench Lite. It also improves the final resolved rate of an open-source framework by 6.33 percentage points through its patch generation integration.

Abstract: Human-robot cooperative navigation is challenging under incomplete information. We introduce CoNav-Maze, a simulated environment where a robot navigates with local perception while a human operator provides guidance based on an inaccurate map. The robot can share its onboard camera views to help the operator refine their understanding of the environment. To enable efficient cooperation, we propose Information Gain Monte Carlo Tree Search (IG-MCTS), an online planning algorithm that jointly optimizes autonomous movement and informative communication. IG-MCTS leverages a learned Neural Human Perception Model (NHPM) -- trained on a crowdsourced mapping dataset -- to predict how the human's internal map evolves as new observations are shared. User studies show that IG-MCTS significantly reduces communication demands and yields eye-tracking metrics indicative of lower cognitive load, while maintaining task performance comparable to teleoperation and instruction-following baselines. Finally, we illustrate generalization beyond discrete mazes through a continuous-space waterway navigation setting, in which NHPM benefits from deeper encoder-decoder architectures and IG-MCTS leverages a dynamically constructed Voronoi-partitioned traversability graph.

Abstract: The widespread use of chest X-rays (CXRs), coupled with a shortage of radiologists, has driven growing interest in automated CXR analysis and AI-assisted reporting. While existing vision-language models (VLMs) show promise in specific tasks such as report generation or abnormality detection, they often lack support for interactive diagnostic capabilities. In this work we present RadVLM, a compact, multitask conversational foundation model designed for CXR interpretation. To this end, we curate a large-scale instruction dataset comprising over 1 million image-instruction pairs containing both single-turn tasks -- such as report generation, abnormality classification, and visual grounding -- and multi-turn, multi-task conversational interactions. After fine-tuning RadVLM on this instruction dataset, we evaluate it across different tasks along with re-implemented baseline VLMs. Our results show that RadVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in conversational capabilities and visual grounding while remaining competitive in other radiology tasks. Ablation studies further highlight the benefit of joint training across multiple tasks, particularly for scenarios with limited annotated data. Together, these findings highlight the potential of RadVLM as a clinically relevant AI assistant, providing structured CXR interpretation and conversational capabilities to support more effective and accessible diagnostic workflows.

Abstract: A recent line of research has exploited pre-trained generative diffusion models as priors for solving Bayesian inverse problems. We contribute to this research direction by designing a sequential Monte Carlo method for linear-Gaussian inverse problems which builds on "decoupled diffusion", where the generative process is designed such that larger updates to the sample are possible. The method is asymptotically exact and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our Decoupled Diffusion Sequential Monte Carlo (DDSMC) algorithm on both synthetic as well as protein and image data. Further, we demonstrate how the approach can be extended to discrete data.

Abstract: Crystalline materials often exhibit a high level of symmetry. However, most generative models do not account for symmetry, but rather model each atom without any constraints on its position or element. We propose a generative model, Wyckoff Diffusion (WyckoffDiff), which generates symmetry-based descriptions of crystals. This is enabled by considering a crystal structure representation that encodes all symmetry, and we design a novel neural network architecture which enables using this representation inside a discrete generative model framework. In addition to respecting symmetry by construction, the discrete nature of our model enables fast generation. We additionally present a new metric, Fr\'echet Wrenformer Distance, which captures the symmetry aspects of the materials generated, and we benchmark WyckoffDiff against recently proposed generative models for crystal generation. As a proof-of-concept study, we use WyckoffDiff to find new materials below the convex hull of thermodynamical stability.

Abstract: Recommender systems are essential for modern content platforms, yet traditional behavior-based models often struggle with cold users who have limited interaction data. Engaging these users is crucial for platform growth. To bridge this gap, we propose leveraging the social-relation graph to enrich interest representations from behavior-based models. However, extracting value from social graphs is challenging due to relation noise and cross-domain inconsistency. To address the noise propagation and obtain accurate social interest, we employ a dual-view denoising strategy, employing low-rank SVD to the user-item interaction matrix for a denoised social graph and contrastive learning to align the original and reconstructed social graphs. Addressing the interest inconsistency between social and behavioral interests, we adopt a "mutual distillation" technique to isolate the original interests into aligned social/behavior interests and social/behavior specific interests, maximizing the utility of both. Experimental results on widely adopted industry datasets verify the method's effectiveness, particularly for cold users, offering a fresh perspective for future research. The implementation can be accessed at https://github.com/WANGLin0126/CLSRec.

Abstract: When we train models on biased ML datasets, they not only learn these biases but can inflate them at test time - a phenomenon called bias amplification. To measure bias amplification in ML datasets, many co-occurrence-based metrics have been proposed. Co-occurrence-based metrics are effective in measuring bias amplification in simple problems like image classification. However, these metrics are ineffective for complex problems like image captioning as they cannot capture the semantics of a caption. To measure bias amplification in captions, prior work introduced a predictability-based metric called Leakage in Captioning (LIC). While LIC captures the semantics and context of captions, it has limitations. LIC cannot identify the direction in which bias is amplified, poorly estimates dataset bias due to a weak vocabulary substitution strategy, and is highly sensitive to attacker models (a hyperparameter in predictability-based metrics). To overcome these issues, we propose Directional Predictability Amplification in Captioning (DPAC). DPAC measures directional bias amplification in captions, provides a better estimate of dataset bias using an improved substitution strategy, and is less sensitive to attacker models. Our experiments on the COCO captioning dataset show how DPAC is the most reliable metric to measure bias amplification in captions.

Abstract: Imitation Learning offers a promising approach to learn directly from data without requiring explicit models, simulations, or detailed task definitions. During inference, actions are sampled from the learned distribution and executed on the robot. However, sampled actions may fail for various reasons, and simply repeating the sampling step until a successful action is obtained can be inefficient. In this work, we propose an enhanced sampling strategy that refines the sampling distribution to avoid previously unsuccessful actions. We demonstrate that by solely utilizing data from successful demonstrations, our method can infer recovery actions without the need for additional exploratory behavior or a high-level controller. Furthermore, we leverage the concept of diffusion model decomposition to break down the primary problem, which may require long-horizon history to manage failures, into multiple smaller, more manageable sub-problems in learning, data collection, and inference, thereby enabling the system to adapt to variable failure counts. Our approach yields a low-level controller that dynamically adjusts its sampling space to improve efficiency when prior samples fall short. We validate our method across several tasks, including door opening with unknown directions, object manipulation, and button-searching scenarios, demonstrating that our approach outperforms traditional baselines.

<title>Issue Localization via LLM-Driven Iterative Code Graph Searching</title>

Abstract: Issue solving aims to generate patches to fix reported issues in real-world code repositories according to issue descriptions. Issue localization forms the basis for accurate issue solving. Recently, LLM-based issue localization methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, these methods either search from files mentioned in issue descriptions or in the whole repository and struggle to balance the breadth and depth of the search space to converge on the target efficiently. Moreover, they allow LLM to explore whole repositories freely, making it challenging to control the search direction to prevent the LLM from searching for incorrect targets. This paper introduces CoSIL, an LLM-driven, powerful function-level issue localization method without training or indexing. CoSIL employs a two-phase code graph search strategy. It first conducts broad exploration at the file level using dynamically constructed module call graphs, and then performs in-depth analysis at the function level by expanding the module call graph into a function call graph and executing iterative searches. To precisely control the search direction, CoSIL designs a pruner to filter unrelated directions and irrelevant contexts. To avoid incorrect interaction formats in long contexts, CoSIL introduces a reflection mechanism that uses additional independent queries in short contexts to enhance formatted abilities. Experiment results demonstrate that CoSIL achieves a Top-1 localization accuracy of 43.3\% and 44.6\% on SWE-bench Lite and SWE-bench Verified, respectively, with Qwen2.5-Coder-32B, average outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by 96.04\%. When CoSIL is integrated into an issue-solving method, Agentless, the issue resolution rate improves by 2.98\%--30.5\%.

Abstract: Decoding sensory experiences from neural activity to reconstruct human-perceived visual stimuli and semantic content remains a challenge in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Despite notable progress in current brain decoding models, a critical gap still persists in their systematic integration with established neuroscientific theories and the exploration of underlying neural mechanisms. Here, we present a novel framework that directly decodes fMRI signals into textual descriptions of viewed natural images. Our novel deep learning model, trained without visual information, achieves state-of-the-art semantic decoding performance, generating meaningful captions that capture the core semantic content of complex scenes. Neuroanatomical analysis reveals the critical role of higher-level visual cortices, including MT+ complex, ventral stream visual cortex, and inferior parietal cortex, in visual semantic processing. Furthermore, category-specific analysis demonstrates nuanced neural representations for semantic dimensions like animacy and motion. This work provides a more direct and interpretable framework to the brain's semantic decoding, offering a powerful new methodology for probing the neural basis of complex semantic processing, refining the understanding of the distributed semantic network, and potentially developing brain-sinpired language models.

<title>DeepOHeat-v1: Efficient Operator Learning for Fast and Trustworthy Thermal Simulation and Optimization in 3D-IC Design</title>

Abstract: Thermal analysis is crucial in 3D-IC design due to increased power density and complex heat dissipation paths. Although operator learning frameworks such as DeepOHeat~\cite{liu2023deepoheat} have demonstrated promising preliminary results in accelerating thermal simulation, they face critical limitations in prediction capability for multi-scale thermal patterns, training efficiency, and trustworthiness of results during design optimization. This paper presents DeepOHeat-v1, an enhanced physics-informed operator learning framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations. First, we integrate Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with learnable activation functions as trunk networks, enabling an adaptive representation of multi-scale thermal patterns. This approach achieves a 1.25x and 6.29x reduction in error in two representative test cases. Second, we introduce a separable training method that decomposes the basis function along the coordinate axes, achieving 62x training speedup and 31x GPU memory reduction in our baseline case, and enabling thermal analysis at resolutions previously infeasible due to GPU memory constraints. Third, we propose a confidence score to evaluate the trustworthiness of the predicted results, and further develop a hybrid optimization workflow that combines operator learning with finite difference (FD) using Generalized Minimal Residual (GMRES) method for incremental solution refinement, enabling efficient and trustworthy thermal optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepOHeat-v1 achieves accuracy comparable to optimization using high-fidelity finite difference solvers, while speeding up the entire optimization process by $70.6\times$ in our test cases, effectively minimizing the peak temperature through optimal placement of heat-generating components. Open source code is available at https://github.com/xlyu0127/DeepOHeat-v1.

Abstract: This paper introduces Timestep-Adaptive Representation Alignment with Onset-Aware Conditioning (TARO), a novel framework for high-fidelity and temporally coherent video-to-audio synthesis. Built upon flow-based transformers, which offer stable training and continuous transformations for enhanced synchronization and audio quality, TARO introduces two key innovations: (1) Timestep-Adaptive Representation Alignment (TRA), which dynamically aligns latent representations by adjusting alignment strength based on the noise schedule, ensuring smooth evolution and improved fidelity, and (2) Onset-Aware Conditioning (OAC), which integrates onset cues that serve as sharp event-driven markers of audio-relevant visual moments to enhance synchronization with dynamic visual events. Extensive experiments on the VGGSound and Landscape datasets demonstrate that TARO outperforms prior methods, achieving relatively 53% lower Frechet Distance (FD), 29% lower Frechet Audio Distance (FAD), and a 97.19% Alignment Accuracy, highlighting its superior audio quality and synchronization precision.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), have opened new opportunities for enhancing recommender systems (RecSys). Most existing LLM-based RecSys approaches operate in a discrete space, using vector-quantized tokenizers to align with the inherent discrete nature of language models. However, these quantization methods often result in lossy tokenization and suboptimal learning, primarily due to inaccurate gradient propagation caused by the non-differentiable argmin operation in standard vector quantization. Inspired by the emerging trend of embracing continuous tokens in language models, we propose ContRec, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates continuous tokens into LLM-based RecSys. Specifically, ContRec consists of two key modules: a sigma-VAE Tokenizer, which encodes users/items with continuous tokens; and a Dispersive Diffusion module, which captures implicit user preference. The tokenizer is trained with a continuous Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) objective, where three effective techniques are adopted to avoid representation collapse. By conditioning on the previously generated tokens of the LLM backbone during user modeling, the Dispersive Diffusion module performs a conditional diffusion process with a novel Dispersive Loss, enabling high-quality user preference generation through next-token diffusion. Finally, ContRec leverages both the textual reasoning output from the LLM and the latent representations produced by the diffusion model for Top-K item retrieval, thereby delivering comprehensive recommendation results. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that \ourname{} consistently outperforms both traditional and SOTA LLM-based recommender systems. Our results highlight the potential of continuous tokenization and generative modeling for advancing the next generation of recommender systems.

Abstract: AI code generation tools have gained significant popularity among developers, who use them to assist in software development due to their capability to generate code. Existing studies mainly explored the quality, e.g., correctness and security, of AI-generated code, while in real-world software development, the prerequisite is to distinguish AI-generated code from human-written code, which emphasizes the need to explicitly declare AI-generated code by developers. To this end, this study intends to understand the ways developers use to self-declare AI-generated code and explore the reasons why developers choose to self-declare or not. We conducted a mixed-methods study consisting of two phases. In the first phase, we mined GitHub repositories and collected 613 instances of AI-generated code snippets. In the second phase, we conducted a follow-up practitioners' survey, which received 111 valid responses. Our research revealed the practices followed by developers to self-declare AI-generated code. Most practitioners (76.6%) always or sometimes self-declare AI-generated code. In contrast, other practitioners (23.4%) noted that they never self-declare AI-generated code. The reasons for self-declaring AI-generated code include the need to track and monitor the code for future review and debugging, and ethical considerations. The reasons for not self-declaring AI-generated code include extensive modifications to AI-generated code and the developers' perception that self-declaration is an unnecessary activity. We finally provided guidelines for practitioners to self-declare AI-generated code, addressing ethical and code quality concerns.

Abstract: There has been extensive prior work exploring how psychological factors such as anthropomorphism affect the adoption of Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs). However, limited research has been conducted on how prompt strategies in large language models (LLM)-powered conversational SAV agents affect users' perceptions, experiences, and intentions to adopt such technology. In this work, we investigate how conversational SAV agents powered by LLMs drive these psychological factors, such as psychological ownership, the sense of possession a user may come to feel towards an entity or object they may not legally own. We designed four SAV agents with varying levels of anthropomorphic characteristics and psychological ownership triggers. Quantitative measures of psychological ownership, anthropomorphism, quality of service, disclosure tendency, sentiment of SAV responses, and overall acceptance were collected after participants interacted with each SAV. Qualitative feedback was also gathered regarding the experience of psychological ownership during the interactions. The results indicate that an SAV designed to be more anthropomorphic and to induce psychological ownership improved users' perceptions of the SAV's human-like qualities, and its responses were perceived as more positive but also more subjective compared to the control conditions. Qualitative findings support established routes to psychological ownership in the SAV context and suggest that the conversational agent's perceived performance may also influence psychological ownership. Both quantitative and qualitative outcomes highlight the importance of personalization in designing effective SAV interactions. These findings provide practical guidance for designing conversational SAV agents that enhance user experience and adoption.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically extract visual features from the final layers of a pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT). This widespread deep-layer bias, however, is largely driven by empirical convention rather than principled analysis. While prior studies suggest that different ViT layers capture different types of information, with shallower layers focusing on fine visual details and deeper layers aligning more closely with textual semantics, the impact of this variation on MLLM performance remains underexplored. We present the first comprehensive study of visual layer selection for MLLMs, analyzing representation similarity across ViT layers to establish shallow, middle, and deep layer groupings. Through extensive evaluation of MLLMs (1.4B-7B parameters) across 10 benchmarks encompassing 60+ tasks, we find that while deep layers excel in semantic-rich tasks like OCR, shallow and middle layers significantly outperform them on fine-grained visual tasks including counting, positioning, and object localization. Building on these insights, we propose a lightweight feature fusion method that strategically incorporates shallower layers, achieving consistent improvements over both single-layer and specialized fusion baselines. Our work offers the first principled study of visual layer selection in MLLMs, showing that MLLMs can often see better when they look shallower.

Abstract: Human-AI scientific collaboration has evolved from tool-user relationships into co-evolutionary partnerships. When AlphaFold improved protein structure prediction, researchers engaged with an epistemic partner that transformed their approach to structure-function problems. Yet existing frameworks position AI as either sophisticated tool or potential risk, overlooking how scientific understanding emerges through recursive interaction. We introduce Cognitio Emergens (CE), a framework that captures the co-evolutionary nature of human-AI epistemic partnerships.
  Drawing from autopoiesis theory, social systems theory, and organizational modularity, CE integrates three components: Agency Configurations modeling how authority distributes through Directed, Contributory, and Partnership modes, with partnerships oscillating dynamically rather than following linear progression; Epistemic Dimensions capturing six capabilities along Discovery, Integration, and Projection axes, creating distinctive "capability signatures" that guide strategic development; and Partnership Dynamics identifying evolutionary forces including epistemic alienation, where researchers lose interpretive control over knowledge they formally endorse.
  The framework equips researchers to diagnose dimensional imbalances, institutional leaders to design governance structures supporting multiple agency configurations, and policymakers to develop evaluations beyond simple performance metrics. By reconceptualizing human-AI collaboration as fundamentally co-evolutionary, CE provides conceptual tools for cultivating partnerships that preserve epistemic integrity while enabling transformative breakthroughs neither humans nor AI could achieve independently.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, with optimizing their input prompts playing a pivotal role in maximizing their performance. However, while LLM prompts consist of both the task-agnostic system prompts and task-specific user prompts, existing work on prompt optimization has focused on user prompts specific to individual queries or tasks, and largely overlooked the system prompt that is, once optimized, applicable across different tasks and domains. Motivated by this, we introduce the novel problem of bilevel system prompt optimization, whose objective is to design system prompts that are robust to diverse user prompts and transferable to unseen tasks. To tackle this problem, we then propose a meta-learning framework, which meta-learns the system prompt by optimizing it over various user prompts across multiple datasets, while simultaneously updating the user prompts in an iterative manner to ensure synergy between them. We conduct experiments on 14 unseen datasets spanning 5 different domains, on which we show that our approach produces system prompts that generalize effectively to diverse user prompts. Also, our findings reveal that the optimized system prompt enables rapid adaptation even to unseen tasks, requiring fewer optimization steps for test-time user prompts while achieving improved performance.

Abstract: Large language models have recently made great strides in reasoning task performance through chain-of-thought (CoT) strategies trained via reinforcement learning; however, these "reasoning large language models" (RLLMs) remain imperfect reasoners, and understanding the frequencies and causes of their failure modes is important for both users and developers. We test o1-mini, o3-mini, DeepSeek-R1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview, and Grok 3 Mini Beta on graph coloring as a variable-complexity constraint-satisfaction logic problem, and find evidence from both error rate comparisons and CoT/explanation text analysis that RLLMs are prone to hallucinate graph edges not specified in the prompt. This phenomenon persists across multiple problem complexity levels and semantic frames, and it appears to account for a significant fraction of the incorrect answers from every tested model, and the vast majority of them for some models. We also validate the generalizability of this input-conflicting hallucination phenomenon with smaller-scale experiments on a type of stable matching problem. Our results indicate that RLLMs may possess broader issues with misrepresentation of problem specifics, and we offer suggestions for design choices to mitigate this weakness.

Abstract: This paper pioneers a novel data-centric paradigm to maximize the utility of unlabeled data, tackling a critical question: How can we enhance the efficiency and sustainability of deep learning training by optimizing the data itself? We begin by identifying three key limitations in existing model-centric approaches, all rooted in a shared bottleneck: knowledge extracted from data is locked to model parameters, hindering its reusability and scalability. To this end, we propose CoOpt, a highly efficient, parallelized framework for collaborative unlabeled data optimization, thereby effectively encoding knowledge into the data itself. By distributing unlabeled data and leveraging publicly available task-agnostic models, CoOpt facilitates scalable, reusable, and sustainable training pipelines. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate its efficacy and efficiency, achieving 13.6% and 6.8% improvements on Tiny-ImageNet and ImageNet-1K, respectively, with training speedups of $1.94 \times $ and $1.2 \times$.

<title>Game of Trust: How Trustworthy Does Your Blockchain Think You Are?</title>

Abstract: We investigate how a blockchain can distill the collective belief of its nodes regarding the trustworthiness of a (sub)set of nodes into a {\em reputation system} that reflects the probability of correctly performing a task. To address this question, we introduce a framework that breaks it down into two sub-problems:
  1. (Information Extraction): How can the system distill trust information from a function of the nodes' true beliefs?
  2. (Incentive Design): How can we incentivize nodes to truthfully report such information?
  To tackle the first sub-problem, we adapt, in a non-trivial manner, the well-known PageRank algorithm to our problem. For the second, we define a new class of games, called Trustworthy Reputation games (TRep games), which aim to extract the collective beliefs on trust from the actions of rational participants. We then propose a concrete TRep game whose utility function leverages Personalized PageRank and can be instantiated through a straightforward blockchain rewards mechanism. Building on this, we show how the TRep game enables the design of a reputation system. Such systems can enhance the robustness, scalability, and efficiency of blockchain and DeFi solutions. For instance, we demonstrate how such a system can be used within a Proof-of-Reputation blockchain.

<title>Sequential Monte Carlo for Policy Optimization in Continuous POMDPs</title>

Abstract: Optimal decision-making under partial observability requires agents to balance reducing uncertainty (exploration) against pursuing immediate objectives (exploitation). In this paper, we introduce a novel policy optimization framework for continuous partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that explicitly addresses this challenge. Our method casts policy learning as probabilistic inference in a non-Markovian Feynman--Kac model that inherently captures the value of information gathering by anticipating future observations, without requiring suboptimal approximations or handcrafted heuristics. To optimize policies under this model, we develop a nested sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm that efficiently estimates a history-dependent policy gradient under samples from the optimal trajectory distribution induced by the POMDP. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm across standard continuous POMDP benchmarks, where existing methods struggle to act under uncertainty.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong generalization and reasoning abilities, making them well-suited for complex decision-making tasks such as medical consultation (MC). However, existing LLM-based methods often fail to capture the dual nature of MC, which entails two distinct sub-tasks: symptom inquiry, a sequential decision-making process, and disease diagnosis, a classification problem. This mismatch often results in ineffective symptom inquiry and unreliable disease diagnosis. To address this, we propose \textbf{DDO}, a novel LLM-based framework that performs \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{D}ecision \textbf{O}ptimization by decoupling the two sub-tasks and optimizing them with distinct objectives through a collaborative multi-agent workflow. Experiments on three real-world MC datasets show that DDO consistently outperforms existing LLM-based approaches and achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art generation-based methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in the MC task. The code is available at https://github.com/zh-jia/DDO.

<title>Beyond Demonstrations: Dynamic Vector Construction from Latent Representations</title>

Abstract: In-Context derived Vector (ICV) methods extract task-relevant representations from large language models (LLMs) and reinject them during inference, achieving comparable performance to few-shot In-Context Learning (ICL) without repeated demonstration processing. However, existing ICV methods remain sensitive to ICL-specific factors, often use coarse or semantically fragmented representations as the source of the vector, and rely on heuristic-based injection positions, limiting their applicability.
  To address these issues, we propose Dynamic Vector (DyVec), which incorporates an Exhaustive Query Rotation (EQR) strategy to extract robust semantically aggregated latent representations by mitigating variance introduced by ICL. It then applies Dynamic Latent Segmentation and Injection to adaptively partition representations based on task complexity and leverages REINFORCE-based optimization to learn optimal injection positions for each segment.
  Experiments results show that DyVec outperforms few-shot ICL, LoRA, and prior ICV baselines. Further analysis highlights the effectiveness of dynamically segmenting and injecting semantically aggregated latent representations. DyVec provides a lightweight and data-efficient solution for inference-time task adaptation.

<title>FinTagging: Benchmarking LLMs for Extracting and Structuring Financial Information</title>

Abstract: Accurately understanding numbers from financial reports is fundamental to how markets, regulators, algorithms, and normal people read the economy and the world, yet even with XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) designed to tag every figure with standardized accounting concepts, mapping thousands of facts to over 10,000 U.S. GAAP concepts remains costly, inconsistent, and error-prone. Existing benchmarks define tagging as flat, single-step, extreme classification over small subsets of US-GAAP concepts, overlooking both the taxonomy's hierarchical semantics and the structured nature of real tagging, where each fact must be represented as a contextualized multi-field output. These simplifications prevent fair evaluation of large language models (LLMs) under realistic reporting conditions. To address these gaps, we introduce FinTagging, the first comprehensive benchmark for structure-aware and full-scope XBRL tagging, designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to extract and align financial facts through numerical reasoning and taxonomy alignment across text and tables. We define two subtasks: FinNI for numeric identification, which extracts numerical entities and their types from XBRL reports, and FinCL for concept linking, which maps each extracted entity to the corresponding concept in the full US-GAAP taxonomy. Together, these subtasks produce a structured representation of each financial fact. We evaluate diverse LLMs under zero-shot settings and analyze their performance across both subtasks and overall tagging accuracy. Results show that LLMs generalize well in numeric identification but struggle with fine-grained concept linking, revealing current limitations in structure-aware reasoning for accurate financial disclosure. All code and datasets are available on GitHub and Hugging Face.

<title>An LLM-as-Judge Metric for Bridging the Gap with Human Evaluation in SE Tasks</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and other automated techniques have been increasingly used to support software developers by generating software artifacts such as code snippets, patches, and comments. However, accurately assessing the correctness of these generated artifacts remains a significant challenge. On one hand, human evaluation provides high accuracy but is labor-intensive and lacks scalability. On the other hand, many automatic evaluation metrics are scalable and require minimal human effort, but they often fail to accurately reflect the actual correctness of generated software artifacts.
  In this paper, we present SE-Jury, the first evaluation metric for LLM-as-Ensemble-Judge specifically designed to accurately assess the correctness of generated software artifacts. SE-Jury first defines five distinct evaluation strategies, each implemented by an independent judge. A dynamic team selection mechanism then identifies the most appropriate subset of judges as a team to produce a final correctness score through ensembling. We evaluate SE-Jury across a diverse set of software engineering (SE) benchmarks that span three popular SE tasks: code generation, automated program repair, and code summarization. Results demonstrate that SE-Jury consistently achieves a higher correlation with human judgments, with improvements ranging from 29.6% to 140.8% over existing automatic metrics. SE-Jury reaches agreement levels with human annotators that are close to inter-annotator agreement in code generation and program repair. These findings underscore SE-Jury's potential as a scalable and reliable alternative to human evaluation in these SE tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful tools for camera simulation, enabling both geometric transformations and realistic optical effects. Among these, image-based bokeh rendering has shown promising results, but diffusion for video bokeh remains unexplored. Existing image-based methods are plagued by temporal flickering and inconsistent blur transitions, while current video editing methods lack explicit control over the focus plane and bokeh intensity. These issues limit their applicability for controllable video bokeh. In this work, we propose a one-step diffusion framework for generating temporally coherent, depth-aware video bokeh rendering. The framework employs a multi-plane image (MPI) representation adapted to the focal plane to condition the video diffusion model, thereby enabling it to exploit strong 3D priors from pretrained backbones. To further enhance temporal stability, depth robustness, and detail preservation, we introduce a progressive training strategy. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate superior temporal coherence, spatial accuracy, and controllability, outperforming prior baselines. This work represents the first dedicated diffusion framework for video bokeh generation, establishing a new baseline for temporally coherent and controllable depth-of-field effects.

Abstract: Effective clinical decision-making depends on iterative, multimodal reasoning across diverse sources of evidence. The recent emergence of multimodal reasoning models has significantly transformed the landscape of solving complex tasks. Although such models have achieved notable success in mathematics and science, their application to medical domains remains underexplored. In this work, we propose \textit{MedE$^2$}, a two-stage post-training pipeline that elicits and then enhances multimodal reasoning for medical domains. In Stage-I, we fine-tune models using 2,000 text-only data samples containing precisely orchestrated reasoning demonstrations to elicit reasoning behaviors. In Stage-II, we further enhance the model's reasoning capabilities using 1,500 rigorously curated multimodal medical cases, aligning model reasoning outputs with our proposed multimodal medical reasoning preference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of \textit{MedE$^2$} in improving the reasoning performance of medical multimodal models. Notably, models trained with \textit{MedE$^2$} consistently outperform baselines across multiple medical multimodal benchmarks. Additional validation on larger models and under inference-time scaling further confirms the robustness and practical utility of our approach.

Abstract: Adversarial input attacks can cause a significant shift of CLIP embeddings. This can affect the downstream robustness of models incorporating CLIP in the pipeline, such as text-to-image generative models or large vision language models. While some efforts have been done towards making the CLIP image encoders robust, the robustness of text encoders remains unexplored. In this work, we cover this gap in the literature. We propose LEAF: an efficient adversarial finetuning method for the text domain, with the ability to scale to large CLIP models. Our models significantly improve the zero-shot adversarial accuracy in the text domain, while maintaining the vision performance provided by robust image encoders. When combined with text-to-image diffusion models, we can improve the generation quality under adversarial noise. In multimodal retrieval tasks, LEAF improves the recall under adversarial noise over standard CLIP models. Finally, we show that robust text encoders facilitate better reconstruction of input text from its embedding via direct optimization. We open-source our code ( https://github.com/LIONS-EPFL/LEAF ) and models ( https://huggingface.co/LEAF-CLIP ).

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enhance perception and decision-making has become increasingly common. However, the real-time application of VLMs is hindered by high latency and computational overhead, limiting their effectiveness in time-critical driving scenarios. This challenge is particularly evident when VLMs exhibit over-inference, continuing to process unnecessary layers even after confident predictions have been reached. To address this inefficiency, we propose AD-EE, an Early Exit framework that incorporates domain characteristics of autonomous driving and leverages causal inference to identify optimal exit layers. We evaluate our method on large-scale real-world autonomous driving datasets, including Waymo and the corner-case-focused CODA, as well as on a real vehicle running the Autoware Universe platform. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs show that our method significantly reduces latency, with maximum improvements reaching up to 57.58%, and enhances object detection accuracy, with maximum gains of up to 44%.

arXiv:2506.07180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As video large language models (Video-LLMs) become increasingly integrated into real-world applications that demand grounded multimodal reasoning, ensuring their factual consistency and reliability is of critical importance. However, sycophancy, the tendency of these models to align with user input even when it contradicts the visual evidence, undermines their trustworthiness in such contexts. Current sycophancy research has largely overlooked its specific manifestations in the video-language domain, resulting in a notable absence of systematic benchmarks and targeted evaluations to understand how Video-LLMs respond under misleading user input. To fill this gap, we propose VISE (Video-LLM Sycophancy Benchmarking and Evaluation), the first benchmark designed to evaluate sycophantic behavior in state-of-the-art Video-LLMs across diverse question formats, prompt biases, and visual reasoning tasks. Specifically, VISE pioneeringly brings linguistic perspectives on sycophancy into the video domain, enabling fine-grained analysis across multiple sycophancy types and interaction patterns. Furthermore, we propose two potential training-free mitigation strategies, revealing potential paths for reducing sycophantic bias: (i) enhancing visual grounding through interpretable key-frame selection and (ii) steering model behavior away from sycophancy via targeted, inference-time intervention on its internal neural representations. Our code is available at https://github.com/William030422/Video-Sycophancy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in various language tasks, especially with their emergent in-context learning capability. Extending LLMs to incorporate visual inputs, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown impressive performance in tasks such as recognition and visual question answering (VQA). Despite increasing interest in the utility of LLMs in causal reasoning tasks such as causal discovery and counterfactual reasoning, there has been relatively little work showcasing the abilities of LVLMs on visual causal reasoning tasks. We take this opportunity to formally introduce a comprehensive causal reasoning benchmark for multi-modal in-context learning from LVLMs. Our CausalVLBench encompasses three representative tasks: causal structure inference, intervention target prediction, and counterfactual prediction. We evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs on our causal reasoning tasks across three causal representation learning datasets and demonstrate their fundamental strengths and weaknesses. We hope that our benchmark elucidates the drawbacks of existing vision-language models and motivates new directions and paradigms in improving the visual causal reasoning abilities of LVLMs.

Abstract: Modern deep learning models are highly overparameterized, resulting in large sets of parameter configurations that yield the same outputs. A significant portion of this redundancy is explained by symmetries in the parameter space--transformations that leave the network function unchanged. These symmetries shape the loss landscape and constrain learning dynamics, offering a new lens for understanding optimization, generalization, and model complexity that complements existing theory of deep learning. This survey provides an overview of parameter space symmetry. We summarize existing literature, uncover connections between symmetry and learning theory, and identify gaps and opportunities in this emerging field.

arXiv:2506.14020v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph generation has emerged as a critical task in fields ranging from drug discovery to circuit design. Contemporary approaches, notably diffusion and flow-based models, have achieved solid graph generative performance through constructing a probability path that interpolates between reference and data distributions. However, these methods typically model the evolution of individual nodes and edges independently and use linear interpolations to build the path. This disentangled interpolation breaks the interconnected patterns of graphs, making the constructed probability path irregular and non-smooth, which causes poor training dynamics and faulty sampling convergence. To address the limitation, this paper first presents a theoretically grounded framework for probability path construction in graph generative models. Specifically, we model the joint evolution of the nodes and edges by representing graphs as connected systems parameterized by Markov random fields (MRF). We then leverage the optimal transport displacement between MRF objects to design a smooth probability path that ensures the co-evolution of graph components. Based on this, we introduce BWFlow, a flow-matching framework for graph generation that utilizes the derived optimal probability path to benefit the training and sampling algorithm design. Experimental evaluations in plain graph generation and molecule generation validate the effectiveness of BWFlow with competitive performance, better training convergence, and efficient sampling.

<title>Interpretable and Granular Video-Based Quantification of Motor Characteristics from the Finger Tapping Test in Parkinson Disease</title>

arXiv:2506.18925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately quantifying motor characteristics in Parkinson disease (PD) is crucial for monitoring disease progression and optimizing treatment strategies. The finger-tapping test is a standard motor assessment. Clinicians visually evaluate a patient's tapping performance and assign an overall severity score based on tapping amplitude, speed, and irregularity. However, this subjective evaluation is prone to inter- and intra-rater variability, and does not offer insights into individual motor characteristics captured during this test. This paper introduces a granular computer vision-based method for quantifying PD motor characteristics from video recordings. Four sets of clinically relevant features are proposed to characterize hypokinesia, bradykinesia, sequence effect, and hesitation-halts. We evaluate our approach on video recordings and clinical evaluations of 74 PD patients from the Personalized Parkinson Project. Principal component analysis with varimax rotation shows that the video-based features corresponded to the four deficits. Additionally, video-based analysis has allowed us to identify further granular distinctions within sequence effect and hesitation-halts deficits. In the following, we have used these features to train machine learning classifiers to estimate the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) finger-tapping score. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves a higher accuracy in MDS-UPDRS score prediction, while still providing an interpretable quantification of individual finger-tapping motor characteristics. In summary, the proposed framework provides a practical solution for the objective assessment of PD motor characteristics, that can potentially be applied in both clinical and remote settings. Future work is needed to assess its responsiveness to symptomatic treatment and disease progression.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses with inherent biases, undermining their reliability in real-world applications. Existing evaluation methods often overlook biases in long-form responses and the intrinsic variability of LLM outputs. To address these challenges, we propose FiSCo (Fine-grained Semantic Comparison), a novel statistical framework to evaluate group-level fairness in LLMs by detecting subtle semantic differences in long-form responses across demographic groups. Unlike prior work focusing on sentiment or token-level comparisons, FiSCo goes beyond surface-level analysis by operating at the claim level, leveraging entailment checks to assess the consistency of meaning across responses. We decompose model outputs into semantically distinct claims and apply statistical hypothesis testing to compare inter- and intra-group similarities, enabling robust detection of subtle biases. We formalize a new group counterfactual fairness definition and validate FiSCo on both synthetic and human-annotated datasets spanning gender, race, and age. Experiments show that FiSCo more reliably identifies nuanced biases while reducing the impact of stochastic LLM variability, outperforming various evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in large-scale urban environments requires embodied agents to ground linguistic instructions in complex scenes and recall relevant experiences over extended time horizons. Prior modular pipelines offer interpretability but lack unified memory, while end-to-end (M)LLM agents excel at fusing vision and language yet remain constrained by fixed context windows and implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce \textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system that can augment any VLN backbone. Mem4Nav fuses a sparse octree for fine-grained voxel indexing with a semantic topology graph for high-level landmark connectivity, storing both in trainable memory tokens embedded via a reversible Transformer. Long-term memory (LTM) compresses and retains historical observations at both octree and graph nodes, while short-term memory (STM) caches recent multimodal entries in relative coordinates for real-time obstacle avoidance and local planning. At each step, STM retrieval sharply prunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are decoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and Map2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based LLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13 pp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW improvement. Ablations confirm the indispensability of both the hierarchical map and dual memory modules. Our codes are open-sourced via https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/Mem4Nav.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a lightweight variant of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), improves efficiency but suffers from limited exploration and training instability, limiting its effectiveness on complex reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce EFRame, an Exploration-Filter-Replay framework that augments GRPO across three dimensions: additional rollouts enable deeper and more targeted exploration, online filtering removes low-quality samples to stabilize gradients and accelerate training, and experience replay amplifies rare yet informative trajectories for stable convergence. This unified framework establishes a principled training cycle that balances exploration, efficiency, and stability. Experiments on diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that EFRame achieves consistent gains, including a 37.9\% relative improvement on Geometry3K over GRPO. EFRame further supports fine-grained sample categorization and precise entropy control, highlighting it as a robust solution for advancing deeper reasoning in LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/597358816/EFRame.

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization is the workhorse of deep learning, offering efficient and scalable training via backpropagation. However, exposing gradients during training can leak sensitive information about the underlying data, raising privacy and security concerns such as susceptibility to data poisoning attacks. In contrast, black box optimization methods, which treat the model as an opaque function, relying solely on function evaluations to guide optimization, offer a promising alternative in scenarios where data access is restricted, adversarial risks are high, or overfitting is a concern. This paper introduces BBoxER, an evolutionary black-box method for LLM post-training that induces an information bottleneck via implicit compression of the training data. Leveraging the tractability of information flow, we provide non-vacuous generalization bounds and strong theoretical guarantees for differential privacy, robustness to data poisoning attacks, and extraction attacks. In experiments with LLMs, we demonstrate empirically that black-box optimization methods-despite the scalability and computational challenges inherent to black-box approaches-are able to learn, showing how a few iterations of BBoxER improve performance, generalize well on a benchmark of reasoning datasets, and are robust to membership inference attacks. This positions BBoxER as an attractive add-on on top of gradient-based optimization, offering suitability for deployment in restricted or privacy-sensitive environments while also providing non-vacuous generalization guarantees.

Abstract: How to enable agents to predict the outcomes of their own motion intentions in three-dimensional space has been a fundamental problem in embodied intelligence. To explore general spatial imagination capability, we present AirScape, the first world model designed for six-degree-of-freedom aerial agents. AirScape predicts future observation sequences based on current visual inputs and motion intentions. Specifically, we construct a dataset for aerial world model training and testing, which consists of 11k video-intention pairs. This dataset includes first-person-view videos capturing diverse drone actions across a wide range of scenarios, with over 1,000 hours spent annotating the corresponding motion intentions. Then we develop a two-phase schedule to train a foundation model--initially devoid of embodied spatial knowledge--into a world model that is controllable by motion intentions and adheres to physical spatio-temporal constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that AirScape significantly outperforms existing foundation models in 3D spatial imagination capabilities, especially with over a 50% improvement in metrics reflecting motion alignment.

<title>Site-Level Fine-Tuning with Progressive Layer Freezing: Towards Robust Prediction of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia from Day-1 Chest Radiographs in Extremely Preterm Infants</title>

Abstract: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease affecting 35% of extremely low birth weight infants. Defined by oxygen dependence at 36 weeks postmenstrual age, it causes lifelong respiratory complications. However, preventive interventions carry severe risks, including neurodevelopmental impairment, ventilator-induced lung injury, and systemic complications. Therefore, early BPD prognosis and prediction of BPD outcome is crucial to avoid unnecessary toxicity in low risk infants. Admission radiographs of extremely preterm infants are routinely acquired within 24h of life and could serve as a non-invasive prognostic tool. In this work, we developed and investigated a deep learning approach using chest X-rays from 163 extremely low-birth-weight infants ($\leq$32 weeks gestation, 401-999g) obtained within 24 hours of birth. We fine-tuned a ResNet-50 pretrained specifically on adult chest radiographs, employing progressive layer freezing with discriminative learning rates to prevent overfitting and evaluated a CutMix augmentation and linear probing. For moderate/severe BPD outcome prediction, our best performing model with progressive freezing, linear probing and CutMix achieved an AUROC of 0.78 $\pm$ 0.10, balanced accuracy of 0.69 $\pm$ 0.10, and an F1-score of 0.67 $\pm$ 0.11. In-domain pre-training significantly outperformed ImageNet initialization (p = 0.031) which confirms domain-specific pretraining to be important for BPD outcome prediction. Routine IRDS grades showed limited prognostic value (AUROC 0.57 $\pm$ 0.11), confirming the need of learned markers. Our approach demonstrates that domain-specific pretraining enables accurate BPD prediction from routine day-1 radiographs. Through progressive freezing and linear probing, the method remains computationally feasible for site-level implementation and future federated learning deployments.

Abstract: Increasingly, web content is automatically generated by large language models (LLMs) with little human input. We call this "LLM-dominant" content. Since LLMs plagiarize and hallucinate, LLM-dominant content can be unreliable and unethical. Yet, websites rarely disclose such content, and human readers struggle to distinguish it. Thus, we must develop reliable detectors for LLM-dominant content. However, state-of-the-art LLM detectors are inaccurate on web content, because web content has low positive rates, complex markup, and diverse genres, instead of clean, prose-like benchmark data SoTA detectors are optimized for.
  We propose a highly reliable, scalable pipeline that classifies entire websites. Instead of naively classifying text extracted from each page, we classify each site based on an LLM text detector's outputs of multiple prose-like pages to boost accuracies. We train and evaluate our detector by collecting 2 distinct ground truth datasets totaling 120 sites, and obtain 100% accuracies testing across them. In the wild, we detect a sizable portion of sites as LLM-dominant among 10k sites in search engine results and 10k in Common Crawl archives. We find LLM-dominant sites are growing in prevalence and rank highly in search results, raising questions about their impact on end users and the overall Web ecosystem.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents often struggle in environments where rules and required domain knowledge frequently change, such as regulatory compliance and user risk screening. Current approaches, like offline fine-tuning and standard prompting, are insufficient because they cannot effectively adapt to new knowledge during actual operation. To address this limitation, we propose the Adaptive Reflective Interactive Agent (ARIA), an LLM agent framework designed specifically to continuously learn updated domain knowledge at test time. ARIA assesses its own uncertainty through structured self-dialogue, proactively identifying knowledge gaps and requesting targeted explanations or corrections from human experts. It then systematically updates an internal, timestamped knowledge repository with provided human guidance, detecting and resolving conflicting or outdated knowledge through comparisons and clarification queries. We evaluate ARIA on the realistic customer due diligence name screening task on TikTok Pay, alongside publicly available dynamic knowledge tasks. Results demonstrate significant improvements in adaptability and accuracy compared to baselines using standard offline fine-tuning and existing self-improving agents. ARIA is deployed within TikTok Pay serving over 150 million monthly active users, confirming its practicality and effectiveness for operational use in rapidly evolving environments.

<title>TriP-LLM: A Tri-Branch Patch-wise Large Language Model Framework for Time-Series Anomaly Detection</title>

Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection plays a central role across a wide range of application domains. With the increasing proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart manufacturing, time-series data has dramatically increased in both scale and dimensionality. This growth has exposed the limitations of traditional statistical methods in handling the high heterogeneity and complexity of such data. Inspired by the recent success of large language models (LLMs) in multimodal tasks across language and vision domains, we propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection framework: A Tri-Branch Patch-wise Large Language Model Framework for Time-Series Anomaly Detection (TriP-LLM). TriP-LLM integrates local and global temporal features through a triple-branch design comprising Patching, Selecting, and Global modules, to encode the input time-series into patch-wise representations, which are then processed by a frozen, pretrained LLM. A lightweight patch-wise decoder reconstructs the input, from which anomaly scores are derived. We evaluate TriP-LLM on several public benchmark datasets using PATE, a recently proposed threshold-free evaluation metric, and conduct all comparisons within a unified open-source framework to ensure fairness. Experimental results show that TriP-LLM consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across all datasets, demonstrating strong detection capabilities. Furthermore, through extensive ablation studies, we verify the substantial contribution of the LLM to the overall architecture. Compared to LLM-based approaches using Channel Independence (CI) patch processing, TriP-LLM achieves significantly lower memory consumption, making it more suitable for GPU memory-constrained environments. All code and model checkpoints of TriP-LLM are publicly available on https://github.com/YYZStart/TriP-LLM.git

Abstract: Graph routing problems play a vital role in web-related networks, where finding optimal paths across graphs is essential for efficient data transmission and content delivery. Classic routing formulations such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) represent fundamental graph optimization challenges. Recent data-driven optimization methods have made significant progress, yet they often face limitations in training efficiency and generalization to large-scale instances. In this paper, we propose a novel Vision-augmented Asymmetric Group Preference Optimization (VAGPO) approach. By leveraging ResNet-based visual encoding and Transformer-based sequential modeling, VAGPO captures both spatial structure and temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we introduce an asymmetric group preference optimization strategy that significantly accelerates convergence compared to commonly used policy gradient methods. Experimental results on generated TSP and CVRP instances, as well as real-world datasets, demonstrate that the proposed VAGPO approach achieves highly competitive solution quality. Additionally, VAGPO exhibits strong generalization to larger instances (up to 1000 nodes) without re-training, highlighting its effectiveness in both learning efficiency and scalability.

<title>Reasoning through Exploration: A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Robust Function Calling</title>

arXiv:2508.05118v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effective training of Large Language Models (LLMs) for function calling faces a critical challenge: balancing exploration of complex reasoning paths with stable policy optimization. Standard methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) fail to instill robust reasoning, and traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) struggles with inefficient exploration. We propose \textbf{EGPO}, a new RL framework built upon Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), designed to address this challenge directly. The core of EGPO is an entropy-enhanced advantage function that integrates the entropy of the model's Chain-of-Thought (CoT) into the policy gradient computation. This encourages the generation of diverse reasoning strategies. To maintain optimization direction, the entropy bonus is carefully constrained by a clipping mechanism. Complemented by a strict, binary reward signal, EGPO effectively guides the model towards discovering structured and accurate tool invocation patterns. On the challenging Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard (BFCL), a 4B-parameter model trained with EGPO sets a new state-of-the-art among models of comparable size, surpassing a range of strong competitors, including GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5.

<title>AMFT: Aligning LLM Reasoners by Meta-Learning the Optimal Imitation-Exploration Balance</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06944</link>

arXiv:2508.06944v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically fine-tuned for reasoning tasks through a two-stage pipeline of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL), a process fraught with catastrophic forgetting and suboptimal trade-offs between imitation and exploration. Recent single-stage methods attempt to unify SFT and RL using heuristics, but lack a principled mechanism for dynamically balancing the two paradigms. In this paper, we reframe this challenge through the theoretical lens of \textbf{implicit rewards}, viewing SFT and RL not as distinct methods but as complementary reward signals. We introduce \textbf{Adaptive Meta Fine-Tuning (AMFT)}, a novel single-stage algorithm that learns the optimal balance between SFT's implicit, path-level reward and RL's explicit, outcome-based reward. The core of AMFT is a \textbf{meta-gradient adaptive weight controller} that treats the SFT-RL balance as a learnable parameter, dynamically optimizing it to maximize long-term task performance. This forward-looking approach, regularized by policy entropy for stability, autonomously discovers an effective training curriculum. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on challenging benchmarks spanning mathematical reasoning, abstract visual reasoning (General Points), and vision-language navigation (V-IRL). AMFT consistently establishes a new state-of-the-art and demonstrats superior generalization on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. Ablation studies and training dynamic analysis confirm that the meta-learning controller is crucial for AMFT's stability, sample efficiency, and performance, offering a more principled and effective paradigm for LLM alignment.

Abstract: Accurately predicting beam-level reference signal received power (RSRP) is essential for beam management in dense multi-user wireless networks, yet challenging due to high measurement overhead and fast channel variations. This paper proposes Neural Beam Field (NBF), a hybrid neural-physical framework for efficient and interpretable spatial beam RSRP prediction. Central to our approach is the introduction of the Multi-path Conditional Power Profile (MCPP), a learnable physical intermediary representing the site-specific propagation environment. This approach decouples the environment from specific antenna/beam configurations, which helps the model learn site-specific multipath features and enhances its generalization capability. We adopt a decoupled ``blackbox-whitebox" design: a Transformer-based deep neural network (DNN) learns the MCPP from sparse user measurements and positions, while a physics-inspired module analytically infers beam RSRP statistics. To improve convergence and adaptivity, we further introduce a Pretrain-and-Calibrate (PaC) strategy that leverages ray-tracing priors for physics-grounded pretraining and then RSRP data for on-site calibration. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that NBF significantly outperforms conventional table-based channel knowledge maps (CKMs) and pure blackbox DNNs in prediction accuracy, training efficiency, and generalization, while maintaining a compact model size. The proposed framework offers a scalable and physically grounded solution for intelligent beam management in next-generation dense wireless networks.

arXiv:2508.07819v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) due to a critical adaptation gap: they lack the local inductive biases required for dense prediction and employ inflexible feature fusion paradigms. We address these limitations through an Architectural Co-Design framework that jointly refines feature representation and cross-modal fusion. Our method proposes a parameter-efficient Convolutional Low-Rank Adaptation (Conv-LoRA) adapter to inject local inductive biases for fine-grained representation, and introduces a Dynamic Fusion Gateway (DFG) that leverages visual context to adaptively modulate text prompts, enabling a powerful bidirectional fusion. Extensive experiments on diverse industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness, validating that this synergistic co-design is critical for robustly adapting foundation models to dense perception tasks.

Abstract: Learning clients embeddings from sequences of their historic communications is central to financial applications. While large language models (LLMs) offer general world knowledge, their direct use on long event sequences is computationally expensive and impractical in real-world pipelines. In this paper, we propose LATTE, a contrastive learning framework that aligns raw event embeddings with semantic embeddings from frozen LLMs. Behavioral features are summarized into short prompts, embedded by the LLM, and used as supervision via contrastive loss. The proposed approach significantly reduces inference cost and input size compared to conventional processing of complete sequence by LLM. We experimentally show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques for learning event sequence representations on real-world financial datasets while remaining deployable in latency-sensitive environments.

<title>On-Policy RL Meets Off-Policy Experts: Harmonizing Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning via Dynamic Weighting</title>

arXiv:2508.11408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are two prominent post-training paradigms for refining the capabilities and aligning the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing approaches that integrate SFT and RL often face the risk of disrupting established response patterns and inducing overfitting to expert data. To address this, we present a novel investigation into the unified view of SFT and RL through an off-policy versus on-policy lens. We propose CHORD, a framework for Controllable Harmonization of On- and Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning via Dynamic Weighting, which reframes SFT not as a separate stage but as a dynamically weighted auxiliary objective within the on-policy RL process. Based on an analysis of off-policy expert data's influence at both holistic and granular levels, we incorporate a dual-control mechanism in CHORD. Specifically, the framework first employs a global coefficient to holistically guide the transition from off-policy imitation to on-policy exploration, and then applies a token-wise weighting function that enables granular learning from the expert, which promotes on-policy exploration and mitigates disruption from off-policy data. We conduct extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning problems and practical tool-use tasks, providing empirical evidence that CHORD achieves a stable and efficient learning process. By effectively harmonizing off-policy expert data with on-policy exploration, CHORD demonstrates significant improvements over baselines. We release the implementation at https://github.com/modelscope/Trinity-RFT/tree/main/examples/mix_chord to inspire further research.

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based large language models (LLMs) is challenging due to their massive computational requirements and the resource constraints of participants. Existing working attempts to fill this gap through model quantization, computation offloading, or expert pruning. However, they cannot achieve desired performance due to impractical system assumptions and a lack of consideration for MoE-specific characteristics. In this paper, we propose FLUX, a system designed to enable federated fine-tuning of MoE-based LLMs across participants with constrained computing resources (e.g., consumer-grade GPUs), aiming to minimize time-to-accuracy. FLUX introduces three key innovations: (1) quantization-based local profiling to estimate expert activation with minimal overhead, (2) adaptive layer-aware expert merging to reduce resource consumption while preserving accuracy, and (3) dynamic expert role assignment using an exploration-exploitation strategy to balance tuning and non-tuning experts. Extensive experiments on LLaMA-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE with multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that FLUX significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving up to 4.75X speedup in time-to-accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as evaluators of text quality, yet the validity of their judgments remains underexplored. This study investigates systematic bias in self- and cross-model evaluations across three prominent LLMs: ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude. We designed a controlled experiment in which blog posts authored by each model were evaluated by all three models under four labeling conditions: no attribution, true attribution, and two false-attribution scenarios. Evaluations employed both holistic preference voting and granular quality ratings across three dimensions Coherence, Informativeness, and Conciseness with all scores normalized to percentages for direct comparison. Our findings reveal pronounced asymmetries in model judgments: the "Claude" label consistently elevated scores regardless of actual authorship, while the "Gemini" label systematically depressed them. False attribution frequently reversed preference rankings, producing shifts of up to 50 percentage points in voting outcomes and up to 12 percentage points in quality ratings. Notably, Gemini exhibited severe self-deprecation under true labels, while Claude demonstrated intensified self-preference. These results demonstrate that perceived model identity can substantially distort both high-level judgments and fine-grained quality assessments, independent of content quality. Our findings challenge the reliability of LLM-as-judge paradigms and underscore the critical need for blind evaluation protocols and diverse multi-model validation frameworks to ensure fairness and validity in automated text evaluation and LLM benchmarking.

Abstract: Protecting endangered wildlife from illegal poaching presents a critical challenge, particularly in vast and partially observable environments where real-time response is essential. This paper introduces a novel Expectation-Maximization (EM) based latent variable modeling approach in the context of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) coordination in wildlife protection. By modeling hidden environmental factors and inter-agent dynamics through latent variables, our method enhances exploration and coordination under uncertainty.We implement and evaluate our EM-MARL framework using a custom simulation involving 10 UAVs tasked with patrolling protected habitats of the endangered Iranian leopard. Extensive experimental results demonstrate superior performance in detection accuracy, adaptability, and policy convergence when compared to standard algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). Our findings underscore the potential of combining EM inference with MARL to improve decentralized decisionmaking in complex, high-stakes conservation scenarios. The full implementation, simulation environment, and training scripts are publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: Making large language models (LLMs) more efficient in memory, latency, and serving cost is crucial for edge deployment, interactive applications, and sustainable inference at scale. Pruning is a promising technique, but existing pruning methods are limited: width pruning often breaks the standard transformer layout, requiring custom inference code, while depth pruning can cause abrupt accuracy drops. Also, while many pruning approaches are effective against LLMs, they struggle to maintain performance on small language models (SLMs). In this work, we propose COMPACT, which jointly (i) prunes rare vocabulary to shrink embedding/LM head layers and (ii) prunes FFN intermediate channels using common-token-weighted activations, aligning importance with the post-pruning token distribution. COMPACT inherits strengths of both depth and width pruning, such as: deployment-friendliness (keeps a standard transformer architecture), scale-adaptivity (trade off vocab. vs. FFN pruning), competitive pruning times, and strong memory savings alongside throughput gains. Experiments across Qwen, LLaMA, and Gemma families (0.5B-70B) show state-of-the-art downstream performance, with substantial reductions in parameters, GPU memory, and latency.

Abstract: How should well-being be prioritised in society, and what trade-offs are people willing to make between fairness and personal well-being? We investigate these questions using a stated preference experiment with a nationally representative UK sample (n = 300), in which participants evaluated life satisfaction outcomes for both themselves and others under conditions of uncertainty. Individual-level utility functions were estimated using an Expected Utility Maximisation (EUM) framework and tested for sensitivity to the overweighting of small probabilities, as characterised by Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT). A majority of participants displayed concave (risk-averse) utility curves and showed stronger aversion to inequality in societal life satisfaction outcomes than to personal risk. These preferences were unrelated to political alignment, suggesting a shared normative stance on fairness in well-being that cuts across ideological boundaries. The results challenge use of average life satisfaction as a policy metric, and support the development of nonlinear utility-based alternatives that more accurately reflect collective human values. Implications for public policy, well-being measurement, and the design of value-aligned AI systems are discussed.

Abstract: Refusal on harmful prompts is a key safety behaviour in instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs), yet the internal causes of this behaviour remain poorly understood. We study two public instruction-tuned models, Gemma-2-2B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-8B-IT, using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) trained on residual-stream activations. Given a harmful prompt, we search the SAE latent space for feature sets whose ablation flips the model from refusal to compliance, demonstrating causal influence and creating a jailbreak. Our search proceeds in three stages: (1) Refusal Direction: find a refusal-mediating direction and collect SAE features near that direction; (2) Greedy Filtering: prune to a minimal set; and (3) Interaction Discovery: fit a factorization machine (FM) that captures nonlinear interactions among the remaining active features and the minimal set. This pipeline yields a broad set of jailbreak-critical features, offering insight into the mechanistic basis of refusal. Moreover, we find evidence of redundant features that remain dormant unless earlier features are suppressed. Our findings highlight the potential for fine-grained auditing and targeted intervention in safety behaviours by manipulating the interpretable latent space.

Abstract: We introduce MOCHA (Multi-modal Objects-aware Cross-arcHitecture Alignment), a knowledge distillation approach that transfers region-level multimodal semantics from a large vision-language teacher (e.g., LLaVa) into a lightweight vision-only object detector student (e.g., YOLO). A translation module maps student features into a joint space, where the training of the student and translator is guided by a dual-objective loss that enforces both local alignment and global relational consistency. Unlike prior approaches focused on dense or global alignment, MOCHA operates at the object level, enabling efficient transfer of semantics without modifying the teacher or requiring textual input at inference. We validate our method across four personalized detection benchmarks under few-shot regimes. Results show consistent gains over baselines, with a +10.1 average score improvement. Despite its compact architecture, MOCHA reaches performance on par with larger multimodal models, proving its suitability for real-world deployment.

<title>RPG: A Repository Planning Graph for Unified and Scalable Codebase Generation</title>

Abstract: Large language models excel at generating individual functions or single files of code, yet generating complete repositories from scratch remains a fundamental challenge. This capability is key to building coherent software systems from high-level specifications and realizing the full potential of automated code generation. The process requires planning at two levels: deciding what features and modules to build (proposal stage) and defining their implementation details (implementation stage). Current approaches rely on natural language planning, which often produces unclear specifications, misaligned components, and brittle designs due to its inherent ambiguity and lack of structure. To address these limitations, we introduce the Repository Planning Graph (RPG), a structured representation that encodes capabilities, file structures, data flows, and functions in a unified graph. By replacing free-form natural language with an explicit blueprint, RPG enables consistent long-horizon planning for repository generation. Building on RPG, we develop ZeroRepo, a graph-driven framework that operates in three stages: proposal-level planning, implementation-level construction, and graph-guided code generation with test validation. To evaluate, we construct RepoCraft, a benchmark of six real-world projects with 1,052 tasks. On RepoCraft, ZeroRepo produces nearly 36K Code Lines and 445K Code Tokens, on average 3.9$\times$ larger than the strongest baseline (Claude Code), and 68$\times$ larger than other baselines. It achieves 81.5% coverage and 69.7% test accuracy, improving over Claude Code by 27.3 and 35.8 points. Further analysis shows that RPG models complex dependencies, enables more sophisticated planning through near-linear scaling, and improves agent understanding of repositories, thus accelerating localization.

Abstract: The training scale of large language models (LLMs) has reached tens of thousands of GPUs and is still continuously expanding, enabling faster learning of larger models. Accompanying the expansion of the resource scale is the prevalence of failures (CUDA error, NaN values, job hang, etc.), which poses significant challenges to training stability. Any large-scale LLM training infrastructure should strive for minimal training interruption, efficient fault diagnosis, and effective failure tolerance to enable highly efficient continuous training. This paper presents ByteRobust, a large-scale GPU infrastructure management system tailored for robust and stable training of LLMs. It exploits the uniqueness of LLM training process and gives top priorities to detecting and recovering failures in a routine manner. Leveraging parallelisms and characteristics of LLM training, ByteRobust enables high-capacity fault tolerance, prompt fault demarcation, and localization with an effective data-driven approach, comprehensively ensuring continuous and efficient training of LLM tasks. ByteRobust is deployed on a production GPU platform with over 200,000 GPUs and achieves 97% ETTR for a three-month training job on 9,600 GPUs.

Abstract: Digital representations of individuals ("digital twins") promise to transform social science and decision-making. Yet it remains unclear whether such twins truly mirror the people they emulate. We conducted 19 preregistered studies with a representative U.S. panel and their digital twins, each constructed from rich individual-level data, enabling direct comparisons between human and twin behavior across a wide range of domains and stimuli (including never-seen-before ones). Twins reproduced individual responses with 75% accuracy and seemingly low correlation with human answers (approximately 0.2). However, this apparently high accuracy was no higher than that achieved by generic personas based on demographics only. In contrast, correlation improved when twins incorporated detailed personal information, even outperforming traditional machine learning benchmarks that require additional data. Twins exhibited systematic strengths and weaknesses - performing better in social and personality domains, but worse in political ones - and were more accurate for participants with higher education, higher income, and moderate political views and religious attendance. Together, these findings delineate both the promise and the current limits of digital twins: they capture some relative differences among individuals but not yet the unique judgments of specific people. All data and code are publicly available to support the further development and evaluation of digital twin pipelines.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across general NLP tasks, but their utility in automating numerical experiments of complex physical system -- a critical and labor-intensive component -- remains underexplored. As the major workhorse of computational science over the past decades, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) offers a uniquely challenging testbed for evaluating the scientific capabilities of LLMs. We introduce CFDLLMBench, a benchmark suite comprising three complementary components -- CFDQuery, CFDCodeBench, and FoamBench -- designed to holistically evaluate LLM performance across three key competencies: graduate-level CFD knowledge, numerical and physical reasoning of CFD, and context-dependent implementation of CFD workflows. Grounded in real-world CFD practices, our benchmark combines a detailed task taxonomy with a rigorous evaluation framework to deliver reproducible results and quantify LLM performance across code executability, solution accuracy, and numerical convergence behavior. CFDLLMBench establishes a solid foundation for the development and evaluation of LLM-driven automation of numerical experiments for complex physical systems. Code and data are available at https://github.com/NREL-Theseus/cfdllmbench/.

Abstract: Vision language models(VLMs) are increasingly integrated into clinical workflows, but they often exhibit sycophantic behavior prioritizing alignment with user phrasing social cues or perceived authority over evidence based reasoning. This study evaluate clinical sycophancy in medical visual question answering through a novel clinically grounded benchmark. We propose a medical sycophancy dataset construct from PathVQA, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD stratified by different type organ system and modality. Using psychologically motivated pressure templates including various sycophancy. In our adversarial experiments on various VLMs, we found that these models are generally vulnerable, exhibiting significant variations in the occurrence of adversarial responses, with weak correlations to the model accuracy or size. Imitation and expert provided corrections were found to be the most effective triggers, suggesting that the models possess a bias mechanism independent of visual evidence. To address this, we propose Visual Information Purification for Evidence based Response (VIPER) a lightweight mitigation strategy that filters non evidentiary content for example social pressures and then generates constrained evidence first answers. This framework reduces sycophancy by an average amount outperforming baselines while maintaining interpretability. Our benchmark analysis and mitigation framework lay the groundwork for robust deployment of medical VLMs in real world clinician interactions emphasizing the need for evidence anchored defenses.

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) learns a reward function to explain expert demonstrations. Modern IRL methods often use the adversarial (minimax) formulation that alternates between reward and policy optimization, which often lead to unstable training. Recent non-adversarial IRL approaches improve stability by jointly learning reward and policy via energy-based formulations but lack formal guarantees. This work bridges this gap. We first present a unified view showing canonical non-adversarial methods explicitly or implicitly maximize the likelihood of expert behavior, which is equivalent to minimizing the expected return gap. This insight leads to our main contribution: Trust Region Reward Optimization (TRRO), a framework that guarantees monotonic improvement in this likelihood via a Minorization-Maximization process. We instantiate TRRO into Proximal Inverse Reward Optimization (PIRO), a practical and stable IRL algorithm. Theoretically, TRRO provides the IRL counterpart to the stability guarantees of Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) in forward RL. Empirically, PIRO matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in reward recovery, policy imitation with high sample efficiency on MuJoCo and Gym-Robotics benchmarks and a real-world animal behavior modeling task.

arXiv:2509.25289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce ClustRecNet - a novel deep learning (DL)-based recommendation framework for determining the most suitable clustering algorithms for a given dataset, addressing the long-standing challenge of clustering algorithm selection in unsupervised learning. To enable supervised learning in this context, we construct a comprehensive data repository comprising 34,000 synthetic datasets with diverse structural properties. Each of them was processed using 10 popular clustering algorithms. The resulting clusterings were assessed via the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) to establish ground truth labels, used for training and evaluation of our DL model. The proposed network architecture integrates convolutional, residual, and attention mechanisms to capture both local and global structural patterns from the input data. This design supports end-to-end training to learn compact representations of datasets and enables direct recommendation of the most suitable clustering algorithm, reducing reliance on handcrafted meta-features and traditional Cluster Validity Indices (CVIs). Comprehensive experiments across synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our DL model consistently outperforms conventional CVIs (e.g. Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, Davies-Bouldin, and Dunn) as well as state-of-the-art AutoML clustering recommendation approaches (e.g. ML2DAC, AutoCluster, and AutoML4Clust). Notably, the proposed model achieves a 0.497 ARI improvement over the Calinski-Harabasz index on synthetic data and a 15.3% ARI gain over the best-performing AutoML approach on real-world data.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating high-quality and diverse images. Building on these advancements, diffusion models have also demonstrated exceptional performance in text-guided image editing. A key strategy for effective image editing involves inverting the source image into editable noise maps associated with the target image. However, previous inversion methods face challenges in adhering closely to the target text prompt. The limitation arises because inverted noise maps, while enabling faithful reconstruction of the source image, restrict the flexibility needed for desired edits. To overcome this issue, we propose Editable Noise Map Inversion (ENM Inversion), a novel inversion technique that searches for optimal noise maps to ensure both content preservation and editability. We analyze the properties of noise maps for enhanced editability. Based on this analysis, our method introduces an editable noise refinement that aligns with the desired edits by minimizing the difference between the reconstructed and edited noise maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ENM Inversion outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of image editing tasks in both preservation and edit fidelity with target prompts. Our approach can also be easily applied to video editing, enabling temporal consistency and content manipulation across frames.

Abstract: Identifying key moments in long videos is essential for downstream understanding and reasoning tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new problem, Taskoriented Temporal Grounding ToTG, which aims to localize time intervals containing the necessary information based on a task's natural description. Along with the definition, we also present ToTG Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the performance on ToTG. ToTG is particularly challenging for traditional approaches due to their limited generalizability and difficulty in handling long videos. To address these challenges, we propose TimeScope, a novel framework built upon progressive reasoning. TimeScope first identifies a coarse-grained temporal scope in the long video that likely contains the key moments, and then refines this scope through finegrained moment partitioning. Additionally, we curate a highquality dataset, namely ToTG Pile, to enhance TimeScope's ability to perform progressive temporal grounding effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeScope consistently outperforms both existing temporalgrounding methods and popular MLLMs across various settings, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing this new challenging problem.

arXiv:2510.01644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from a range of vulnerabilities that allow malicious users to solicit undesirable responses through manipulation of the input text. These so-called jailbreak prompts are designed to trick the LLM into circumventing the safety guardrails put in place to keep responses acceptable to the developer's policies. In this study, we analyse the ability of different machine learning models to distinguish jailbreak prompts from genuine uses, including looking at our ability to identify jailbreaks that use previously unseen strategies. Our results indicate that using current datasets the best performance is achieved by fine tuning a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model end-to-end for identifying jailbreaks. We visualise the keywords that distinguish jailbreak from genuine prompts and conclude that explicit reflexivity in prompt structure could be a signal of jailbreak intention.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly applied in autonomous driving for unified perception and reasoning, but high inference latency hinders real-time deployment. Early-exit reduces latency by terminating inference at intermediate layers, yet its task-dependent nature limits generalization across diverse scenarios. We observe that this limitation aligns with autonomous driving: navigation systems can anticipate upcoming contexts (e.g., intersections, traffic lights), indicating which tasks will be required. We propose Nav-EE, a navigation-guided early-exit framework that precomputes task-specific exit layers offline and dynamically applies them online based on navigation priors. Experiments on CODA, Waymo, and BOSCH show that Nav-EE achieves accuracy comparable to full inference while reducing latency by up to 63.9%. Real-vehicle integration with Autoware Universe further demonstrates reduced inference latency (600ms to 300ms), supporting faster decision-making in complex scenarios. These results suggest that coupling navigation foresight with early-exit offers a viable path toward efficient deployment of large models in autonomous systems. Code and data are available at our anonymous repository: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Nav-EE-BBC4

Abstract: We present CLARITY (Clinical Assistant for Routing, Inference and Triage), an AI-driven platform designed to facilitate patient-to-specialist routing, clinical consultations, and severity assessment of patient conditions. Its hybrid architecture combines a Finite State Machine (FSM) for structured dialogue flows with collaborative agents that employ Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze symptoms and prioritize referrals to appropriate specialists. Built on a modular microservices framework, CLARITY ensures safe, efficient, and robust performance, flexible and readily scalable to meet the demands of existing workflows and IT solutions in healthcare. We report integration of our clinical assistant into a large-scale national interhospital platform, with more than 55,000 content-rich user dialogues completed within the two months of deployment, 2,500 of which were expert-annotated for subsequent validation. The validation results show that CLARITY surpasses human-level performance in terms of the first-attempt routing precision, naturally requiring up to 3 times shorter duration of the consultation than with a human.

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in various generative tasks recently, but their training typically relies on large-scale datasets that inevitably contain imprecise information in conditional inputs. Such supervision, often stemming from noisy, ambiguous, or incomplete labels, will cause condition mismatch and degrade generation quality. To address this challenge, we propose DMIS, a unified framework for training robust Diffusion Models from Imprecise Supervision, which is the first systematic study within diffusion models. Our framework is derived from likelihood maximization and decomposes the objective into generative and classification components: the generative component models imprecise-label distributions, while the classification component leverages a diffusion classifier to infer class-posterior probabilities, with its efficiency further improved by an optimized timestep sampling strategy. Extensive experiments on diverse forms of imprecise supervision, covering tasks of image generation, weakly supervised learning, and noisy dataset condensation demonstrate that DMIS consistently produces high-quality and class-discriminative samples.

arXiv:2510.03243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient scheduling of LLM inference tasks is essential for achieving low latency and high throughput, particularly with the growing use of reasoning-capable LLMs. Traditional strategies like First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) often suffer from Head-of-Line (HOL) blocking, where long-running tasks delay shorter ones queued behind them. In this paper, we introduce PARS, a prompt-aware LLM task scheduler that improves serving efficiency by approximating shortest-job-first (SJF) scheduling through pairwise ranking with margin ranking loss. PARS focuses on impactful scheduling decisions and is seamlessly integrated into the state-of-the-art LLM serving system vLLM. It effectively predicts response-length-based task ordering, reducing latency with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and real-world inference datasets show that PARS significantly improves performance, including for reasoning workloads. Furthermore, our cross-model evaluations demonstrate that the design generalizes well, enabling effective scheduling even when predictors are trained on different LLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal protein language models deliver strong performance on mutation-effect prediction, but training such models from scratch demands substantial computational resources. In this paper, we propose a fine-tuning framework called InstructPLM-mu and try to answer a question: \textit{Can multimodal fine-tuning of a pretrained, sequence-only protein language model match the performance of models trained end-to-end? } Surprisingly, our experiments show that fine-tuning ESM2 with structural inputs can reach performance comparable to ESM3. To understand how this is achieved, we systematically compare three different feature-fusion designs and fine-tuning recipes. Our results reveal that both the fusion method and the tuning strategy strongly affect final accuracy, indicating that the fine-tuning process is not trivial. We hope this work offers practical guidance for injecting structure into pretrained protein language models and motivates further research on better fusion mechanisms and fine-tuning protocols.

arXiv:2510.03807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) integrated with Digital Twin (DT) technology face critical limitations in achieving real-time performance for mission-critical industrial applications. Existing 5G-enabled systems suffer from latencies exceeding 10ms, which are inadequate for applications requiring sub-millisecond response times, such as autonomous industrial control and predictive maintenance. This research aims to develop and validate a 6G-enabled Digital Twin framework that achieves ultra-low latency communication and real-time synchronization between physical industrial assets and their digital counterparts, specifically targeting bearing fault detection as a critical industrial use case. The proposed framework integrates terahertz communications (0.1-1 THz), intelligent reflecting surfaces, and edge artificial intelligence within a five-layer architecture. Experimental validation was conducted using the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing dataset, implementing comprehensive feature extraction (15 time and frequency domain features) and Random Forest classification algorithms. The system performance was evaluated against traditional WiFi-6 and 5G networks across multiple metrics, including classification accuracy, end-to-end latency, and scalability. It achieved 97.7% fault classification accuracy with 0.8ms end-to-end latency, representing a 15.6x improvement over WiFi-6 (12.5ms) and 5.25x improvement over 5G (4.2ms) networks. The system demonstrated superior scalability with sub-linear processing time growth and maintained consistent performance across four bearing fault categories (normal, inner race, outer race, and ball faults) with macro-averaged F1-scores exceeding 97%.

arXiv:2510.04212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of computational efficiency has driven the adoption of low-precision formats for training transformer models. However, this progress is often hindered by notorious training instabilities. This paper provides the first mechanistic explanation for a long-standing and unresolved failure case where training with flash attention in low-precision settings leads to catastrophic loss explosion. Our in-depth analysis reveals that the failure is not a random artifact but caused by two intertwined phenomena: the emergence of similar low-rank representations within the attention mechanism and the compounding effect of biased rounding errors inherent in low-precision arithmetic. We demonstrate how these factors create a vicious cycle of error accumulation that corrupts weight updates, ultimately derailing the training dynamics. To validate our findings, we introduce a minimal modification to the flash attention that mitigates the bias in rounding errors. This simple change stabilizes the training process, confirming our analysis and offering a practical solution to this persistent problem. Code is available at https://github.com/ucker/why-low-precision-training-fails.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across vision-language tasks, yet their large-scale deployment raises pressing concerns about memorized private data, outdated knowledge, and harmful content. Existing unlearning approaches for MLLMs typically adapt training-based strategies such as gradient ascent or preference optimization, but these methods are computationally expensive, irreversible, and often distort retained knowledge. In this work, we propose MLLMEraser, an input-aware, training-free framework for test-time unlearning. Our approach leverages activation steering to enable dynamic knowledge erasure without parameter updates. Specifically, we construct a multimodal erasure direction by contrasting adversarially perturbed, knowledge-recall image-text pairs with knowledge-erasure counterparts, capturing both textual and visual discrepancies. To prevent unnecessary interference, we further design an input-aware steering mechanism that adaptively determines when and how the erasure direction should be applied, preserving utility on retained knowledge while enforcing forgetting on designated content. Experiments on LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-2.5-VL demonstrate that MLLMEraser consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM unlearning baselines, achieving stronger forgetting performance with lower computational cost and minimal utility degradation.

Abstract: During fine-tuning, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly vulnerable to data-poisoning backdoor attacks, which compromise their reliability and trustworthiness. However, existing defense strategies suffer from limited generalization: they only work on specific attack types or task settings. In this study, we propose Poison-to-Poison (P2P), a general and effective backdoor defense algorithm. P2P injects benign triggers with safe alternative labels into a subset of training samples and fine-tunes the model on this re-poisoned dataset by leveraging prompt-based learning. This enforces the model to associate trigger-induced representations with safe outputs, thereby overriding the effects of original malicious triggers. Thanks to this robust and generalizable trigger-based fine-tuning, P2P is effective across task settings and attack types. Theoretically and empirically, we show that P2P can neutralize malicious backdoors while preserving task performance. We conduct extensive experiments on classification, mathematical reasoning, and summary generation tasks, involving multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. The results demonstrate that our P2P algorithm significantly reduces the attack success rate compared with baseline models. We hope that the P2P can serve as a guideline for defending against backdoor attacks and foster the development of a secure and trustworthy LLM community.

<title>Revealing Interconnections between Diseases: from Statistical Methods to Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Identifying disease interconnections through manual analysis of large-scale clinical data is labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to expert disagreement. While machine learning (ML) shows promise, three critical challenges remain: (1) selecting optimal methods from the vast ML landscape, (2) determining whether real-world clinical data (e.g., electronic health records, EHRs) or structured disease descriptions yield more reliable insights, (3) the lack of "ground truth," as some disease interconnections remain unexplored in medicine. Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate broad utility, yet they often lack specialized medical knowledge. To address these gaps, we conduct a systematic evaluation of seven approaches for uncovering disease relationships based on two data sources: (i) sequences of ICD-10 codes from MIMIC-IV EHRs and (ii) the full set of ICD-10 codes, both with and without textual descriptions. Our framework integrates the following: (i) a statistical co-occurrence analysis and a masked language modeling (MLM) approach using real clinical data; (ii) domain-specific BERT variants (Med-BERT and BioClinicalBERT); (iii) a general-purpose BERT and document retrieval; and (iv) four LLMs (Mistral, DeepSeek, Qwen, and YandexGPT). Our graph-based comparison of the obtained interconnection matrices shows that the LLM-based approach produces interconnections with the lowest diversity of ICD code connections to different diseases compared to other methods, including text-based and domain-based approaches. This suggests an important implication: LLMs have limited potential for discovering new interconnections. In the absence of ground truth databases for medical interconnections between ICD codes, our results constitute a valuable medical disease ontology that can serve as a foundational resource for future clinical research and artificial intelligence applications in healthcare.

<title>Reinforce-Ada: An Adaptive Sampling Framework for Reinforce-Style LLM Training</title>

arXiv:2510.04996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning applied to large language models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks is often bottlenecked by unstable gradient estimates due to fixed and uniform sampling of responses across prompts. Prior work such as GVM-RAFT addresses this by dynamically allocating inference budget per prompt to minimize stochastic gradient variance under a budget constraint. Inspired by this insight, we propose Reinforce-Ada, an adaptive sampling framework for online RL post-training of LLMs that continuously reallocates sampling effort to the prompts with the greatest uncertainty or learning potential. Unlike conventional two-stage allocation methods, Reinforce-Ada interleaves estimation and sampling in an online successive elimination process, and automatically stops sampling for a prompt once sufficient signal is collected. To stabilize updates, we form fixed-size groups with enforced reward diversity and compute advantage baselines using global statistics aggregated over the adaptive sampling phase. Empirical results across multiple model architectures and reasoning benchmarks show that Reinforce-Ada accelerates convergence and improves final performance compared to GRPO, especially when using the balanced sampling variant. Our work highlights the central role of variance-aware, adaptive data curation in enabling efficient and reliable reinforcement learning for reasoning-capable LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/RLHFlow/Reinforce-Ada.

Abstract: Automating the conversion of UI images into web code is a critical task for front-end development and rapid prototyping. Advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made WebUI-to-Code increasingly feasible, yet existing benchmarks remain limited in data diversity and evaluation reliability. To address these issues, we present WebRenderBench, a large-scale benchmark of 45.1k webpages collected from real-world portal sites, offering greater diversity, complexity, and realism than prior benchmarks. We further propose a novel evaluation metric that measures layout and style consistency from the final rendered pages. Unlike vision-based methods that rely on costly LLM reasoning or structure-based comparisons vulnerable to noise and asymmetry, our approach enables more efficient, objective, and reliable UI quality assessment. Finally, we introduce the Automated Layout and Style Inspection Agent (ALISA), which integrates this metric into reinforcement learning as a reward signal to enhance training on crawled asymmetric webpages. Experiments show that ALISA significantly boosts generation performance, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple metrics.

Summary:<br />
- Log-based anomaly detection is crucial for software system reliability and performance, but labeling a large volume of logs is challenging.
- Existing anomaly detection methods heavily rely on labeling and face issues like data distribution gaps and cold-start problems.
- LogAction is a novel model that combines transfer learning and active learning techniques to address these challenges.

Abstract: Log-based anomaly detection is a essential task for ensuring the reliability and performance of software systems. However, the performance of existing anomaly detection methods heavily relies on labeling, while labeling a large volume of logs is highly challenging. To address this issue, many approaches based on transfer learning and active learning have been proposed. Nevertheless, their effectiveness is hindered by issues such as the gap between source and target system data distributions and cold-start problems. In this paper, we propose LogAction, a novel log-based anomaly detection model based on active domain adaptation. LogAction integrates transfer learning and active learning techniques. On one hand, it uses labeled data from a mature system to train a base model, mitigating the cold-start issue in active learning. On the other hand, LogAction utilize free energy-based sampling and uncertainty-based sampling to select logs located at the distribution boundaries for manual labeling, thus addresses the data distribution gap in transfer learning with minimal human labeling efforts. Experimental results on six different combinations of datasets demonstrate that LogAction achieves an average 93.01% F1 score with only 2% of manual labels, outperforming some state-of-the-art methods by 26.28%.

Summary:
Generalized orders of magnitude (GOOMs) are introduced as an extension of traditional orders of magnitude to handle compounding real numbers over long sequences without encountering catastrophic numerical underflow or overflow. GOOMs provide stable computation over larger dynamic ranges than conventional methods, particularly on parallel hardware like GPUs. An efficient custom parallel prefix scan is implemented to support native execution on such hardware. Three experiments demonstrate the superiority of GOOMs over traditional approaches: compounding real matrix products beyond standard floating-point limits, estimating Lyapunov exponents' spectra much faster, and capturing long-range dependencies in deep recurrent neural networks without requiring stabilization. GOOMs combined with parallel scanning offer a scalable and numerically robust alternative for high-dynamic-range applications. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Many domains, from deep learning to finance, require compounding real numbers over long sequences, often leading to catastrophic numerical underflow or overflow. We introduce generalized orders of magnitude (GOOMs), a principled extension of traditional orders of magnitude that incorporates floating-point numbers as a special case, and which in practice enables stable computation over significantly larger dynamic ranges of real numbers than previously possible. We implement GOOMs, along with an efficient custom parallel prefix scan, to support native execution on parallel hardware such as GPUs. We demonstrate that our implementation of GOOMs outperforms traditional approaches with three representative experiments, all of which were previously considered impractical or impossible, and now become possible and practical: (1) compounding real matrix products far beyond standard floating-point limits; (2) estimating spectra of Lyapunov exponents in parallel, orders of magnitude faster than with previous methods, applying a novel selective-resetting method to prevent state colinearity; and (3) capturing long-range dependencies in deep recurrent neural networks with non-diagonal recurrent states, computed in parallel via a prefix scan, without requiring any form of stabilization. Our results show that our implementation of GOOMs, combined with efficient parallel scanning, offers a scalable and numerically robust alternative to conventional floating-point numbers for high-dynamic-range applications.

Summary:<br />
The proposed Spatiotemporal Forecasting as Planning (SFP) paradigm addresses the challenges of stochasticity and non-differentiable metrics in physical spatiotemporal forecasting. SFP utilizes a Generative World Model to simulate diverse future states and employs a base forecasting model as an agent guided by a beam search-based planning algorithm. This approach leverages non-differentiable domain metrics as reward signals to explore high-return future sequences. High-reward candidates identified through this process serve as pseudo-labels to optimize the agent's policy via iterative self-training, reducing prediction error significantly. The SFP framework demonstrates exceptional performance in capturing extreme events, showcasing its effectiveness in spatiotemporal forecasting tasks. <div>

Abstract: To address the dual challenges of inherent stochasticity and non-differentiable metrics in physical spatiotemporal forecasting, we propose Spatiotemporal Forecasting as Planning (SFP), a new paradigm grounded in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning. SFP constructs a novel Generative World Model to simulate diverse, high-fidelity future states, enabling an "imagination-based" environmental simulation. Within this framework, a base forecasting model acts as an agent, guided by a beam search-based planning algorithm that leverages non-differentiable domain metrics as reward signals to explore high-return future sequences. These identified high-reward candidates then serve as pseudo-labels to continuously optimize the agent's policy through iterative self-training, significantly reducing prediction error and demonstrating exceptional performance on critical domain metrics like capturing extreme events.

Abstract: We introduce MacroBench, a code-first benchmark that evaluates whether LLMs can synthesize reusable browser-automation programs (macros) from natural-language goals by reading HTML/DOM and emitting Selenium. MacroBench instantiates seven self-hosted sites covering 681 tasks across interaction complexity and targeting difficulty. Our end-to-end protocol validates generated code via static checks, sandboxed execution, and outcome verification (DOM assertions, database snapshots), and includes a safety suite for scraping, spam/abuse, and credential/privacy prompts. Across 2,636 model-task runs, we observe stratified success: GPT-4o-mini (96.8%), GPT-4o (95.3%), Gemini (89.0%), DeepSeek (83.4%). Models handle simple tasks reliably (91.7%) but fail on complex workflows (0.0%), and none meet production-quality coding practices despite functional completion.

Summary:
This paper presents Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD), a novel decoding scheme that integrates neural language generation with knowledge bases through semantic guards. The proposed constraint-based semantics enable oracle filtering as a program-logic judgment, ensuring sound and complete guards for greedy selection. An entropy-style invariant measures factual risk using knowledge-aware safe mass. Additionally, a multi-agent operational calculus with verified Lean artefacts certifies implementation behavior. Numerical and algorithmic case studies demonstrate that the guardrails mitigate hallucinations without compromising efficiency.

Abstract: This paper introduces Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD), a verification-oriented decoding scheme that aligns neural language generation with knowledge bases. Situated in the tradition of probabilistic program semantics for sequence models, TAD augments modern instruction-tuned systems with a lattice of semantic guards that operate at decode time. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) a constraint-based semantics that renders oracle filtering as a program-logic judgment, (ii) a proof that greedy selection enjoys local likelihood dominance under sound and complete guards (Theorem 2.7), (iii) an entropy-style invariant that quantifies factual risk via knowledge-aware safe mass, and (iv) a multi-agent operational calculus with verified Lean artefacts to certify implementation behaviour. Numerical and algorithmic case studies confirm that the resulting guardrails reduce hallucinations without sacrificing throughput, yielding a pragmatic bridge between large-scale empirical models and formal verification.

Summary:
The paper introduces L2M-AID, a framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense utilizing Multi-agent reinforcement learning powered by Large Language Models. It addresses the increasing threat landscape faced by Industrial IoT systems through contextual awareness and semantic representation of telemetry data. By leveraging a semantic bridge provided by LLMs, collaborative agents can reason about adversary intent to enhance security measures. The framework combines LLMs with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, achieving complex cooperative strategies to balance security objectives and operational imperatives. Experimental validation on SWaT and synthetic datasets showcases L2M-AID's superior performance in threat detection, false positive reduction, and response time improvement compared to traditional IDS and deep learning detectors. Notably, L2M-AID excels in maintaining physical process stability, making it a robust solution for securing critical infrastructure. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.07363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing integration of Industrial IoT (IIoT) exposes critical cyber-physical systems to sophisticated, multi-stage attacks that elude traditional defenses lacking contextual awareness. This paper introduces L2M-AID, a novel framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense using LLM-empowered, Multi-agent reinforcement learning. L2M-AID orchestrates a team of collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to achieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep fusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to translate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state representation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than merely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative strategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security objectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly penalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a novel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&amp;CK for ICS framework. Results demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS, deep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key metrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by over 80% and improving response times by a factor of four. Crucially, it demonstrates superior performance in maintaining physical process stability, presenting a robust new paradigm for securing critical national infrastructure.

<div> reasoning mechanisms, language models, DeepSeek R1, hybrid model, performance gap

Summary:<br />This work investigates why thinking language models like DeepSeek R1 outperform base models. The study introduces a hybrid model that activates reasoning mechanisms in base models at the right time to achieve thinking-model-level reasoning chains. Through an unsupervised approach, human-interpretable reasoning behaviors in thinking models are uncovered. The hybrid model successfully recovers up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking models without weight updates, steering only 12% of tokens. The findings suggest that thinking models mostly acquire reasoning mechanisms during pre-training, with post-training focusing on efficient deployment of these mechanisms at the appropriate times for enhanced task performance. This refines our understanding of how thinking models are trained and highlights the importance of deploying reasoning mechanisms efficiently for optimal inference-time compute utilization.

Abstract: Why do thinking language models like DeepSeek R1 outperform their base counterparts? Despite consistent performance gains, it remains unclear to what extent thinking models learn entirely new reasoning capabilities or repurpose pre-existing base model ones. In this work, we propose a hybrid model where we activate reasoning mechanisms in base models at the right time to elicit thinking-model-level reasoning chains, implying that thinking models exploit already existing capabilities. To ground our analysis, we introduce an unsupervised, bottom-up approach for uncovering human-interpretable reasoning behaviors in thinking models. This approach provides an unbiased method to discover reasoning behaviors without imposing manual or LLM-derived assumptions. Across three base and four thinking models, using GSM8K and MATH500, our hybrid model recovers up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking models without any weight updates while steering only 12% of tokens. Concretely, our empirical setup provides a simple, causal way to test the effectiveness of existing reasoning mechanisms in base models by invoking them directly and measuring the resulting task performance. More broadly, these results reframe our understanding of how thinking models are trained: pre-training is when models acquire most of their reasoning mechanisms, and post-training teaches efficient deployment of these mechanisms at the right time, enabling efficient use of their inference-time compute.

Abstract: Static solutions don't serve a dynamic mind. Thus, we advocate a shift from static mental health diagnostic assessments to continuous, artificial intelligence (AI)-driven assessment. Focusing on Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as a case study, we explore how generative AI has the potential to address current capacity constraints in neuropsychology, potentially enabling more personalized and longitudinal care pathways. In particular, AI can efficiently conduct frequent, low-level experience sampling from patients and facilitate diagnostic reconciliation across care pathways. We envision a future where mental health care benefits from continuous, rich, and patient-centered data sampling to dynamically adapt to individual patient needs and evolving conditions, thereby improving both accessibility and efficacy of treatment. We further propose the use of mental health digital twins (MHDTs) - continuously updated computational models that capture individual symptom dynamics and trajectories - as a transformative framework for personalized mental health care. We ground this framework in empirical evidence and map out the research agenda required to refine and operationalize it.

We introduce ProSEA, a modular, general-purpose multi-agent framework designed for iterative problem solving through exploration and plan evolution. ProSEA features a hierarchical architecture in which a Manager Agent orchestrates domain-specialized Expert Agents, decomposes tasks, and adaptively replans based on structured feedback from failed attempts. Unlike prior systems, ProSEA agents report not only success or failure but also detailed reasons for failure and newly discovered constraints, enabling dynamic plan refinement informed by exploratory traces. The framework operates autonomously but supports seamless integration with human collaborators when needed. Experiments on the challenging FinanceBench benchmark demonstrate that ProSEA, even without human feedback, outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves robust performance across reasoning-heavy tasks. These results underscore ProSEA's potential as a foundation for more transparent, adaptive, and human-aligned AI agents.

Summary:<br /><br />
The article introduces TESTAM+, an enhanced spatio-temporal forecasting framework that improves upon existing models by incorporating physical road network topology and data-driven feature similarity. TESTAM+ outperforms TESTAM in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on two datasets, METR LA and PEMS BAY. The strategic expert selection method in TESTAM+ is shown to be more effective than naive ensemble aggregation. The Adaptive and SpatioSemantic Experts in TESTAM+ demonstrate impressive performance, matching or surpassing the original TESTAM. The Identity + Adaptive configuration in TESTAM+ achieves a significant MAE reduction compared to the state-of-the-art MegaCRN on the METR LA dataset. Additionally, TESTAM+ reduces inference latency by over 50% compared to the full four expert model. These findings suggest that a smaller number of strategically-designed experts can outperform complex multi-expert ensembles, achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved computational efficiency for real-time deployment. <div>

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is fundamental to intelligent transportation systems, enabling congestion mitigation and emission reduction in increasingly complex urban environments. While recent graph neural network approaches have advanced spatial temporal modeling, existing mixture of experts frameworks like Time Enhanced Spatio Temporal Attention Model (TESTAM) lack explicit incorporation of physical road network topology, limiting their spatial capabilities. We present TESTAM+, an enhanced spatio temporal forecasting framework that introduces a novel SpatioSemantic Expert integrating physical road topology with data driven feature similarity through hybrid graph construction. TESTAM+ achieves significant improvements over TESTAM: 1.3% MAE reduction on METR LA (3.10 vs. 3.14) and 4.1% improvement on PEMS BAY (1.65 vs. 1.72). Through comprehensive ablation studies, we discover that strategic expert selection fundamentally outperforms naive ensemble aggregation. Individual experts demonstrate remarkable effectiveness: the Adaptive Expert achieves 1.63 MAE on PEMS BAY, outperforming the original three expert TESTAM (1.72 MAE), while the SpatioSemantic Expert matches this performance with identical 1.63 MAE. The optimal Identity + Adaptive configuration achieves an 11.5% MAE reduction compared to state of the art MegaCRN on METR LA (2.99 vs. 3.38), while reducing inference latency by 53.1% compared to the full four expert TESTAM+. Our findings reveal that fewer, strategically designed experts outperform complex multi expert ensembles, establishing new state of the art performance with superior computational efficiency for real time deployment.

<div> Keywords: large language models, time series reasoning tasks, TS-Agent, interpretability, reasoning tasks improvement

Summary: 
TS-Agent is proposed as a time series reasoning agent that utilizes large language models (LLMs) for evidence gathering and synthesis while relying on time series analytical tools for statistical and structural information extraction. The agent operates on raw numeric sequences with atomic operators, maintains an explicit evidence log, and refines its reasoning iteratively under the guidance of a self-critic and quality gate. By avoiding multi-modal alignment training, preserving the native form of time series, ensuring interpretability, and mitigating knowledge leakage or hallucination, TS-Agent achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art LLMs on understanding benchmarks and outperforms existing models in reasoning tasks, particularly in zero-shot settings where memorization-based models typically struggle. Empirical evaluations on established benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of TS-Agent in improving reasoning abilities on time series data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong abilities in reasoning and problem solving, but recent studies reveal that they still struggle with time series reasoning tasks, where outputs are often affected by hallucination or knowledge leakage. In this work we propose TS-Agent, a time series reasoning agent that leverages LLMs strictly for what they excel at, i.e., gathering evidence and synthesizing it into conclusions through step-by-step reasoning, while delegating the extraction of statistical and structural information to time series analytical tools. Instead of mapping time series into text tokens, images, or embeddings, our agent interacts with raw numeric sequences through atomic operators, records outputs in an explicit evidence log, and iteratively refines its reasoning under the guidance of a self-critic and a final quality gate. This design avoids multi-modal alignment training, preserves the native form of time series, ensures interpretability and verifiability, and mitigates knowledge leakage or hallucination. Empirically, we evaluate the agent on established benchmarks. Our experiments show that TS-Agent achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs on understanding benchmarks, and delivers significant improvements on reasoning tasks, where existing models often rely on memorization and fail in zero-shot settings.

Summary: In this study, the researchers explore the use of Language Model Models (LLMs) to understand and analyze process models using natural language interfaces. They found that even untrained LLMs like ChatGPT can effectively comprehend BPMN process models and identify errors intelligently. Different LLMs varied in performance, but overall, they were valuable assistants for business process designers. The researchers also delved into the LLMs' ability to reason and analyze processes, noting that they exhibited anthropomorphic properties. This research highlights the potential of LLMs in assisting with process analysis and optimization, showcasing their ability to provide deep insights and assist users in enhancing their processes. <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we report our experience with several LLMs for their ability to understand a process model in an interactive, conversational style, find syntactical and logical errors in it, and reason with it in depth through a natural language (NL) interface. Our findings show that a vanilla, untrained LLM like ChatGPT (model o3) in a zero-shot setting is effective in understanding BPMN process models from images and answering queries about them intelligently at syntactic, logic, and semantic levels of depth. Further, different LLMs vary in performance in terms of their accuracy and effectiveness. Nevertheless, our empirical analysis shows that LLMs can play a valuable role as assistants for business process designers and users. We also study the LLM's "thought process" and ability to perform deeper reasoning in the context of process analysis and optimization. We find that the LLMs seem to exhibit anthropomorphic properties.

Summary:
This article addresses the integration of Medical Intelligent Systems (MIS) into healthcare workflows and the resulting safety and ethical concerns. As most MIS will be classified as high-risk systems under the European Union AI Act, a formal risk management process is necessary to ensure compliance with ethical requirements for trustworthy AI. The focus is on risk reduction optimization problems, aiming to balance risk assessment values in a way that covers ethical requirements effectively. The problem is formalized as a constrained optimization task and studied using three resolution paradigms: Mixed Integer Programming, Satisfiability, and Constraint Programming.

Abstract: Medical Intelligent Systems (MIS) are increasingly integrated into healthcare workflows, offering significant benefits but also raising critical safety and ethical concerns. According to the European Union AI Act, most MIS will be classified as high-risk systems, requiring a formal risk management process to ensure compliance with the ethical requirements of trust- worthy AI. In this context, we focus on risk reduction optimization problems, which aim to reduce risks with ethical considerations by finding the best balanced assignment of risk assessment values according to their coverage of trustworthy AI ethical requirements. We formalize this problem as a constrained optimization task and investigate three resolution paradigms: Mixed Integer Programming (MIP), Satisfiability (SAT), and Constraint Pro- gramming(CP).Our contributions include the mathematical formulation of this optimization problem, its modeling with the Minizinc constraint modeling language, and a comparative experimental study that analyzes the performance, expressiveness, and scalability of each ap- proach to solving. From the identified limits of the methodology, we draw some perspectives of this work regarding the integration of the Minizinc model into a complete trustworthy AI ethical risk management process for MIS.

<div> framework, multi-agent, LLMs, geo-spatial, path query <br />
<br />
CompassLLM is introduced as a multi-agent framework that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve the popular path query in the geo-spatial domain. It consists of two stages: SEARCH, which identifies popular paths, and GENERATE, which creates new paths when no historical data exists. The framework shows superior accuracy in identifying popular paths and competitive performance in generating novel paths. Unlike traditional algorithms, CompassLLM does not require model training or parameter tuning, making it cost-effective and efficient for real-world applications. By leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, CompassLLM offers a promising approach to solving geo-spatial problems like urban planning, navigation optimization, and travel recommendations. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.07516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The popular path query - identifying the most frequented routes between locations from historical trajectory data - has important applications in urban planning, navigation optimization, and travel recommendations. While traditional algorithms and machine learning approaches have achieved success in this domain, they typically require model training, parameter tuning, and retraining when accommodating data updates. As Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate increasing capabilities in spatial and graph-based reasoning, there is growing interest in exploring how these models can be applied to geo-spatial problems.
  We introduce CompassLLM, a novel multi-agent framework that intelligently leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into the geo-spatial domain to solve the popular path query. CompassLLM employs its agents in a two-stage pipeline: the SEARCH stage that identifies popular paths, and a GENERATE stage that synthesizes novel paths in the absence of an existing one in the historical trajectory data. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show that CompassLLM demonstrates superior accuracy in SEARCH and competitive performance in GENERATE while being cost-effective.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces the concept of Multi-agent debate (MAD) and highlights the issue of identity-driven sycophancy and self-bias in large language models. A new framework is proposed to mitigate and quantify identity bias in MAD by formalizing debate dynamics as an identity-weighted Bayesian update process. The framework includes response anonymization, where identity markers are removed from prompts to reduce bias. The Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC) is defined as a metric to measure how often agents follow a peer versus themselves. Empirical studies across various models and datasets show that sycophancy is more common than self-bias. The study emphasizes the importance of masking identity to ensure that MAD systems base reasoning on content rather than source identity. The code for the framework is available on GitHub for further exploration.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.07517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) aims to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning by letting multiple agents exchange answers and then aggregate their opinions. Yet recent studies reveal that agents are not neutral: they are prone to identity-driven sycophancy and self-bias, uncritically adopting a peer's view or stubbornly adhering to their own prior output, undermining the reliability of debate. In this work, we present the first principled framework that joins sycophancy and self-bias to mitigate and quantify identity bias in MAD. First, we formalize the debate dynamics as an identity-weighted Bayesian update process. Second, we propose response anonymization: by removing identity markers from prompts, agents cannot distinguish "self" from "peer", which forces equal weights on agent identity, thereby reducing bias. Third, we define the Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC), a principled metric that measures how often an agent follows a peer versus itself. Empirical studies across multiple models, datasets and debate rounds confirm that identity bias is widespread, with sycophancy far more common than self-bias. Our findings highlight the need to "mask" identity to ensure that MAD systems reason based on content rather than source identity. Code is released in https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/MAD-identity-bias.

Summary:
The article discusses the challenges in evaluating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and highlights the need for a new, unified paradigm for trustworthy evaluation. It points out the current vulnerabilities in benchmarks due to issues like data contamination and biased evaluations. The authors argue for a paradigm shift towards a quality-controlled benchmarking framework that ensures fairness and credibility in AI evaluation. They introduce PeerBench, a community-governed evaluation blueprint that aims to restore integrity and deliver trustworthy measures of AI progress. The paper emphasizes the importance of establishing a robust evaluation system to distinguish genuine progress from exaggerated claims in the rapidly expanding AI market. <div>
arXiv:2510.07575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The meteoric rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with its rapidly expanding market capitalization, presents both transformative opportunities and critical challenges. Chief among these is the urgent need for a new, unified paradigm for trustworthy evaluation, as current benchmarks increasingly reveal critical vulnerabilities. Issues like data contamination and selective reporting by model developers fuel hype, while inadequate data quality control can lead to biased evaluations that, even if unintentionally, may favor specific approaches. As a flood of participants enters the AI space, this "Wild West" of assessment makes distinguishing genuine progress from exaggerated claims exceptionally difficult. Such ambiguity blurs scientific signals and erodes public confidence, much as unchecked claims would destabilize financial markets reliant on credible oversight from agencies like Moody's.
  In high-stakes human examinations (e.g., SAT, GRE), substantial effort is devoted to ensuring fairness and credibility; why settle for less in evaluating AI, especially given its profound societal impact? This position paper argues that the current laissez-faire approach is unsustainable. We contend that true, sustainable AI advancement demands a paradigm shift: a unified, live, and quality-controlled benchmarking framework robust by construction, not by mere courtesy and goodwill. To this end, we dissect the systemic flaws undermining today's AI evaluation, distill the essential requirements for a new generation of assessments, and introduce PeerBench, a community-governed, proctored evaluation blueprint that embodies this paradigm through sealed execution, item banking with rolling renewal, and delayed transparency. Our goal is to pave the way for evaluations that can restore integrity and deliver genuinely trustworthy measures of AI progress.

Summary: 
AgentAsk is a new module designed to address the issue of error cascades in multi-agent systems that utilize large language models (LLMs). This lightweight and easy-to-integrate module aims to improve accuracy and robustness by inserting minimal questions at potential failure points within the interaction chain. The module follows a three-stage pipeline, leveraging curated failure traces to inform its decision-making process. By optimizing online with E-GRPO, a reinforcement learning objective, AgentAsk effectively balances accuracy, latency, and cost considerations. Empirical results across various benchmarks show that AgentAsk consistently enhances performance while keeping overhead low. The module not only improves system reliability but also contributes a systematic taxonomy of edge-level errors and a practical approach for intervention, paving the way for more dependable LLM-based multi-agent systems. <div>
arXiv:2510.07593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on large language models (LLMs) promise enhanced problem-solving capabilities through collaborative division of labor. However, they frequently underperform single-agent baselines due to edge-level error cascades: minor inaccuracies at one message handoff propagate across the entire chain. We propose AgentAsk, a lightweight and plug-and-play clarification module that treats every inter-agent message as a potential failure point and inserts minimally necessary questions to arrest error propagation. AgentAsk follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) distilling edge-level judgments from curated failure traces into a compact policy, (ii) supervising the policy to determine when/what/whom/how to ask, and (iii) optimizing online with E-GRPO, a reinforcement learning objective that balances accuracy, latency, and cost. The module is architecture-agnostic and easy to integrate into existing orchestration. Across math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks, AgentAsk consistently improves accuracy and robustness over public multi-agent implementations while keeping overhead minimal, with latency and extra cost all less than 5%, approaching the performance of a strong evaluator. Beyond empirical improvements, we contribute a principled taxonomy of edge-level errors and a practical recipe for link-local intervention, offering a scalable pathway toward more reliable LLM-based multi-agent systems.

Summary:
- The study focuses on creating a traceable and accountable pipeline for sequential multi-agent systems using large language models (LLMs).
- By incorporating structured handoffs and saved records, errors can be traced back and accountability assigned when needed.
- Evaluating different configurations of LLMs on various benchmarks revealed the importance of structured handoffs in improving accuracy and preventing common failures.
- Each model within the pipeline has specific strengths and risks, quantified through repair and harm rates, highlighting the need for role-specific analysis.
- Task-dependent trade-offs between accuracy, cost, and latency suggest that heterogeneous pipelines are often the most efficient approach for designing reliable multi-agent systems.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.07614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential multi-agent systems built with large language models (LLMs) can automate complex software tasks, but they are hard to trust because errors quietly pass from one stage to the next. We study a traceable and accountable pipeline, meaning a system with clear roles, structured handoffs, and saved records that let us trace who did what at each step and assign blame when things go wrong. Our setting is a Planner -> Executor -> Critic pipeline. We evaluate eight configurations of three state-of-the-art LLMs on three benchmarks and analyze where errors start, how they spread, and how they can be fixed. Our results show: (1) adding a structured, accountable handoff between agents markedly improves accuracy and prevents the failures common in simple pipelines; (2) models have clear role-specific strengths and risks (e.g., steady planning vs. high-variance critiquing), which we quantify with repair and harm rates; and (3) accuracy-cost-latency trade-offs are task-dependent, with heterogeneous pipelines often the most efficient. Overall, we provide a practical, data-driven method for designing, tracing, and debugging reliable, predictable, and accountable multi-agent systems.

<br />
Generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI) is revolutionizing healthcare, particularly in the field of mental health. While much attention has been given to therapist chatbots, the use of generative AI to enhance and scale training in mental health service provision presents a lower-risk, high-impact alternative. By leveraging generative AI for training, individuals can be better prepared to deliver effective mental health support. A real-world case study involving veterans demonstrates the positive impact of using generative AI to improve training in mental health service provision. This approach not only improves the quality of mental health services but also enhances the ability of individuals to support one another's mental well-being. Investing in generative AI for training in mental health service provision holds significant potential for improving mental health outcomes on a larger scale.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI) is transforming healthcare. With this evolution comes optimism regarding the impact it will have on mental health, as well as concern regarding the risks that come with generative AI operating in the mental health domain. Much of the investment in, and academic and public discourse about, AI-powered solutions for mental health has focused on therapist chatbots. Despite the common assumption that chatbots will be the most impactful application of GenAI to mental health, we make the case here for a lower-risk, high impact use case: leveraging generative AI to enhance and scale training in mental health service provision. We highlight key benefits of using generative AI to help train people to provide mental health services and present a real-world case study in which generative AI improved the training of veterans to support one another's mental health. With numerous potential applications of generative AI in mental health, we illustrate why we should invest in using generative AI to support training people in mental health service provision.

Summary:
Frontier AI models have shown remarkable progress but struggle with compositional reasoning, performing poorly on established benchmarks. This study reveals that evaluation metrics underestimate model capability and introduces a group matching score to better assess performance. Adjusting for this underestimation boosts model performance significantly, with SigLIP-B16 surpassing previous results and GPT-4.1 achieving human-level performance on Winoground. The Test-Time Matching (TTM) algorithm further improves model performance iteratively, leading to state-of-the-art results on MMVP-VLM. TTM remains effective on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp, with relative gains of up to 85.7%. Across diverse setups, TTM consistently enhances model performance, advancing the frontier of compositional reasoning.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.07632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frontier AI models have achieved remarkable progress, yet recent studies suggest they struggle with compositional reasoning, often performing at or below random chance on established benchmarks. We revisit this problem and show that widely used evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model capability. To address this, we introduce a group matching score that better exploits group structure and reveals substantial hidden capability in both contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test time transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard evaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first result surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.
  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative, self-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any external supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for example, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a new state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on benchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving relative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp. Across 16 dataset variants spanning diverse setups, our experiments demonstrate that TTM consistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of compositional reasoning.

<div> Framework, Safe Off-Policy Policy Gradient, Exploration, Novel actions, Recommender systems
<br />
<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces a framework for safe exploration of novel actions in recommender systems, addressing the challenge of balancing safety and exploration. The Safe Off-Policy Policy Gradient (Safe OPG) method is proposed to ensure safety by using high confidence off-policy evaluation. The experiment shows that Safe OPG consistently meets safety requirements. However, it is noted that Safe OPG can be overly conservative, highlighting the tradeoff between safety and exploration. To overcome this, a novel approach called Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning for Safe User Exploration is introduced, which gradually relaxes safety constraints over multiple deployments. This framework allows for exploration of novel actions while maintaining safety in recommender system implementation. <div>
arXiv:2510.07635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many real recommender systems, novel items are added frequently over time. The importance of sufficiently presenting novel actions has widely been acknowledged for improving long-term user engagement. A recent work builds on Off-Policy Learning (OPL), which trains a policy from only logged data, however, the existing methods can be unsafe in the presence of novel actions. Our goal is to develop a framework to enforce exploration of novel actions with a guarantee for safety. To this end, we first develop Safe Off-Policy Policy Gradient (Safe OPG), which is a model-free safe OPL method based on a high confidence off-policy evaluation. In our first experiment, we observe that Safe OPG almost always satisfies a safety requirement, even when existing methods violate it greatly. However, the result also reveals that Safe OPG tends to be too conservative, suggesting a difficult tradeoff between guaranteeing safety and exploring novel actions. To overcome this tradeoff, we also propose a novel framework called Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning for Safe User Exploration, which leverages safety margin and gradually relaxes safety regularization during multiple (not many) deployments. Our framework thus enables exploration of novel actions while guaranteeing safe implementation of recommender systems.

<div> framework, evaluation, agents, safety, social dynamics
<br />
Generative agents in multimodal environments face challenges in reasoning about safety, coherence, and trust. A new simulation framework evaluates agents on safety improvement over time, detection of unsafe activities in various social situations, and social dynamics. Equipped with advanced features like layered memory, dynamic planning, and multimodal perception, agents are assessed using SocialMetrics for behavioral and structural metrics. Results show agents struggle to align local revisions with global safety, achieving only a 55% success rate in correcting unsafe plans. Different models exhibit varying performance, with Claude outperforming others in localized contexts. However, there is a tendency to overtrust images, with 45% of unsafe actions being accepted when paired with misleading visuals. These findings highlight limitations in current agent architectures and provide a reproducible platform for studying multimodal safety, coherence, and social dynamics.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Can generative agents be trusted in multimodal environments? Despite advances in large language and vision-language models that enable agents to act autonomously and pursue goals in rich settings, their ability to reason about safety, coherence, and trust across modalities remains limited. We introduce a reproducible simulation framework for evaluating agents along three dimensions: (1) safety improvement over time, including iterative plan revisions in text-visual scenarios; (2) detection of unsafe activities across multiple categories of social situations; and (3) social dynamics, measured as interaction counts and acceptance ratios of social exchanges. Agents are equipped with layered memory, dynamic planning, multimodal perception, and are instrumented with SocialMetrics, a suite of behavioral and structural metrics that quantifies plan revisions, unsafe-to-safe conversions, and information diffusion across networks. Experiments show that while agents can detect direct multimodal contradictions, they often fail to align local revisions with global safety, reaching only a 55 percent success rate in correcting unsafe plans. Across eight simulation runs with three models - Claude, GPT-4o mini, and Qwen-VL - five agents achieved average unsafe-to-safe conversion rates of 75, 55, and 58 percent, respectively. Overall performance ranged from 20 percent in multi-risk scenarios with GPT-4o mini to 98 percent in localized contexts such as fire/heat with Claude. Notably, 45 percent of unsafe actions were accepted when paired with misleading visuals, showing a strong tendency to overtrust images. These findings expose critical limitations in current architectures and provide a reproducible platform for studying multimodal safety, coherence, and social dynamics.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a method for incorporating signal temporal logic (STL) into reinforcement learning (RL) for control synthesis in cyber-physical systems. By continuously monitoring system behavior against an STL specification at each control step, the proposed approach generates rewards that reflect instantaneous state dynamics, improving the accuracy and stability of training performances. The method includes a smooth approximation of causation semantics to make it differentiable for deep-RL methods. An evaluation in the Gym environment on various benchmarks demonstrates that the STL-guided RL method with online causation semantics outperforms existing approaches, offering a more robust and efficient reward generation framework for deep-RL. <div>
arXiv:2510.07715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In real-time and safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPSs), control synthesis must guarantee that generated policies meet stringent timing and correctness requirements under uncertain and dynamic conditions. Signal temporal logic (STL) has emerged as a powerful formalism of expressing real-time constraints, with its semantics enabling quantitative assessment of system behavior. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning (RL) has become an important method for solving control synthesis problems in unknown environments. Recent studies incorporate STL-based reward functions into RL to automatically synthesize control policies. However, the automatically inferred rewards obtained by these methods represent the global assessment of a whole or partial path but do not accumulate the rewards of local changes accurately, so the sparse global rewards may lead to non-convergence and unstable training performances. In this paper, we propose an online reward generation method guided by the online causation monitoring of STL. Our approach continuously monitors system behavior against an STL specification at each control step, computing the quantitative distance toward satisfaction or violation and thereby producing rewards that reflect instantaneous state dynamics. Additionally, we provide a smooth approximation of the causation semantics to overcome the discontinuity of the causation semantics and make it differentiable for using deep-RL methods. We have implemented a prototype tool and evaluated it in the Gym environment on a variety of continuously controlled benchmarks. Experimental results show that our proposed STL-guided RL method with online causation semantics outperforms existing relevant STL-guided RL methods, providing a more robust and efficient reward generation framework for deep-RL.

<div> benchmarking, organic mechanism reasoning, large language models (LLMs), chemical reactivity, interdisciplinary research
Summary:
oMeBench is introduced as a large-scale benchmark for organic mechanism reasoning in organic chemistry, containing over 10,000 annotated mechanistic steps. The oMeS dynamic evaluation framework combines step-level logic and chemical similarity for precise evaluation of LLMs. State-of-the-art LLMs show promise in chemical intuition but struggle with correct multi-step reasoning. Using prompting strategy and fine-tuning a specialist model on oMeBench improves performance by 50%. This study aims to advance AI systems towards genuine chemical reasoning and emphasizes the importance of understanding organic reaction mechanisms for designing new molecules and reactions. <div>
arXiv:2510.07731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic reaction mechanisms are the stepwise elementary reactions by which reactants form intermediates and products, and are fundamental to understanding chemical reactivity and designing new molecules and reactions. Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding chemical tasks such as synthesis design, it is unclear to what extent this reflects genuine chemical reasoning capabilities, i.e., the ability to generate valid intermediates, maintain chemical consistency, and follow logically coherent multi-step pathways. We address this by introducing oMeBench, the first large-scale, expert-curated benchmark for organic mechanism reasoning in organic chemistry. It comprises over 10,000 annotated mechanistic steps with intermediates, type labels, and difficulty ratings. Furthermore, to evaluate LLM capability more precisely and enable fine-grained scoring, we propose oMeS, a dynamic evaluation framework that combines step-level logic and chemical similarity. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, and our results show that although current models display promising chemical intuition, they struggle with correct and consistent multi-step reasoning. Notably, we find that using prompting strategy and fine-tuning a specialist model on our proposed dataset increases performance by 50% over the leading closed-source model. We hope that oMeBench will serve as a rigorous foundation for advancing AI systems toward genuine chemical reasoning.

<div> agent framework, hierarchical citation graph, structured survey outline, multi-level summaries, research taxonomy <br />
Summary: 
The article introduces SurveyG, a novel agent framework that incorporates a hierarchical citation graph to enhance survey paper generation by considering structural relationships among papers. The graph consists of three layers: Foundation, Development, and Frontier, representing the evolution of research from foundational works to emerging directions. By combining horizontal search within layers and vertical depth traversal across layers, SurveyG produces multi-level summaries that are consolidated into a structured survey outline. A multi-agent validation stage ensures consistency, coverage, and factual accuracy in survey generation. Experiments show that SurveyG outperforms existing frameworks, producing surveys that are more comprehensive and better structured according to the underlying knowledge taxonomy of a field. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.07733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for automating survey paper generation \cite{wang2406autosurvey, liang2025surveyx, yan2025surveyforge,su2025benchmarking,wen2025interactivesurvey}. Existing approaches typically extract content from a large collection of related papers and prompt LLMs to summarize them directly. However, such methods often overlook the structural relationships among papers, resulting in generated surveys that lack a coherent taxonomy and a deeper contextual understanding of research progress. To address these shortcomings, we propose \textbf{SurveyG}, an LLM-based agent framework that integrates \textit{hierarchical citation graph}, where nodes denote research papers and edges capture both citation dependencies and semantic relatedness between their contents, thereby embedding structural and contextual knowledge into the survey generation process. The graph is organized into three layers: \textbf{Foundation}, \textbf{Development}, and \textbf{Frontier}, to capture the evolution of research from seminal works to incremental advances and emerging directions. By combining horizontal search within layers and vertical depth traversal across layers, the agent produces multi-level summaries, which are consolidated into a structured survey outline. A multi-agent validation stage then ensures consistency, coverage, and factual accuracy in generating the final survey. Experiments, including evaluations by human experts and LLM-as-a-judge, demonstrate that SurveyG outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks, producing surveys that are more comprehensive and better structured to the underlying knowledge taxonomy of a field.

Summary: 
The "Haibu Mathematical-Medical Intelligent Agent" (MMIA) is introduced as a reliable architecture driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) for medical tasks. This system ensures accuracy through verifiable reasoning by breaking down tasks into evidence-based steps and auditing for logical coherence. MMIA's "bootstrapping" mode stores validated reasoning chains for efficient future tasks using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Validation across healthcare administration domains showed MMIA achieving a high error detection rate and low false positive rate. The RAG matching mode is expected to reduce processing costs significantly. MMIA's framework presents a promising step towards trustworthy and cost-effective AI systems, making LLM technology suitable for critical medical applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.07748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in medicine but are prone to factual and logical errors, which is unacceptable in this high-stakes field. To address this, we introduce the "Haibu Mathematical-Medical Intelligent Agent" (MMIA), an LLM-driven architecture that ensures reliability through a formally verifiable reasoning process. MMIA recursively breaks down complex medical tasks into atomic, evidence-based steps. This entire reasoning chain is then automatically audited for logical coherence and evidence traceability, similar to theorem proving. A key innovation is MMIA's "bootstrapping" mode, which stores validated reasoning chains as "theorems." Subsequent tasks can then be efficiently solved using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), shifting from costly first-principles reasoning to a low-cost verification model. We validated MMIA across four healthcare administration domains, including DRG/DIP audits and medical insurance adjudication, using expert-validated benchmarks. Results showed MMIA achieved an error detection rate exceeding 98% with a false positive rate below 1%, significantly outperforming baseline LLMs. Furthermore, the RAG matching mode is projected to reduce average processing costs by approximately 85% as the knowledge base matures. In conclusion, MMIA's verifiable reasoning framework is a significant step toward creating trustworthy, transparent, and cost-effective AI systems, making LLM technology viable for critical applications in medicine.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel framework for Test-Time Graph Domain Adaptation (TT-GDA) that leverages large language models (LLMs) to address the domain shift between train and test data. The framework reframes TT-GDA as a generative graph restoration problem, aiming to restore the target graph to its source-domain-like state without accessing the source examples. The key challenges include designing an effective encoding scheme for LLMs and ensuring the restored graph acquires the intrinsic features of the source domain. The proposed approach, GRAIL, compresses node representations, uses a graph diffusion process for restoration, and employs a quantization module to encode features into discrete tokens. An LLM is fine-tuned as a generative restorer guided by reinforcement learning to improve restoration quality. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the approach across various datasets.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.07762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph domain adaptation (GDA) has achieved great attention due to its effectiveness in addressing the domain shift between train and test data. A significant bottleneck in existing graph domain adaptation methods is their reliance on source-domain data, which is often unavailable due to privacy or security concerns. This limitation has driven the development of Test-Time Graph Domain Adaptation (TT-GDA), which aims to transfer knowledge without accessing the source examples. Inspired by the generative power of large language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework that reframes TT-GDA as a generative graph restoration problem, "restoring the target graph to its pristine, source-domain-like state". There are two key challenges: (1) We need to construct a reasonable graph restoration process and design an effective encoding scheme that an LLM can understand, bridging the modality gap. (2) We need to devise a mechanism to ensure the restored graph acquires the intrinsic features of the source domain, even without access to the source data. To ensure the effectiveness of graph restoration, we propose GRAIL, that restores the target graph into a state that is well-aligned with the source domain. Specifically, we first compress the node representations into compact latent features and then use a graph diffusion process to model the graph restoration process. Then a quantization module encodes the restored features into discrete tokens. Building on this, an LLM is fine-tuned as a generative restorer to transform a "noisy" target graph into a "native" one. To further improve restoration quality, we introduce a reinforcement learning process guided by specialized alignment and confidence rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across various datasets.

Summary:<br />
This study introduces a novel decomposition framework called Analysis of CONstraint-Induced Complexity (ACONIC) to address reliability issues faced by Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex tasks. ACONIC models tasks as constraint problems and utilizes formal complexity measures to guide decomposition systematically. By applying this framework to combinatorial and database querying tasks, significant performance improvements of 10-40 percentage points were observed. This approach is a departure from heuristic methods and agent or manual decomposition commonly used in existing techniques. The systematic nature of ACONIC allows for more effective decomposition, enabling LLMs to perform better on challenging tasks such as SATBench and database querying. Overall, the incorporation of formal complexity measures in task decomposition offers a promising solution to enhancing the performance of LLMs on complex tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

This work introduces a novel, systematic decomposition framework that we call Analysis of CONstraint-Induced Complexity (ACONIC), which models the task as a constraint problem and leveraging formal complexity measures to guide decomposition. On combinatorial (SATBench) and LLM database querying tasks (Spider), we find that by decomposing the tasks following the measure of complexity, agent can perform considerably better (10-40 percentage point).

Summary: 
Group Contrastive Policy Optimization (GCPO) is introduced as a method to improve the reasoning capabilities of language models by incorporating external reference answers. Unlike existing algorithms like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), GCPO utilizes reference answers to guide model updates when faced with incorrect or unsolvable problems, leading to more efficient training. By emulating the problem-solving strategy of the reference answer during training, GCPO enhances generalization in reasoning tasks. The method achieves exceptional results on various benchmark datasets, surpassing baseline models. The code for GCPO implementation is available on GitHub, allowing for further research and application in reinforcement learning tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.07790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models. Extending the inference limits of smaller models has become a prominent research focus. However, algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffer from a clear drawback: the upper bound of a model's rollout responses is entirely determined by the model itself, preventing the acquisition of knowledge from samples that are either all incorrect or all correct. In this paper, we introduce Group Contrastive Policy Optimization (GCPO), a method that incorporates external standard reference answers. When the model cannot solve a problem, the reference answer supplies the correct response, steering the model toward an unequivocally accurate update direction. This approach offers two main advantages: (1) it improves training efficiency by fully utilizing every sample; (2) it enables the model to emulate the problem solving strategy of the reference answer during training, thereby enhancing generalization in reasoning. GCPO achieves outstanding results across multiple benchmark datasets, yielding substantial improvements over the baseline model. Our code is available at: https://github.com/AchoWu/GCPO.

Summary: 
In adversarial environments, agents must navigate the trade-off between acquiring information and exposing themselves to threats. The PursuitEvasion-Exposure-Concealment Game (PEEC) framework explores this tension, with a focus on strategic communication. The SHADOW framework integrates navigation control, communication actions, and opponent modeling for effective decision-making in the PEEC game. Empirical evaluations show that SHADOW outperforms competitive baselines, highlighting the importance of temporal sequence modeling and opponent modeling. The learned policies generalize well across varying communication risks and physical asymmetries between agents, demonstrating the robustness of the approach. <div>

Abstract: Adversarial environments require agents to navigate a key strategic trade-off: acquiring information enhances situational awareness, but may simultaneously expose them to threats. To investigate this tension, we formulate a PursuitEvasion-Exposure-Concealment Game (PEEC) in which a pursuer agent must decide when to communicate in order to obtain the evader's position. Each communication reveals the pursuer's location, increasing the risk of being targeted. Both agents learn their movement policies via reinforcement learning, while the pursuer additionally learns a communication policy that balances observability and risk. We propose SHADOW (Strategic-communication Hybrid Action Decision-making under partial Observation for Warfare), a multi-headed sequential reinforcement learning framework that integrates continuous navigation control, discrete communication actions, and opponent modeling for behavior prediction. Empirical evaluations show that SHADOW pursuers achieve higher success rates than six competitive baselines. Our ablation study confirms that temporal sequence modeling and opponent modeling are critical for effective decision-making. Finally, our sensitivity analysis reveals that the learned policies generalize well across varying communication risks and physical asymmetries between agents.

Summary: CityNav proposes a hierarchical framework for large-scale multi-vehicle navigation in urban environments. It integrates a global traffic allocation agent and local navigation agents to coordinate strategic traffic flow distribution across regions and generate locally adaptive routes aligned with global directives. The framework includes a cooperative reasoning optimization mechanism and uses a dual-reward structure to promote individual vehicle efficiency and network-wide coordination. Extensive experiments on real-world road networks demonstrate that CityNav outperforms classical path search and reinforcement learning-based baselines in travel efficiency and congestion reduction. The results showcase the potential of large language models (LLMs) in enabling scalable, adaptive, and cooperative city-wide traffic navigation, laying the groundwork for intelligent vehicle routing in complex urban settings.

Abstract: The rise of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technologies is transforming traffic management from isolated control to a collective, multi-vehicle process. At the heart of this shift is multi-vehicle dynamic navigation, which requires simultaneously routing large fleets under evolving traffic conditions. Existing path search algorithms and reinforcement learning methods struggle to scale to city-wide networks, often failing to capture the nonlinear, stochastic, and coupled dynamics of urban traffic. To address these challenges, we propose CityNav, a hierarchical, LLM-powered framework for large-scale multi-vehicle navigation. CityNav integrates a global traffic allocation agent, which coordinates strategic traffic flow distribution across regions, with local navigation agents that generate locally adaptive routes aligned with global directives. To enable effective cooperation, we introduce a cooperative reasoning optimization mechanism, in which agents are jointly trained with a dual-reward structure: individual rewards promote per-vehicle efficiency, while shared rewards encourage network-wide coordination and congestion reduction. Extensive experiments on four real-world road networks of varying scales (up to 1.6 million roads and 430,000 intersections) and traffic datasets demonstrate that CityNav consistently outperforms nine classical path search and RL-based baselines in city-scale travel efficiency and congestion mitigation. Our results highlight the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, adaptive, and cooperative city-wide traffic navigation, providing a foundation for intelligent, large-scale vehicle routing in complex urban environments.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made substantial progress in recent years. However, their rigorous evaluation within specialized domains like finance is hindered by the absence of datasets characterized by professional-level knowledge intensity, detailed annotations, and advanced reasoning complexity. To address this critical gap, we introduce FinMR, a high-quality, knowledge-intensive multimodal dataset explicitly designed to evaluate expert-level financial reasoning capabilities at a professional analyst's standard. FinMR comprises over 3,200 meticulously curated and expertly annotated question-answer pairs across 15 diverse financial topics, ensuring broad domain diversity and integrating sophisticated mathematical reasoning, advanced financial knowledge, and nuanced visual interpretation tasks across multiple image types. Through comprehensive benchmarking with leading closed-source and open-source MLLMs, we highlight significant performance disparities between these models and professional financial analysts, uncovering key areas for model advancement, such as precise image analysis, accurate application of complex financial formulas, and deeper contextual financial understanding. By providing richly varied visual content and thorough explanatory annotations, FinMR establishes itself as an essential benchmark tool for assessing and advancing multimodal financial reasoning toward professional analyst-level competence.

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have emerged as a promising avenue for time series forecasting, offering the potential to integrate multimodal data. However, existing LLM-based approaches face notable limitations-such as marginalized role in model architectures, reliance on coarse statistical text prompts, and lack of interpretability. In this work, we introduce Augur, a fully LLM driven time series forecasting framework that exploits LLM causal reasoning to discover and use directed causal associations among covariates. Augur uses a two stage teacher student architecture where a powerful teacher LLM infers a directed causal graph from time series using heuristic search together with pairwise causality testing. A lightweight student agent then refines the graph and fine tune on high confidence causal associations that are encoded as rich textual prompts to perform forecasting. This design improves predictive accuracy while yielding transparent, traceable reasoning about variable interactions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets with 25 baselines demonstrate that Augur achieves competitive performance and robust zero-shot generalization.

DeepResearch agents are AI systems that conduct expert-level research through sophisticated reasoning and multi-tool integration. Evaluating these systems is challenging due to open-ended research scenarios and the need for holistic performance assessment. Traditional benchmarks focus on isolated capabilities rather than overall system performance. To address this gap, the DeepResearch-ReportEval framework assesses DeepResearch systems through their outputs: research reports. It measures quality, redundancy, and factuality using an innovative LLM-as-a-Judge methodology. A benchmark of 100 curated queries across 12 categories enables systematic comparison. Evaluation of four commercial systems reveals distinct design philosophies and performance trade-offs, offering foundational insights as DeepResearch evolves.

Abstract: DeepResearch agents represent a transformative AI paradigm, conducting expert-level research through sophisticated reasoning and multi-tool integration. However, evaluating these systems remains critically challenging due to open-ended research scenarios and existing benchmarks that focus on isolated capabilities rather than holistic performance. Unlike traditional LLM tasks, DeepResearch systems must synthesize diverse sources, generate insights, and present coherent findings, which are capabilities that resist simple verification. To address this gap, we introduce DeepResearch-ReportEval, a comprehensive framework designed to assess DeepResearch systems through their most representative outputs: research reports. Our approach systematically measures three dimensions: quality, redundancy, and factuality, using an innovative LLM-as-a-Judge methodology achieving strong expert concordance. We contribute a standardized benchmark of 100 curated queries spanning 12 real-world categories, enabling systematic capability comparison. Our evaluation of four leading commercial systems reveals distinct design philosophies and performance trade-offs, establishing foundational insights as DeepResearch evolves from information assistants toward intelligent research partners.

Summary: 
Artificial intelligence is increasingly being used in governmental services, but often produces biased or incorrect outcomes, limiting citizens' agency. Current transparency practices focus on technical aspects of AI decision-making, making it difficult for the public to understand and act upon. This paper proposes the concept of meaningful transparency for civic AI systems, which allows for public engagement and understanding of AI systems that impact their lives. By taking a human-centric view on transparency and incorporating a socio-technical systems perspective, meaningful transparency can connect understanding to actionable insights for citizens. <div>
arXiv:2510.07889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence has become a part of the provision of governmental services, from making decisions about benefits to issuing fines for parking violations. However, AI systems rarely live up to the promise of neutral optimisation, creating biased or incorrect outputs and reducing the agency of both citizens and civic workers to shape the way decisions are made. Transparency is a principle that can both help subjects understand decisions made about them and shape the processes behind those decisions. However, transparency as practiced around AI systems tends to focus on the production of technical objects that represent algorithmic aspects of decision making. These are often difficult for publics to understand, do not connect to potential for action, and do not give insight into the wider socio-material context of decision making. In this paper, we build on existing approaches that take a human-centric view on AI transparency, combined with a socio-technical systems view, to develop the concept of meaningful transparency for civic AI systems: transparencies that allow publics to engage with AI systems that affect their lives, connecting understanding with potential for action.

Summary: <br />
This paper addresses the issue of information leakage in LLM-based financial agents, which often leads to inflated back-tested returns that do not hold up in real-time trading. The authors introduce a new evaluation benchmark called FinLake-Bench to quantify this leakage problem across four dimensions. To mitigate the issue, they propose FactFin, a framework that leverages counterfactual perturbations to encourage LLM-based agents to focus on learning causal drivers rather than memorized outcomes. FactFin consists of four core components: Strategy Code Generator, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Monte Carlo Tree Search, and Counterfactual Simulator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FactFin outperforms all baselines in out-of-sample generalization, delivering superior risk-adjusted performance. <div>

Abstract: LLM-based financial agents have attracted widespread excitement for their ability to trade like human experts. However, most systems exhibit a "profit mirage": dazzling back-tested returns evaporate once the model's knowledge window ends, because of the inherent information leakage in LLMs. In this paper, we systematically quantify this leakage issue across four dimensions and release FinLake-Bench, a leakage-robust evaluation benchmark. Furthermore, to mitigate this issue, we introduce FactFin, a framework that applies counterfactual perturbations to compel LLM-based agents to learn causal drivers instead of memorized outcomes. FactFin integrates four core components: Strategy Code Generator, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Monte Carlo Tree Search, and Counterfactual Simulator. Extensive experiments show that our method surpasses all baselines in out-of-sample generalization, delivering superior risk-adjusted performance.

Summary: 
The article discusses the limitations of current approaches for delivering personalized interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs) and proposes a framework for integrating user-specific data to enhance personalization. By combining contextual information with persistent memory, dynamic coordination, self-validation, and evolving user profiles, the framework aims to enable personalized long-term interactions with LLM-based agents. The authors evaluate their approach using metrics such as retrieval accuracy and response correctness, as well as a pilot user study to gather initial feedback on perceived personalization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as the central control unit of AI agents, yet current approaches remain limited in their ability to deliver personalized interactions. While Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances LLM capabilities by improving context-awareness, it lacks mechanisms to combine contextual information with user-specific data. Although personalization has been studied in fields such as human-computer interaction or cognitive science, existing perspectives largely remain conceptual, with limited focus on technical implementation. To address these gaps, we build on a unified definition of personalization as a conceptual foundation to derive technical requirements for adaptive, user-centered LLM-based agents. Combined with established agentic AI patterns such as multi-agent collaboration or multi-source retrieval, we present a framework that integrates persistent memory, dynamic coordination, self-validation, and evolving user profiles to enable personalized long-term interactions. We evaluate our approach on three public datasets using metrics such as retrieval accuracy, response correctness, or BertScore. We complement these results with a five-day pilot user study providing initial insights into user feedback on perceived personalization. The study provides early indications that guide future work and highlights the potential of integrating persistent memory and user profiles to improve the adaptivity and perceived personalization of LLM-based agents.

<div> relevance analysis, e-commerce search engines, large language models, reinforcement learning, interpretability, robustness<br />
Summary:<br />
Query-product relevance analysis in e-commerce search engines is vital and evolving with the rise of large language models. Existing training paradigms have limitations in generalization, fine-grained supervision, and sparse feedback. A new approach, TaoSR-SHE, introduces Stepwise Reward Policy Optimization (SRPO) to leverage step-level rewards and improve reasoning quality. It combines a generative reward model and human verification to prioritize critical reasoning steps. TaoSR-SHE also utilizes diversified data filtering for exploration and multi-stage curriculum learning for progressive learning. Extensive experiments show its superiority over existing methods in reasoning quality and relevance prediction accuracy, enhancing interpretability and robustness in large-scale e-commerce contexts. <div>
arXiv:2510.07972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Query-product relevance analysis is a foundational technology in e-commerce search engines and has become increasingly important in AI-driven e-commerce. The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs), particularly their chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities, offers promising opportunities for developing relevance systems that are both more interpretable and more robust. However, existing training paradigms have notable limitations: SFT and DPO suffer from poor generalization on long-tail queries and from a lack of fine-grained, stepwise supervision to enforce rule-aligned reasoning. In contrast, reinforcement learning with verification rewards (RLVR) suffers from sparse feedback, which provides insufficient signal to correct erroneous intermediate steps, thereby undermining logical consistency and limiting performance in complex inference scenarios.
  To address these challenges, we introduce the Stepwise Hybrid Examination Reinforcement Learning framework for Taobao Search Relevance (TaoSR-SHE). At its core is Stepwise Reward Policy Optimization (SRPO), a reinforcement learning algorithm that leverages step-level rewards generated by a hybrid of a high-quality generative stepwise reward model and a human-annotated offline verifier, prioritizing learning from critical correct and incorrect reasoning steps. TaoSR-SHE further incorporates two key techniques: diversified data filtering to encourage exploration across varied reasoning paths and mitigate policy entropy collapse, and multi-stage curriculum learning to foster progressive capability growth. Extensive experiments on real-world search benchmarks show that TaoSR-SHE improves both reasoning quality and relevance-prediction accuracy in large-scale e-commerce settings, outperforming SFT, DPO, GRPO, and other baselines, while also enhancing interpretability and robustness.

Abstract: Large-scale Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) have enabled voice assistants capable of understanding natural spoken queries and performing complex tasks. However, existing speech benchmarks primarily focus on isolated capabilities such as transcription, or question-answering, and do not systematically evaluate agentic scenarios encompassing multilingual and cultural understanding, as well as adversarial robustness. To address this, we introduce VoiceAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate SpeechLMs in realistic spoken agentic settings. It comprises over 5,500 synthetic spoken queries, including dialogues grounded in Indian context, covering single-tool invocations, multi-tool workflows, multi-turn interactions, and safety evaluations. The benchmark supports English, Hindi, and 5 other Indian languages, reflecting real-world linguistic and cultural diversity. We simulate speaker variability using a novel sampling algorithm that selects audios for TTS voice conversion based on its speaker embeddings, maximizing acoustic and speaker diversity. Our evaluation measures tool selection accuracy, structural consistency, and the correctness of tool invocations, including adversarial robustness. Our experiments reveal significant gaps in contextual tool orchestration tasks, Indic generalization, and adversarial robustness, exposing critical limitations of current SpeechLMs.

<div> Keywords: Mobile GUI agents, human-in-the-loop, context-aware, multi-agent framework, information management<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces ReInAgent, a context-aware multi-agent framework designed to improve mobile task navigation by incorporating human input during task execution. Existing mobile GUI agents often operate autonomously, leading to outcomes that may not align with user preferences. ReInAgent overcomes this limitation by integrating specialized agents for information management, decision-making, and task reflection, all collaborating through a shared memory module. By continuously analyzing contextual information and facilitating user-agent interaction, ReInAgent adapts to dynamic and ambiguous task scenarios, resulting in more reliable outcomes. Experimental results show that ReInAgent outperforms existing approaches, achieving a 25% higher success rate on complex tasks involving information dilemmas. This framework demonstrates the potential for improved adaptability and user satisfaction in mobile task execution.<br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.07988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile GUI agents exhibit substantial potential to facilitate and automate the execution of user tasks on mobile phones. However, exist mobile GUI agents predominantly privilege autonomous operation and neglect the necessity of active user engagement during task execution. This omission undermines their adaptability to information dilemmas including ambiguous, dynamically evolving, and conflicting task scenarios, leading to execution outcomes that deviate from genuine user requirements and preferences. To address these shortcomings, we propose ReInAgent, a context-aware multi-agent framework that leverages dynamic information management to enable human-in-the-loop mobile task navigation. ReInAgent integrates three specialized agents around a shared memory module: an information-managing agent for slot-based information management and proactive interaction with the user, a decision-making agent for conflict-aware planning, and a reflecting agent for task reflection and information consistency validation. Through continuous contextual information analysis and sustained user-agent collaboration, ReInAgent overcomes the limitation of existing approaches that rely on clear and static task assumptions. Consequently, it enables more adaptive and reliable mobile task navigation in complex, real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ReInAgent effectively resolves information dilemmas and produces outcomes that are more closely aligned with genuine user preferences. Notably, on complex tasks involving information dilemmas, ReInAgent achieves a 25% higher success rate than Mobile-Agent-v2.

Summary: 
The research evaluates how language models handle integers and numeric representations, finding that models do not treat numeric spaces as continuous and introduce significant noise. While models can accurately reconstruct values, principal components only explain a small portion of the variation in the embedding space, indicating the presence of orthogonal components. The study shows that as the decimal precision increases, both linear reconstruction and explained variance deteriorate, highlighting potential issues in areas where embedding models are used, especially for tasks requiring high numerical precision or involving large magnitudes and mixed-sign values. <div>
arXiv:2510.08009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has extensively studied how large language models manipulate integers in specific arithmetic tasks, and on a more fundamental level, how they represent numeric values. These previous works have found that language model embeddings can be used to reconstruct the original values, however, they do not evaluate whether language models actually model continuous values as continuous. Using expected properties of the embedding space, including linear reconstruction and principal component analysis, we show that language models not only represent numeric spaces as non-continuous but also introduce significant noise. Using models from three major providers (OpenAI, Google Gemini and Voyage AI), we show that while reconstruction is possible with high fidelity ($R^2 \geq 0.95$), principal components only explain a minor share of variation within the embedding space. This indicates that many components within the embedding space are orthogonal to the simple numeric input space. Further, both linear reconstruction and explained variance suffer with increasing decimal precision, despite the ordinal nature of the input space being fundamentally unchanged. The findings of this work therefore have implications for the many areas where embedding models are used, in-particular where high numerical precision, large magnitudes or mixed-sign values are common.

<div> Keyword: Large Reasoning Models, Entropy, Phase Entropy Aware Reward, Response Length, Performance

Summary:
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often generate long and redundant explanations due to high entropy in the thinking phase. To address this, Phase Entropy Aware Reward (PEAR) penalizes excessive entropy during the thinking phase while allowing moderate exploration for the final answer, leading to concise and accurate reasoning traces. This approach enables adaptive control of response length without predefined targets or rigid rules. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PEAR effectively reduces response length while maintaining competitive accuracy, even exhibiting strong out-of-distribution robustness. The code for PEAR is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks by generating detailed chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations. However, these responses are often excessively long, containing redundant reasoning steps that inflate inference cost and reduce usability. Controlling the length of generated reasoning without sacrificing accuracy remains an open challenge. Through a systematic empirical analysis, we reveal a consistent positive correlation between model entropy and response length at different reasoning stages across diverse LRMs: the thinking phase exhibits higher entropy, reflecting exploratory behavior of longer responses, while the final answer phase shows lower entropy, indicating a more deterministic solution.This observation suggests that entropy at different reasoning stages can serve as a control knob for balancing conciseness and performance. Based on this insight, this paper introduces Phase Entropy Aware Reward (PEAR), a reward mechanism that incorporating phase-dependent entropy into the reward design. Instead of treating all tokens uniformly, PEAR penalize excessive entropy during the thinking phase and allowing moderate exploration at the final answer phase, which encourages models to generate concise reasoning traces that retain sufficient flexibility to solve the task correctly. This enables adaptive control of response length without relying on explicit length targets or rigid truncation rules. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that PEAR consistently reduces response length while sustaining competitive accuracy across model scales. In addition, PEAR demonstrates strong out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness beyond the training distribution. Our code is available at: https://github.com/iNLP-Lab/PEAR.

<div> parameter-efficient, finetuning, Low-Rank Adaptation, AILoRA, self-attention <br />
Summary: 
The article introduces AILoRA, a novel parameter-efficient finetuning method that incorporates function-aware asymmetric low-rank priors. It addresses limitations of the widely adopted Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approach by considering the distinct characteristics of the projection matrices $W^Q$ and $W^V in self-attention mechanisms. $W^Q captures task-specific semantic space knowledge, while $W^V encodes stable token-level feature representations. AILoRA leverages this insight to initialize LoRA modules asymmetrically, injecting principal components of $W^Q for task adaptation and minor components of $W^V for generalizable features. This strategy enhances finetuning performance and convergence efficiency by better capturing the specialized roles of attention parameters. AILoRA offers a promising solution to overcoming challenges faced by existing parameter-efficient finetuning approaches, improving model adaptation to diverse downstream tasks with reduced computational and memory overhead. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.08034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) aims to mitigate the substantial computational and memory overhead involved in adapting large-scale pretrained models to diverse downstream tasks. Among numerous PEFT strategies, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely adopted approaches due to its robust empirical performance and low implementation complexity. In practical deployment, LoRA is typically applied to the $W^Q$ and $W^V$ projection matrices of self-attention modules, enabling an effective trade-off between model performance and parameter efficiency. While LoRA has achieved considerable empirical success, it still encounters challenges such as suboptimal performance and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{AILoRA}, a novel parameter-efficient method that incorporates function-aware asymmetric low-rank priors. Our empirical analysis reveals that the projection matrices $W^Q$ and $W^V$ in the self-attention mechanism exhibit distinct parameter characteristics, stemming from their functional differences. Specifically, $W^Q$ captures task-specific semantic space knowledge essential for attention distributions computation, making its parameters highly sensitive to downstream task variations. In contrast, $W^V$ encodes token-level feature representations that tend to remain stable across tasks and layers. Leveraging these insights, AILoRA performs a function-aware initialization by injecting the principal components of $W^Q$ to retain task-adaptive capacity, and the minor components of $W^V$ to preserve generalizable feature representations. This asymmetric initialization strategy enables LoRA modules to better capture the specialized roles of attention parameters, thereby enhancing both finetuning performance and convergence efficiency.

The article introduces LinguaSim, a framework that converts natural language into realistic 3D scenarios for autonomous vehicle testing and training. Current methods struggle to balance accuracy and realism, often sacrificing realism for simplicity. LinguaSim aims to bridge this gap by creating interactive simulations that align closely with user descriptions, enhancing safety testing and training. The framework includes a feedback calibration module to refine scenario generation precision, improving fidelity to user intent. Experiments show LinguaSim can generate scenarios with varying criticality based on natural language descriptions and effectively reduce excessive aggressiveness in initial outputs. This results in a lower crash rate to better match user intentions. Overall, LinguaSim offers a promising approach to scenario generation for autonomous vehicles, combining natural language processing with interactive 3D simulations for more accurate and realistic testing environments.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of testing and training scenarios for autonomous vehicles has drawn significant attention. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled new scenario generation methods, current methods struggle to balance command adherence accuracy with the realism of real-world driving environments. To reduce scenario description complexity, these methods often compromise realism by limiting scenarios to 2D, or open-loop simulations where background vehicles follow predefined, non-interactive behaviors. We propose LinguaSim, an LLM-based framework that converts natural language into realistic, interactive 3D scenarios, ensuring both dynamic vehicle interactions and faithful alignment between the input descriptions and the generated scenarios. A feedback calibration module further refines the generation precision, improving fidelity to user intent. By bridging the gap between natural language and closed-loop, interactive simulations, LinguaSim constrains adversarial vehicle behaviors using both the scenario description and the autonomous driving model guiding them. This framework facilitates the creation of high-fidelity scenarios that enhance safety testing and training. Experiments show LinguaSim can generate scenarios with varying criticality aligned with different natural language descriptions (ACT: 0.072 s for dangerous vs. 3.532 s for safe descriptions; comfortability: 0.654 vs. 0.764), and its refinement module effectively reduces excessive aggressiveness in LinguaSim's initial outputs, lowering the crash rate from 46.9% to 6.3% to better match user intentions.

Summary: 
The article introduces the Multi-Condition Conformal Selection (MCCS) algorithm, which addresses the challenge of selecting high-quality candidates from large datasets with multiple conditions. Traditional conformal selection methods are limited to single-threshold scenarios, but MCCS extends this to include conjunctive and disjunctive conditions. The algorithm utilizes a novel nonconformity score for conjunctive conditions and a global Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for disjunctive conditions to ensure finite-sample False Discovery Rate control with theoretical guarantees. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of MCCS compared to baseline methods, its applicability across diverse conditions and real-world modalities, and its scalability to multi-task environments. The MCCS algorithm provides a robust solution for selecting high-quality candidates in resource-constrained applications such as drug discovery, precision medicine, and large language model alignment. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selecting high-quality candidates from large-scale datasets is critically important in resource-constrained applications such as drug discovery, precision medicine, and the alignment of large language models. While conformal selection methods offer a rigorous solution with False Discovery Rate (FDR) control, their applicability is confined to single-threshold scenarios (i.e., y > c) and overlooks practical needs for multi-condition selection, such as conjunctive or disjunctive conditions. In this work, we propose the Multi-Condition Conformal Selection (MCCS) algorithm, which extends conformal selection to scenarios with multiple conditions. In particular, we introduce a novel nonconformity score with regional monotonicity for conjunctive conditions and a global Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for disjunctive conditions, thereby establishing finite-sample FDR control with theoretical guarantees. The integration of these components enables the proposed method to achieve rigorous FDR-controlled selection in various multi-condition environments. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of MCCS over baselines, its generalizability across diverse condition combinations, different real-world modalities, and multi-task scalability.

AutoQual is a novel framework utilizing LLM-based agents to automatically extract interpretable features for ranking online reviews based on quality. Traditional methods are limited in scalability and adaptability, while deep learning approaches often lack interpretability. AutoQual mimics human research processes by generating feature hypotheses, operationalizing them, and accumulating knowledge in memory. Deployed on a large-scale online platform, it increased the average reviews viewed per user by 0.79% and the conversion rate of review readers by 0.27% through large-scale A/B testing. This framework aims to transform implicit data knowledge into explicit, computable features and can be applied across various domains beyond review quality assessment.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ranking online reviews by their intrinsic quality is a critical task for e-commerce platforms and information services, impacting user experience and business outcomes. However, quality is a domain-dependent and dynamic concept, making its assessment a formidable challenge. Traditional methods relying on hand-crafted features are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to evolving content patterns, while modern deep learning approaches often produce black-box models that lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over quality. To address these challenges, we propose AutoQual, an LLM-based agent framework that automates the discovery of interpretable features. While demonstrated on review quality assessment, AutoQual is designed as a general framework for transforming tacit knowledge embedded in data into explicit, computable features. It mimics a human research process, iteratively generating feature hypotheses through reflection, operationalizing them via autonomous tool implementation, and accumulating experience in a persistent memory. We deploy our method on a large-scale online platform with a billion-level user base. Large-scale A/B testing confirms its effectiveness, increasing average reviews viewed per user by 0.79% and the conversion rate of review readers by 0.27%.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for provably fair AI that overcomes the limits of current bias mitigation methods by systematically removing all sensitive information and its proxies. Using ontology engineering in OWL 2 QL, it formally defines sensitive attributes and infers their proxies through logical reasoning, constructing a sigma algebra G that captures the full structure of biased patterns. Fair representations are then obtained via Delbaen Majumdar optimal transport, which generates variables independent of G while minimizing L2 distance to preserve accuracy. This guarantees true independence rather than mere decorrelation. By modeling bias as dependence between sigma algebras, compiling ontological knowledge into measurable structures, and using optimal transport as the unique fair transformation, the approach ensures complete fairness in tasks like loan approval, where proxies such as ZIP code reveal race. The result is a certifiable and mathematically grounded method for trustworthy AI.

It specifically focuses on gender-specific attitudes, uncertainty, and role-based decision-making. The results show that while some LMs align with human behaviors, there are discrepancies that highlight the need for refining bio-centric measures of manipulability. The study suggests directions for improving AI design to enhance ethical decision-making and calls for advancements to ensure AI systems accurately replicate human risk preferences for better risk management. By refining AI design, the study aims to increase the applicability of AI assistants in risk management contexts. <div>

Abstract: Responsible AI demands systems whose behavioral tendencies can be effectively measured, audited, and adjusted to prevent inadvertently nudging users toward risky decisions or embedding hidden biases in risk aversion. As language models (LMs) are increasingly incorporated into AI-driven decision support systems, understanding their risk behaviors is crucial for their responsible deployment. This study investigates the manipulability of risk aversion (MoRA) in LMs, examining their ability to replicate human risk preferences across diverse economic scenarios, with a focus on gender-specific attitudes, uncertainty, role-based decision-making, and the manipulability of risk aversion. The results indicate that while LMs such as DeepSeek Reasoner and Gemini-2.0-flash-lite exhibit some alignment with human behaviors, notable discrepancies highlight the need to refine bio-centric measures of manipulability. These findings suggest directions for refining AI design to better align human and AI risk preferences and enhance ethical decision-making. The study calls for further advancements in model design to ensure that AI systems more accurately replicate human risk preferences, thereby improving their effectiveness in risk management contexts. This approach could enhance the applicability of AI assistants in managing risk.

<div> latency-quality tradeoff, open-domain dialogue AI systems, asynchronous knowledge orchestration, PMFR, Top-iOCQA <br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
In open-domain dialogue AI systems, the tradeoff between response latency and quality is a critical challenge. Existing approaches fall short in balancing comprehensive knowledge access and quick response times. A new system called PMFR addresses this issue by using asynchronous knowledge orchestration. It consists of a Knowledge Adequacy Evaluator for real-time assessment, a Lightweight Response Generator for immediate interaction, and an Asynchronous Knowledge Refinement Agent for background knowledge enrichment. PMFR demonstrated superior performance on Top-iOCQA by reducing latency by 95.3% while maintaining response quality comparable to synchronous baselines. This innovative architecture ensures continuous conversational flow while gradually enhancing knowledge coverage through intelligent triggering mechanisms. <div>

Abstract: The latency-quality tradeoff is a fundamental constraint in open-domain dialogue AI systems, since comprehensive knowledge access necessitates prohibitive response delays. Contemporary approaches offer two inadequate solutions: lightweight instruct models achieve sub-second latency but lack reasoning depth, while tool-augmented ReAct agents enhance factuality through external knowledge at the cost of synchronous execution that blocks interaction during re- trieval processes. PMFR is thus proposed, with a tempo- ral decoupling framework that fundamentally resolves the contradiction through asynchronous knowledge orchestra- tion. PMFR employs three coordinated components: (1) a Knowledge Adequacy Evaluator for real-time sufficiency assessment, (2) a Lightweight Response Generator for imme- diate user interaction, and (3) an Asynchronous Knowledge Refinement Agent for background knowledge enhancement. This architecture maintains continuous conversational flow while progressively enriching knowledge coverage through intelligent triggering mechanisms. Evaluation results on Top- iOCQA demonstrate PMFR outperforms brute-force scaling: PMFR achieves 95.3% latency reduction (23.38s -> 1.09s) while preserving response quality comparable to heavyweight synchronous baselines (GEval-C: 0.613 vs. 0.620).

Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1, DeepSeek-R1) have led to remarkable improvements through long Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon tasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond to complex, long-horizon scenarios. To address this incomplete evaluation of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose R-HORIZON, a method designed to stimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition. Based on R-HORIZON, we construct a long-horizon reasoning benchmark, comprising complex multi-step reasoning tasks with interdependent problems that span long reasoning horizons. Through comprehensive evaluation of LRMs using the R-HORIZON benchmark, we find that even the most advanced LRMs suffer significant performance degradation. Our analysis reveals that LRMs exhibit limited effective reasoning length and struggle to allocate thinking budget across multiple problems appropriately. Recognizing these limitations, we use R-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning with verified rewards (RLVR). Compared to training with single-horizon data, RLVR with R-HORIZON not only substantially improves performance on the multi-horizon reasoning tasks, but also promotes accuracy on standard reasoning tasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024. These results position R-HORIZON as a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for enhancing and evaluating the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.

<div> Artificial Intelligence, Governance, Pluralism, Index, Transparency
Summary: 
The article introduces the AI Pluralism Index (AIPI), a tool that evaluates AI systems based on participatory governance, inclusivity, transparency, and accountability. The index aims to measure the degree to which stakeholders can influence the objectives, data practices, safeguards, and deployment of AI systems. The AIPI utilizes verifiable practices from public artifacts and independent evaluations to provide transparent and evidence-based assessments. The index is designed to promote pluralistic governance in AI development and to enable policymakers, procurers, and the public to make informed decisions. The article outlines the measurement model, implementation process, and reliability assessment of the AIPI. It also presents pilot results of the index and discusses its positioning among existing transparency, safety, and governance frameworks. The ultimate goal of the AIPI is to incentivize pluralistic practices in the development and deployment of AI technologies. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems increasingly mediate knowledge, communication, and decision making. Development and governance remain concentrated within a small set of firms and states, raising concerns that technologies may encode narrow interests and limit public agency. Capability benchmarks for language, vision, and coding are common, yet public, auditable measures of pluralistic governance are rare. We define AI pluralism as the degree to which affected stakeholders can shape objectives, data practices, safeguards, and deployment. We present the AI Pluralism Index (AIPI), a transparent, evidence-based instrument that evaluates producers and system families across four pillars: participatory governance, inclusivity and diversity, transparency, and accountability. AIPI codes verifiable practices from public artifacts and independent evaluations, explicitly handling "Unknown" evidence to report both lower-bound ("evidence") and known-only scores with coverage. We formalize the measurement model; implement a reproducible pipeline that integrates structured web and repository analysis, external assessments, and expert interviews; and assess reliability with inter-rater agreement, coverage reporting, cross-index correlations, and sensitivity analysis. The protocol, codebook, scoring scripts, and evidence graph are maintained openly with versioned releases and a public adjudication process. We report pilot provider results and situate AIPI relative to adjacent transparency, safety, and governance frameworks. The index aims to steer incentives toward pluralistic practice and to equip policymakers, procurers, and the public with comparable evidence.

<title>The Tournament Tree Method for preference elicitation in Multi-criteria decision-making</title>

arXiv:2510.08197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pairwise comparison methods, such as Fuzzy Preference Relations and Saaty's Multiplicative Preference Relations, are widely used to model expert judgments in multi-criteria decision-making. However, their application is limited by the high cognitive load required to complete $m(m-1)/2$ comparisons, the risk of inconsistency, and the computational complexity of deriving consistent value scales. This paper proposes the Tournament Tree Method (TTM), a novel elicitation and evaluation framework that overcomes these limitations. The TTM requires only $m-1$ pairwise comparisons to obtain a complete, reciprocal, and consistent comparison matrix. The method consists of three phases: (i) elicitation of expert judgments using a reduced set of targeted comparisons, (ii) construction of the consistent pairwise comparison matrix, and (iii) derivation of a global value scale from the resulting matrix. The proposed approach ensures consistency by design, minimizes cognitive effort, and reduces the dimensionality of preference modeling from $m(m-1)/2$ to $m$ parameters. Furthermore, it is compatible with the classical Deck of Cards method, and thus it can handle interval and ratio scales. We have also developed a web-based tool that demonstrates its practical applicability in real decision-making scenarios.

<title>DODO: Causal Structure Learning with Budgeted Interventions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.08207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years, yet much of its progress relies on identifying increasingly complex correlations. Enabling causality awareness in AI has the potential to enhance its performance by enabling a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the environment. In this paper, we introduce DODO, an algorithm defining how an Agent can autonomously learn the causal structure of its environment through repeated interventions. We assume a scenario where an Agent interacts with a world governed by a causal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which dictates the system's dynamics but remains hidden from the Agent. The Agent's task is to accurately infer the causal DAG, even in the presence of noise. To achieve this, the Agent performs interventions, leveraging causal inference techniques to analyze the statistical significance of observed changes. Results show better performance for DODO, compared to observational approaches, in all but the most limited resource conditions. DODO is often able to reconstruct with as low as zero errors the structure of the causal graph. In the most challenging configuration, DODO outperforms the best baseline by +0.25 F1 points.

<title>Selection, Reflection and Self-Refinement: Revisit Reasoning Tasks via a Causal Lens</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08222</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.08222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their inherent complexity, reasoning tasks have long been regarded as rigorous benchmarks for assessing the capabilities of machine learning models, especially large language models (LLMs). Although humans can solve these tasks with ease, existing models, even after extensive pre-training and post-training at scale, still fail to perform reasoning reliably. In this paper, we revisit reasoning tasks from a causal perspective, seeking to understand their behavior in latent space and to offer insights for addressing their challenges. Specifically, we cast reasoning tasks as a selection mechanism, in which high-level logical concepts function as selection operators on the given observations, such as, identifying the correct answer in a math problem or filling the appropriate entry in Sudoku. We emphasize two key properties of this formulation that shed light on the difficulty of reasoning tasks. First, the latent space exceeds the observation space in complexity, even when the correct answer is fully determined by the observed input. Second, the latent variables, corresponding to logical thought, are densely structured and exhibit strong dependencies. Building on this formulation, we introduce a framework, called SR$^2$, that incorporates the estimated latent variables as feedback into the selection mechanism, thereby facilitating the learning of dense dependencies among latent representations. The framework consists of three key modules: reflective representation learning, dependency self-refinement, and periodic intermediate alignment. Experimentally, we show that our approach yields significant gains in reasoning accuracy, for example, attaining over 10$\%$ improvement in performance with 8$\times$ fewer parameters on the Sudoku and Maze tasks over the recent advances.

<title>Chain-of-Trigger: An Agentic Backdoor that Paradoxically Enhances Agentic Robustness</title>

Abstract: The rapid deployment of large language model (LLM)-based agents in real-world applications has raised serious concerns about their trustworthiness. In this work, we reveal the security and robustness vulnerabilities of these agents through backdoor attacks. Distinct from traditional backdoors limited to single-step control, we propose the Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri), a multi-step backdoor attack designed for long-horizon agentic control. CoTri relies on an ordered sequence. It starts with an initial trigger, and subsequent ones are drawn from the environment, allowing multi-step manipulation that diverts the agent from its intended task. Experimental results show that CoTri achieves a near-perfect attack success rate (ASR) while maintaining a near-zero false trigger rate (FTR). Due to training data modeling the stochastic nature of the environment, the implantation of CoTri paradoxically enhances the agent's performance on benign tasks and even improves its robustness against environmental distractions. We further validate CoTri on vision-language models (VLMs), confirming its scalability to multimodal agents. Our work highlights that CoTri achieves stable, multi-step control within agents, improving their inherent robustness and task capabilities, which ultimately makes the attack more stealthy and raises potential safty risks.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.08263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes Co-TAP (T: Triple, A: Agent, P: Protocol), a three-layer agent interaction protocol designed to address the challenges faced by multi-agent systems across the three core dimensions of Interoperability, Interaction and Collaboration, and Knowledge Sharing. We have designed and proposed a layered solution composed of three core protocols: the Human-Agent Interaction Protocol (HAI), the Unified Agent Protocol (UAP), and the Memory-Extraction-Knowledge Protocol (MEK). HAI focuses on the interaction layer, standardizing the flow of information between users, interfaces, and agents by defining a standardized, event-driven communication paradigm. This ensures the real-time performance, reliability, and synergy of interactions. As the core of the infrastructure layer, UAP is designed to break down communication barriers among heterogeneous agents through unified service discovery and protocol conversion mechanisms, thereby enabling seamless interconnection and interoperability of the underlying network. MEK, in turn, operates at the cognitive layer. By establishing a standardized ''Memory (M) - Extraction (E) - Knowledge (K)'' cognitive chain, it empowers agents with the ability to learn from individual experiences and form shareable knowledge, thereby laying the foundation for the realization of true collective intelligence. We believe this protocol framework will provide a solid engineering foundation and theoretical guidance for building the next generation of efficient, scalable, and intelligent multi-agent applications.

Abstract: Amortized optimization accelerates the solution of related optimization problems by learning mappings that exploit shared structure across problem instances. We explore the use of Scale Equivariant Graph Metanetworks (ScaleGMNs) for this purpose. By operating directly in weight space, ScaleGMNs enable single-shot fine-tuning of existing models, reducing the need for iterative optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach empirically and provide a theoretical result: the gauge freedom induced by scaling symmetries is strictly smaller in convolutional neural networks than in multi-layer perceptrons. This insight helps explain the performance differences observed between architectures in both our work and that of Kalogeropoulos et al. (2024). Overall, our findings underscore the potential of symmetry-aware metanetworks as a powerful approach for efficient and generalizable neural network optimization.

arXiv:2510.08308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated significant gains in reasoning ability, often attributed to their capacity to generate longer chains of thought and engage in reflective reasoning. However, the contribution of reflections to performance improvement remains unclear. In this paper, we systematically analyze the rollouts of eight reasoning models on five mathematical datasets. We focus on reflective behaviours where the model has already produced an answer but continues reflecting before finalizing its output. Our analysis reveals that reflections are predominantly confirmatory and rarely alter the model's initial answer, a pattern consistent across models and datasets. To understand the role of reflections in training, we construct supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets with varying amounts of reflection steps. We observe that training models on rollouts with more reflection steps primarily enhances first-answer correctness rather than the ability to correct initially wrong answers through reflections. This motivates us to propose a question-aware early-stopping method that enhances inference-time token efficiency by stopping the reasoning process once a few plausible candidate answers are generated, thereby reducing unnecessary reflection steps. Motivated by this, we further propose to dynamically truncate the reflections after a candidate answer has appeared during generation, which reduces reasoning tokens by 24.5% across five mathematical datasets, within a 2.9% drop in accuracy.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to improve Large Language Models on reasoning tasks such as coding, math or logic. To assess the reasoning boundary (the fraction of problems a model can solve) researchers often report Pass@k at large sampling budgets. Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models outperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms them when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been interpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We argue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric outputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success in the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can therefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of problems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of completions are correct. Unlike Pass@k, Cover@tau captures reasoning under an explicit reliability threshold: models that rely on random guessing degrade rapidly as tau increases. We evaluate several RLVR models using Cover@tau-based metrics and illustrate how the relative rankings of popular algorithms change compared to Pass@1, offering a different perspective on reasoning boundaries.

Abstract: Consumer research costs companies billions annually yet suffers from panel biases and limited scale. Large language models (LLMs) offer an alternative by simulating synthetic consumers, but produce unrealistic response distributions when asked directly for numerical ratings. We present semantic similarity rating (SSR), a method that elicits textual responses from LLMs and maps these to Likert distributions using embedding similarity to reference statements. Testing on an extensive dataset comprising 57 personal care product surveys conducted by a leading corporation in that market (9,300 human responses), SSR achieves 90% of human test-retest reliability while maintaining realistic response distributions (KS similarity > 0.85). Additionally, these synthetic respondents provide rich qualitative feedback explaining their ratings. This framework enables scalable consumer research simulations while preserving traditional survey metrics and interpretability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language tasks but are limited by their static parametric knowledge, especially in knowledge-intensive task. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating external information. However, (1) traditional RAG struggles with complex query understanding, and (2) even search agents trained with reinforcement learning (RL), despite their promise, still face generalization and deployment challenges. To address these limitations, we propose QAgent, a unified agentic RAG framework that employs a search agent for adaptive retrieval. This agent optimizes its understanding of the query through interactive reasoning and retrieval. To facilitate real-world application, we focus on modular search agent for query understanding that are plug-and-play in complex systems. Secifically, the agent follows a multi-step decision process trained with RL to maximize retrieval quality and support accurate downstream answers. We further analyze the strengths and weaknesses of end-to-end RL and propose a strategy that focuses on effective retrieval, thereby enhancing generalization in LLM applications. Experiments show QAgent excels at QA and serves as a plug-and-play module for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) remains a fundamental challenge for their trustworthy deployment. Going beyond basic uncertainty-driven hallucination detection frameworks, we propose a simple yet powerful method that quantifies uncertainty by measuring the effective rank of hidden states derived from multiple model outputs and different layers. Grounded in the spectral analysis of representations, our approach provides interpretable insights into the model's internal reasoning process through semantic variations, while requiring no extra knowledge or additional modules, thus offering a combination of theoretical elegance and practical efficiency. Meanwhile, we theoretically demonstrate the necessity of quantifying uncertainty both internally (representations of a single response) and externally (different responses), providing a justification for using representations among different layers and responses from LLMs to detect hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively detects hallucinations and generalizes robustly across various scenarios, contributing to a new paradigm of hallucination detection for LLM truthfulness.

Abstract: Training vision-language models on cognitively-plausible amounts of data requires rethinking how models integrate multimodal information. Within the constraints of the Vision track for the BabyLM Challenge 2025, we propose a lightweight decoder-based architecture with (1) token-wise dynamic gating for adaptive fusion of linguistic and visual cues, (2) feature modulation and channel attention to maximise the utility of limited visual information and (3) auxiliary contrastive objectives for visual grounding. Evaluation on five benchmarks (BLiMP, BLiMP Supplement, EWoK, Winoground and VQA) shows competitive or superior performance to multimodal baselines. More notably, our dynamic gate discovers interpretable patterns without explicit supervision, favouring visual cues for content words and linguistic cues for function words. While we identify limitations in the Challenge constraints, such as the information bottleneck created by global image embeddings and training instability from the dataset split, our findings establish dynamic gating as a powerful tool for efficient multimodal learning, offering both interpretability and performance even under severe constraints.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in general programming tasks. However, in Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) scenarios such as AutoML and Kaggle competitions, achieving high performance depends heavily on expert intervention and repeated adjustments rather than simply generating correct code. When applied directly to these tasks, LLMs often lack fine-grained domain priors, and existing MLE approaches that use linear or tree-structured searches limit knowledge transfer to adjacent hierarchical links. As a result, they cannot leverage past full trajectories or share information across branches, limiting self-evolving ability and search space diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoMLGen, an LLM-based coding agent that integrates a domain knowledge base for high-quality prior guidance and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. MCGS retains the tree-guided exploration of MCTS while embedding a graph structure into the expansion stage to enable dynamic path reorganization, historical trajectory reuse, and multi-solution fusion to support both self-evolution and collaborative learning. Combined with fine-grained operator sets, this design improves stability and accelerates convergence. Evaluation on the MLE-Bench shows that AutoMLGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in numerous dimensions, such as the average medal rate and the valid submission rate, under a 12-hour budget (half the standard runtime). The code is available at https://github.com/Alpha-Innovator/InternAgent.

<title>CaRT: Teaching LLM Agents to Know When They Know Enough</title>

Abstract: Many tasks require learned models to strategically gather relevant information over multiple rounds of interaction before actually acting on a task. Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to effectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information and make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when acting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals and Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to stop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT fine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where termination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same trajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the termination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this capability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two domains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both domains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and task success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Deep research is an inherently challenging task that demands both breadth and depth of thinking. It involves navigating diverse knowledge spaces and reasoning over complex, multi-step dependencies, which presents substantial challenges for agentic systems. To address this, we propose FlowSearch, a multi-agent framework that actively constructs and evolves a dynamic structured knowledge flow to drive subtask execution and reasoning. FlowSearch is capable of strategically planning and expanding the knowledge flow to enable parallel exploration and hierarchical task decomposition, while also adjusting the knowledge flow in real time based on feedback from intermediate reasoning outcomes and insights. FlowSearch achieves state-of-the-art performance on both general and scientific benchmarks, including GAIA, HLE, GPQA and TRQA, demonstrating its effectiveness in multi-disciplinary research scenarios and its potential to advance scientific discovery.

<title>Agent Learning via Early Experience</title>

Abstract: A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own experience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks. However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards (e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.

Abstract: How can we teach large multimodal models (LMMs) new skills without erasing prior abilities? We study sequential fine-tuning on five target skills while monitoring general ability on eight held-out benchmarks across three model families. We observe that apparent "forgetting" on held-out tasks after narrow fine-tuning can partly recover at later stages. We trace this behavior to a measurable shift in the output token distribution, manifested through a simple counting-bias probe that co-varies with forgetting. Guided by this picture, we identify two simple, robust tuning recipes that learn strongly while limiting drift: (i) updating only the self-attention projection layers, and (ii) updating only the MLP Gate&amp;Up while freezing the Down projection. Across models and tasks, these choices deliver strong target gains while largely preserving held-out performance. Code is available at https://github.com/jessemelpolio/LMM_CL

<title>DUA-D2C: Dynamic Uncertainty Aware Method for Overfitting Remediation in Deep Learning</title>

Abstract: Overfitting remains a significant challenge in deep learning, often arising from data outliers, noise, and limited training data. To address this, the Divide2Conquer (D2C) method was previously proposed, which partitions training data into multiple subsets and trains identical models independently on each. This strategy enables learning more consistent patterns while minimizing the influence of individual outliers and noise. However, D2C's standard aggregation typically treats all subset models equally or based on fixed heuristics (like data size), potentially underutilizing information about their varying generalization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, we introduce Dynamic Uncertainty-Aware Divide2Conquer (DUA-D2C), an advanced technique that refines the aggregation process. DUA-D2C dynamically weights the contributions of subset models based on their performance on a shared validation set, considering both accuracy and prediction uncertainty. This intelligent aggregation allows the central model to preferentially learn from subsets yielding more generalizable and confident edge models, thereby more effectively combating overfitting. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets spanning multiple domains demonstrate that DUA-D2C significantly improves generalization. Our analysis includes evaluations of decision boundaries, loss curves, and other performance metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of DUA-D2C. This study demonstrates that DUA-D2C improves generalization performance even when applied on top of other regularization methods, establishing it as a theoretically grounded and effective approach to combating overfitting in modern deep learning.

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder significantly influences the communication abilities, learning processes, behavior, and social interactions of individuals. Although early intervention and customized educational strategies are critical to improving outcomes, there is a pivotal gap in understanding and addressing nuanced behavioral patterns and emotional identification in autistic children prior to skill development. This extended research delves into the foundational step of recognizing and mapping these patterns as a prerequisite to improving learning and soft skills. Using a longitudinal approach to monitor emotions and behaviors, this study aims to establish a baseline understanding of the unique needs and challenges faced by autistic students, particularly in the Information Technology domain, where opportunities are markedly limited. Through a detailed analysis of behavioral trends over time, we propose a targeted framework for developing applications and technical aids designed to meet these identified needs. Our research underscores the importance of a sequential and evidence-based intervention approach that prioritizes a deep understanding of each child's behavioral and emotional landscape as the basis for effective skill development. By shifting the focus toward early identification of behavioral patterns, we aim to foster a more inclusive and supportive learning environment that can significantly improve the educational and developmental trajectory of children with ASD.

Abstract: Medical decision systems increasingly rely on data from multiple sources to ensure reliable and unbiased diagnosis. However, existing multimodal learning models fail to achieve this goal because they often ignore two critical challenges. First, various data modalities may learn unevenly, thereby converging to a model biased towards certain modalities. Second, the model may emphasize learning on certain demographic groups causing unfair performances. The two aspects can influence each other, as different data modalities may favor respective groups during optimization, leading to both imbalanced and unfair multimodal learning. This paper proposes a novel approach called MultiFair for multimodal medical classification, which addresses these challenges with a dual-level gradient modulation process. MultiFair dynamically modulates training gradients regarding the optimization direction and magnitude at both data modality and group levels. We conduct extensive experiments on two multimodal medical datasets with different demographic groups. The results show that MultiFair outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal learning and fairness learning methods.

Abstract: Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) provides a principled Bayesian approach to inverse problems by sampling from $p(x_0 \mid y)$. However, in practice, the goal of inverse problem solving is not to cover the posterior but to recover the most accurate reconstruction, where optimization-based diffusion solvers often excel despite lacking a clear probabilistic foundation. We introduce Local MAP Sampling (LMAPS), a new inference framework that iteratively solving local MAP subproblems along the diffusion trajectory. This perspective clarifies their connection to global MAP estimation and DPS, offering a unified probabilistic interpretation for optimization-based methods. Building on this foundation, we develop practical algorithms with a probabilistically interpretable covariance approximation, a reformulated objective for stability and interpretability, and a gradient approximation for non-differentiable operators. Across a broad set of image restoration and scientific tasks, LMAPS achieves state-of-the-art performance, including $\geq 2$ dB gains on motion deblurring, JPEG restoration, and quantization, and $>1.5$ dB improvements on inverse scattering benchmarks.

Abstract: Surgical video datasets are essential for scene understanding, enabling procedural modeling and intra-operative support. However, these datasets are often heavily imbalanced, with rare actions and tools under-represented, which limits the robustness of downstream models. We address this challenge with $SurgiFlowVid$, a sparse and controllable video diffusion framework for generating surgical videos of under-represented classes. Our approach introduces a dual-prediction diffusion module that jointly denoises RGB frames and optical flow, providing temporal inductive biases to improve motion modeling from limited samples. In addition, a sparse visual encoder conditions the generation process on lightweight signals (e.g., sparse segmentation masks or RGB frames), enabling controllability without dense annotations. We validate our approach on three surgical datasets across tasks including action recognition, tool presence detection, and laparoscope motion prediction. Synthetic data generated by our method yields consistent gains of 10-20% over competitive baselines, establishing $SurgiFlowVid$ as a promising strategy to mitigate data imbalance and advance surgical video understanding methods.

Abstract: Most efforts to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) involve either scaling the number of parameters and the size of training data, or scaling inference computation by letting models generate complex chains of thought. Motivated by interpretability studies showing that the crucial computation required for reasoning tasks is concentrated in a limited range of layers, we introduce Encode-Think-Decode (ETD), a method that enhances the reasoning capabilities of a base model by training it to iterate over a small subset of reasoning-relevant layers during the mid-training stage. ETD amplifies latent reasoning while preserving the original architecture, parameter count, hyperparameters, and training data composition. When iterating on the selected layers at inference time, ETD models yield substantial gains on 17 reasoning benchmarks, including +28.4% relative accuracy improvement on GSM8K and +36% on MATH with the OLMo-2 1B Base model. We also explore an adaptive depth strategy that adjusts the computation per input token. Our results show that recursive latent reasoning offers a simple and effective path to stronger LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Phase transitions mark qualitative reorganizations of collective behavior, yet identifying their boundaries remains challenging whenever analytic solutions are absent and conventional simulations fail. Here we introduce learnability as a universal criterion, defined as the ability of a transformer model containing attention mechanism to extract structure from microscopic states. Using self-supervised learning and Monte Carlo generated configurations of the two-dimensional Ising model, we show that ordered phases correspond to enhanced learnability, manifested in both reduced training loss and structured attention patterns, while disordered phases remain resistant to learning. Two unsupervised diagnostics, the sharp jump in training loss and the rise in attention entropy, recover the critical temperature in excellent agreement with the exact value. Our results establish learnability as a data-driven marker of phase transitions and highlight deep parallels between long-range order in condensed matter and the emergence of structure in modern language models.

Abstract: To overcome the bottleneck of classical path planning schemes in solving NP problems and address the predicament faced by current mainstream quantum path planning frameworks in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, this study attempts to construct a quantum path planning solution based on parallel Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) architecture. Specifically, the grid path planning problem is mapped to the problem of finding the minimum quantum energy state. Two parallel QAOA circuits are built to simultaneously execute two solution processes, namely connectivity energy calculation and path energy calculation. A classical algorithm is employed to filter out unreasonable solutions of connectivity energy, and finally, the approximate optimal solution to the path planning problem is obtained by merging the calculation results of the two parallel circuits. The research findings indicate that by setting appropriate filter parameters, quantum states corresponding to position points with extremely low occurrence probabilities can be effectively filtered out, thereby increasing the probability of obtaining the target quantum state. Even when the circuit layer number p is only 1, the theoretical solution of the optimal path coding combination can still be found by leveraging the critical role of the filter. Compared with serial circuits, parallel circuits exhibit a significant advantage, as they can find the optimal feasible path coding combination with the highest probability.

Abstract: Modern long-context large language models (LLMs) perform well on synthetic "needle-in-a-haystack" (NIAH) benchmarks, but such tests overlook how noisy contexts arise from biased retrieval and agentic workflows. We argue that haystack engineering is necessary to construct noisy long contexts that faithfully capture key real-world factors -- distraction from heterogeneous biased retrievers and cascading errors in agentic workflows -- to test models' long-context robustness. We instantiate it through HaystackCraft, a new NIAH benchmark built on the full English Wikipedia hyperlink network with multi-hop questions. HaystackCraft evaluates how heterogeneous retrieval strategies (e.g., sparse, dense, hybrid, and graph-based) affect distractor composition, haystack ordering, and downstream LLM performance. HaystackCraft further extends NIAH to dynamic, LLM-dependent settings that simulate agentic operations, where models refine queries, reflect on their past reasonings, and decide when to stop. Experiments with 15 long-context models show that (1) while stronger dense retrievers can introduce more challenging distractors, graph-based reranking simultaneously improves retrieval effectiveness and mitigates more harmful distractors; (2) in agentic tests, even advanced models like Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 suffer cascading failures from self-generated distractors or struggle to perform early stops. These results highlight persistent challenges in agentic long-context reasoning and establish HaystackCraft as a valuable testbed for future progress.

Abstract: Standard ASR evaluation metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) tend to unfairly penalize morphological and syntactic nuances that do not significantly alter sentence semantics. We introduce an LLM-based scoring rubric LASER that leverages state-of-the-art LLMs' in-context learning abilities to learn from prompts with detailed examples. Hindi LASER scores using Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved a very high correlation score of 94% with human annotations. Hindi examples in the prompt were also effective in analyzing errors in other Indian languages such as Marathi, Kannada and Malayalam. We also demonstrate how a smaller LLM like Llama 3 can be finetuned on word-pair examples derived from reference and ASR predictions to predict what kind of penalty should be applied with close to 89% accuracy.

Abstract: Risk management is a prominent issue in peer-to-peer lending. An investor may naturally reduce his risk exposure by diversifying instead of putting all his money on one loan. In that case, an investor may want to minimize the Value-at-Risk (VaR) or Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) of his loan portfolio. We propose a low degree of freedom deep neural network model, DeNN, as well as a high degree of freedom model, DSNN, to tackle the problem. In particular, our models predict not only the default probability of a loan but also the time when it will default. The experiments demonstrate that both models can significantly reduce the portfolio VaRs at different confidence levels, compared to benchmarks. More interestingly, the low degree of freedom model, DeNN, outperforms DSNN in most scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce Mixture-of-Gaussians with Uncertainty-based Gating (MoGU), a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework designed for regression tasks and applied to time series forecasting. Unlike conventional MoEs that provide only point estimates, MoGU models each expert's output as a Gaussian distribution. This allows it to directly quantify both the forecast (the mean) and its inherent uncertainty (variance). MoGU's core innovation is its uncertainty-based gating mechanism, which replaces the traditional input-based gating network by using each expert's estimated variance to determine its contribution to the final prediction. Evaluated across diverse time series forecasting benchmarks, MoGU consistently outperforms single-expert models and traditional MoE setups. It also provides well-quantified, informative uncertainties that directly correlate with prediction errors, enhancing forecast reliability.

Abstract: Lung cancer (LC) is the third most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer deaths in the US. Although smoking is the primary risk factor, the occurrence of LC in never-smokers and familial aggregation studies highlight a genetic component. Genetic biomarkers identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are promising tools for assessing LC risk. We introduce HEMERA (Human-Explainable Transformer Model for Estimating Lung Cancer Risk using GWAS Data), a new framework that applies explainable transformer-based deep learning to GWAS data of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for predicting LC risk. Unlike prior approaches, HEMERA directly processes raw genotype data without clinical covariates, introducing additive positional encodings, neural genotype embeddings, and refined variant filtering. A post hoc explainability module based on Layer-wise Integrated Gradients enables attribution of model predictions to specific SNPs, aligning strongly with known LC risk loci. Trained on data from 27,254 Million Veteran Program participants, HEMERA achieved >99% AUC (area under receiver characteristics) score. These findings support transparent, hypothesis-generating models for personalized LC risk assessment and early intervention.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) with Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents are gaining attention, yet fewer studies explore their team dynamics. Inspired by human team science, we propose a multi-agent framework to examine core aspects of team science: structure, diversity, and interaction dynamics. We evaluate team performance across four tasks: CommonsenseQA, StrategyQA, Social IQa, and Latent Implicit Hate, spanning commonsense and social reasoning. Our results show that flat teams tend to perform better than hierarchical ones, while diversity has a nuanced impact. Interviews suggest agents are overconfident about their team performance, yet post-task reflections reveal both appreciation for collaboration and challenges in integration, including limited conversational coordination.

Abstract: Ultra-low dose CT (uLDCT) significantly reduces radiation exposure but introduces severe noise and artifacts. It also leads to substantial spatial misalignment between uLDCT and normal dose CT (NDCT) image pairs. This poses challenges for directly applying existing denoising networks trained on synthetic noise or aligned data. To address this core challenge in uLDCT denoising, this paper proposes an innovative denoising framework based on an Image Purification (IP) strategy. First, we construct a real clinical uLDCT lung dataset. Then, we propose an Image Purification strategy that generates structurally aligned uLDCT-NDCT image pairs, providing a high-quality data foundation for network training. Building upon this, we propose a Frequency-domain Flow Matching (FFM) model, which works synergistically with the IP strategy to excellently preserve the anatomical structure integrity of denoised images. Experiments on the real clinical dataset demonstrate that our IP strategy significantly enhances the performance of multiple mainstream denoising models on the uLDCT task. Notably, our proposed FFM model combined with the IP strategy achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in anatomical structure preservation. This study provides an effective solution to the data mismatch problem in real-world uLDCT denoising. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/MonkeyDadLufy/flow-matching.

Abstract: Recent advances in speech large language models (speech LLMs) have enabled seamless spoken interactions, but these systems still struggle with complex reasoning tasks. Previously, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuning has been to shown to significantly improve the reasoning abilities of text-based LLMs. In this work, we investigate the effect of CoT fine-tuning for multi-stream speech LLMs, demonstrating that reasoning in text space improves the accuracy of speech LLMs by 2.4x, on average, over a suite of spoken reasoning tasks. Beyond accuracy, the latency of the spoken response is a crucial factor for interacting with voice-based agents. Inspired by the human behavior of "thinking while listening," we propose methods to reduce the additional latency from reasoning by allowing the model to start reasoning before the user query has ended. To achieve this, we introduce an entropy-based metric, "question completeness," which acts as an indicator to guide the model on the optimal time to start reasoning. This method provides greater control over the accuracy-latency trade-off compared with heuristic-based approaches and, under equivalent latency conditions, yields a 4% accuracy gain on ARC-Easy. Finally, we use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on preference data created using rejection sampling to push the accuracy-latency pareto frontier further, resulting in a 70% reduction in latency without loss in accuracy.

Abstract: Recent Long-Context Language Models (LCLMs) can process hundreds of thousands of tokens in a single prompt, enabling new opportunities for knowledge-intensive multi-hop reasoning by integrating large sets of retrieved documents or, in some cases, directly all necessary information. However, simply feeding more documents into the context window fails to capture how evidence should be connected. We address this gap with thought templates, which recast reasoning as reusable thought caches, derived from prior problem solving traces, structuring how evidence is combined and guiding multi-hop inference with factual documents. To keep these templates effective, we propose an update strategy that iteratively refines templates derived from training data through natural-language feedback. Across diverse benchmarks and LCLM families, our approach delivers consistent gains over strong baselines in both retrieval-based and retrieval-free settings. Furthermore, we show that optimized templates can be distilled into smaller open-source models, demonstrating its broad applicability and transparent reasoning reuse. We refer to our framework as Thought Template Augmented LCLMs (ToTAL).

Recent advances in multimodal large language models have demonstrated impressive generalization and visual understanding capability, yet their application to time series remains constrained by the modality gap between continuous numerical data and discrete natural language. To bridge this gap, we introduce MLLM4TS, a novel framework that leverages multimodal large language models for general time-series analysis by integrating a dedicated vision branch. Each time-series channel is rendered as a horizontally stacked color-coded line plot in one composite image to capture spatial dependencies across channels, and a temporal-aware visual patch alignment strategy then aligns visual patches with their corresponding time segments. MLLM4TS fuses fine-grained temporal details from the numerical data with global contextual information derived from the visual representation, providing a unified foundation for multimodal time-series analysis. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of MLLM4TS across both predictive tasks (e.g., classification) and generative tasks (e.g., anomaly detection and forecasting). These results underscore the potential of integrating visual modalities with pretrained language models to achieve robust and generalizable time-series analysis.

Abstract: Accurate classification of sleep stages is crucial for the diagnosis and management of sleep disorders. Conventional approaches for sleep scoring rely on manual annotation or features extracted from EEG signals in the time or frequency domain. This study proposes a novel framework for automated sleep stage scoring using time-frequency analysis based on the wavelet transform. The Sleep-EDF Expanded Database (sleep-cassette recordings) was used for evaluation. The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) generated time-frequency maps that capture both transient and oscillatory patterns across frequency bands relevant to sleep staging. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed wavelet-based representation, combined with ensemble learning, achieves an overall accuracy of 88.37 percent and a macro-averaged F1 score of 73.15, outperforming conventional machine learning methods and exhibiting comparable or superior performance to recent deep learning approaches. These findings highlight the potential of wavelet analysis for robust, interpretable, and clinically applicable sleep stage classification.

<title>OWL: Overcoming Window Length-Dependence in Speculative Decoding for Long-Context Inputs</title>

Abstract: Speculative decoding promises faster inference for large language models (LLMs), yet existing methods fail to generalize to real-world settings. Benchmarks typically assume short contexts (e.g., 2K tokens), whereas practical workloads involve long contexts. We find current approaches degrade severely with long contexts; for instance, EAGLE3 even slows down the generation speed by 0.81x. We address these limitations by releasing a new long-context benchmark (LongSpecBench) and introducing a novel model (OWL). OWL achieves about 5x higher acceptance length than EAGLE3 on long-context inputs through three innovations: (1) an LSTM-based drafter conditioned only on the last-token state, making it generalize to various lengths, (2) a special token [SPEC] in the verifier that produces richer representation for drafter, and (3) a hybrid algorithm combining both tree and non-tree decoding methods. We release all code and datasets to advance future research.

Abstract: Despite impressive visual fidelity, modern video generative models frequently produce sequences that violate intuitive physical laws, such as objects floating, teleporting, or morphing in ways that defy causality. While humans can easily detect such implausibilities, there remains no robust method for quantitatively assessing physical realism in video. In this work, we explore whether Video-Language Models (VLMs) can be trained to serve as reliable judges of physical plausibility. We find that existing VLMs struggle to identify physics violations, exposing fundamental limitations in their temporal and causal reasoning. To address this, we introduce TRAVL, a fine-tuning recipe that combines a balanced training dataset with a trajectory-aware attention module to improve motion encoding and discrimination in VLMs. To evaluate physical reasoning more rigorously, we propose ImplausiBench, a benchmark of 300 videos (150 real, 150 generated) that removes linguistic biases and isolates visual-temporal understanding. Performance is reported both with gold-standard human judgments and stricter LLM-as-judge metrics. Together, TRAVL and ImplausiBench offer a unified framework for probing and improving physical plausibility in multimodal models, shedding light on a challenging and underexplored aspect of visual-temporal understanding.

<title>Label Semantics for Robust Hyperspectral Image Classification</title>

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) classification is a critical tool with widespread applications across diverse fields such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, medicine, and materials science. Due to the limited availability of high-quality training samples and the high dimensionality of spectral data, HSI classification models are prone to overfitting and often face challenges in balancing accuracy and computational complexity. Furthermore, most of HSI classification models are monomodal, where it solely relies on spectral-spatial data to learn decision boundaries in the high dimensional embedding space. To address this, we propose a general-purpose Semantic Spectral-Spatial Fusion Network (S3FN) that uses contextual, class specific textual descriptions to complement the training of an HSI classification model. Specifically, S3FN leverages LLMs to generate comprehensive textual descriptions for each class label that captures their unique characteristics and spectral behaviors. These descriptions are then embedded into a vector space using a pre-trained text encoder such as BERT or RoBERTa to extract meaningful label semantics which in turn leads to a better feature-label alignment for improved classification performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate our model on three diverse HSI benchmark datasets - Hyperspectral Wood, HyperspectralBlueberries, and DeepHS-Fruit and report significant performance boost. Our results highlight the synergy between textual semantics and spectral-spatial data, paving the way for further advancements in semantically augmented HSI classification models.

Abstract: This study applies BERTopic, a transformer-based topic modeling technique, to the lmsys-chat-1m dataset, a multilingual conversational corpus built from head-to-head evaluations of large language models (LLMs). Each user prompt is paired with two anonymized LLM responses and a human preference label, used to assess user evaluation of competing model outputs. The main objective is uncovering thematic patterns in these conversations and examining their relation to user preferences, particularly if certain LLMs are consistently preferred within specific topics. A robust preprocessing pipeline was designed for multilingual variation, balancing dialogue turns, and cleaning noisy or redacted data. BERTopic extracted over 29 coherent topics including artificial intelligence, programming, ethics, and cloud infrastructure. We analysed relationships between topics and model preferences to identify trends in model-topic alignment. Visualization techniques included inter-topic distance maps, topic probability distributions, and model-versus-topic matrices. Our findings inform domain-specific fine-tuning and optimization strategies for improving real-world LLM performance and user satisfaction.

Abstract: Deploying natural language processing (NLP) models on mobile platforms requires models that can adapt across diverse applications while remaining efficient in memory and computation. We investigate pre-finetuning strategies to enhance the adaptability of lightweight BERT-like encoders for two fundamental NLP task families: named entity recognition (NER) and text classification. While pre-finetuning improves downstream performance for each task family individually, we find that na\"ive multi-task pre-finetuning introduces conflicting optimization signals that degrade overall performance. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective multi-task pre-finetuning framework based on task-primary LoRA modules, which enables a single shared encoder backbone with modular adapters. Our approach achieves performance comparable to individual pre-finetuning while meeting practical deployment constraint. Experiments on 21 downstream tasks show average improvements of +0.8% for NER and +8.8% for text classification, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method for versatile mobile NLP applications.

Abstract: This review aims to conduct a comparative analysis of liquid neural networks (LNNs) and traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their variants, such as long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and gated recurrent units (GRUs). The core dimensions of the analysis include model accuracy, memory efficiency, and generalization ability. By systematically reviewing existing research, this paper explores the basic principles, mathematical models, key characteristics, and inherent challenges of these neural network architectures in processing sequential data. Research findings reveal that LNN, as an emerging, biologically inspired, continuous-time dynamic neural network, demonstrates significant potential in handling noisy, non-stationary data, and achieving out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Additionally, some LNN variants outperform traditional RNN in terms of parameter efficiency and computational speed. However, RNN remains a cornerstone in sequence modeling due to its mature ecosystem and successful applications across various tasks. This review identifies the commonalities and differences between LNNs and RNNs, summarizes their respective shortcomings and challenges, and points out valuable directions for future research, particularly emphasizing the importance of improving the scalability of LNNs to promote their application in broader and more complex scenarios.

Abstract: This study conducts a computational linguistic analysis of pandemic-related online discourse to examine how language distinguishes health misinformation from factual communication. Drawing on three corpora: COVID-19 false narratives (n = 7588), general COVID-19 content (n = 10700), and Monkeypox-related posts (n = 5787), we identify significant differences in readability, rhetorical markers, and persuasive language use. COVID-19 misinformation exhibited markedly lower readability scores and contained over twice the frequency of fear-related or persuasive terms compared to the other datasets. It also showed minimal use of exclamation marks, contrasting with the more emotive style of Monkeypox content. These patterns suggest that misinformation employs a deliberately complex rhetorical style embedded with emotional cues, a combination that may enhance its perceived credibility. Our findings contribute to the growing body of work on digital health misinformation by highlighting linguistic indicators that may aid detection efforts. They also inform public health messaging strategies and theoretical models of crisis communication in networked media environments. At the same time, the study acknowledges limitations, including reliance on traditional readability indices, use of a deliberately narrow persuasive lexicon, and reliance on static aggregate analysis. Future research should therefore incorporate longitudinal designs, broader emotion lexicons, and platform-sensitive approaches to strengthen robustness.

Abstract: Well-designed open-source software drives progress in Machine Learning (ML) research. While static graph ML enjoys mature frameworks like PyTorch Geometric and DGL, ML for temporal graphs (TG), networks that evolve over time, lacks comparable infrastructure. Existing TG libraries are often tailored to specific architectures, hindering support for diverse models in this rapidly evolving field. Additionally, the divide between continuous- and discrete-time dynamic graph methods (CTDG and DTDG) limits direct comparisons and idea transfer. To address these gaps, we introduce Temporal Graph Modelling (TGM), a research-oriented library for ML on temporal graphs, the first to unify CTDG and DTDG approaches. TGM offers first-class support for dynamic node features, time-granularity conversions, and native handling of link-, node-, and graph-level tasks. Empirically, TGM achieves an average 7.8x speedup across multiple models, datasets, and tasks compared to the widely used DyGLib, and an average 175x speedup on graph discretization relative to available implementations. Beyond efficiency, we show in our experiments how TGM unlocks entirely new research possibilities by enabling dynamic graph property prediction and time-driven training paradigms, opening the door to questions previously impractical to study.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) work by manipulating the geometry of input embedding vectors over multiple layers. Here, we ask: how are the input vocabulary representations of language models structured, and how and when does this structure evolve over training? To answer this question, we use representational similarity analysis, running a suite of experiments that correlate the geometric structure of the input embeddings and output embeddings of two open-source models (Pythia 12B and OLMo 7B) with semantic, syntactic, and frequency-based metrics over the course of training. Our key findings are as follows: 1) During training, the vocabulary embedding geometry quickly converges to high correlations with a suite of semantic and syntactic features; 2) Embeddings of high-frequency and function words (e.g., "the," "of") converge to their final vectors faster than lexical and low-frequency words, which retain some alignment with the bias in their random initializations. These findings help map the dynamic trajectory by which input embeddings organize around linguistic structure, revealing distinct roles for word frequency and function. Our findings motivate a deeper study of how the evolution of vocabulary geometry may facilitate specific capability gains during model training.

Abstract: Dynamic trust evaluation in large, rapidly evolving graphs requires models that can capture changing relationships, express calibrated confidence, and resist adversarial manipulation. DGTEN (Deep Gaussian-based Trust Evaluation Network) introduces a unified graph framework that achieves all three by combining uncertainty-aware message passing, expressive temporal modeling, and built-in defenses against trust-targeted attacks. It represents nodes and edges as Gaussian distributions so that both semantic signals and epistemic uncertainty propagate through the graph neural network, enabling risk-aware trust decisions rather than overconfident guesses. To model how trust evolves, it employs hybrid Absolute-Gaussian-Hourglass (HAGH) positional encoding with Kolmogorov-Arnold network-based unbiased multi-head attention, followed by an ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based residual learning module to jointly capture abrupt shifts and smooth trends. Robust adaptive ensemble coefficient analysis prunes or down-weights suspicious interactions using complementary cosine and Jaccard similarity measures, mitigating reputation laundering, sabotage, and on/off attacks. On two signed Bitcoin trust networks, DGTEN delivers significant improvements: in single-timeslot prediction on Bitcoin-Alpha, it improves MCC by 10.77% over the best dynamic baseline; in the cold-start scenario, it achieves a 16.41% MCC gain - the largest across all tasks and datasets. Under adversarial on/off attacks, it surpasses the baseline by up to 11.63% MCC. These results validate the effectiveness of the unified DGTEN framework.

Abstract: Recommendation systems have traditionally relied on short-term engagement signals, such as clicks and likes, to personalize content. However, these signals are often noisy, sparse, and insufficient for capturing long-term user satisfaction and retention. We introduce Retentive Relevance, a novel content-level survey-based feedback measure that directly assesses users' intent to return to the platform for similar content. Unlike other survey measures that focus on immediate satisfaction, Retentive Relevance targets forward-looking behavioral intentions, capturing longer term user intentions and providing a stronger predictor of retention. We validate Retentive Relevance using psychometric methods, establishing its convergent, discriminant, and behavioral validity. Through large-scale offline modeling, we show that Retentive Relevance significantly outperforms both engagement signals and other survey measures in predicting next-day retention, especially for users with limited historical engagement. We develop a production-ready proxy model that integrates Retentive Relevance into the final stage of a multi-stage ranking system on a social media platform. Calibrated score adjustments based on this model yield substantial improvements in engagement, and retention, while reducing exposure to low-quality content, as demonstrated by large-scale A/B experiments. This work provides the first empirically validated framework linking content-level user perceptions to retention outcomes in production systems. We offer a scalable, user-centered solution that advances both platform growth and user experience. Our work has broad implications for responsible AI development.

Abstract: This paper presents Ryt AI, an LLM-native agentic framework that powers Ryt Bank to enable customers to execute core financial transactions through natural language conversation. This represents the first global regulator-approved deployment worldwide where conversational AI functions as the primary banking interface, in contrast to prior assistants that have been limited to advisory or support roles. Built entirely in-house, Ryt AI is powered by ILMU, a closed-source LLM developed internally, and replaces rigid multi-screen workflows with a single dialogue orchestrated by four LLM-powered agents (Guardrails, Intent, Payment, and FAQ). Each agent attaches a task-specific LoRA adapter to ILMU, which is hosted within the bank's infrastructure to ensure consistent behavior with minimal overhead. Deterministic guardrails, human-in-the-loop confirmation, and a stateless audit architecture provide defense-in-depth for security and compliance. The result is Banking Done Right: demonstrating that regulator-approved natural-language interfaces can reliably support core financial operations under strict governance.

Abstract: While most reinforcement learning methods today flatten the distribution of future returns to a single scalar value, distributional RL methods exploit the return distribution to provide stronger learning signals and to enable applications in exploration and safe RL. While the predominant method for estimating the return distribution is by modeling it as a categorical distribution over discrete bins or estimating a finite number of quantiles, such approaches leave unanswered questions about the fine-grained structure of the return distribution and about how to distinguish states with high return uncertainty for decision-making. The key idea in this paper is to use modern, flexible flow-based models to estimate the full future return distributions and identify those states with high return variance. We do so by formulating a new flow-matching objective that generates probability density paths satisfying the distributional Bellman equation. Building upon the learned flow models, we estimate the return uncertainty of distinct states using a new flow derivative ODE. We additionally use this uncertainty information to prioritize learning a more accurate return estimation on certain transitions. We compare our method (Value Flows) with prior methods in the offline and online-to-online settings. Experiments on $37$ state-based and $25$ image-based benchmark tasks demonstrate that Value Flows achieves a $1.3\times$ improvement on average in success rates.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows enable powerful downstream applications but impose significant memory overhead, as caching all key-value (KV) states scales linearly with sequence length and batch size. Existing cache eviction methods address this by exploiting attention sparsity, yet they typically rank tokens heuristically using accumulated attention weights without considering their true impact on attention outputs. We propose Optimal Brain Cache (OBCache), a principled framework that formulates cache eviction as a layer-wise structured pruning problem. Building upon the Optimal Brain Damage (OBD) theory, OBCache quantifies token saliency by measuring the perturbation in attention outputs induced by pruning tokens, with closed-form scores derived for isolated keys, isolated values, and joint key-value pairs. Our scores account not only for attention weights but also for information from value states and attention outputs, thereby enhancing existing eviction strategies with output-aware signals. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen models demonstrate that replacing the heuristic scores in existing works, which estimate token saliency across different query positions, with OBCache's output-aware scores consistently improves long-context accuracy.

Abstract: The increasing influence of unstructured external information, such as news articles, on stock prices has attracted growing attention in financial markets. Despite recent advances, most existing newsbased forecasting models represent all articles using sentiment scores or average embeddings that capture the general tone but fail to provide quantitative, context-aware explanations of the impacts of public sentiment on predictions. To address this limitation, we propose an interpretable keyword-guided network (IKNet), which is an explainable forecasting framework that models the semantic association between individual news keywords and stock price movements. The IKNet identifies salient keywords via FinBERTbased contextual analysis, processes each embedding through a separate nonlinear projection layer, and integrates their representations with the time-series data of technical indicators to forecast next-day closing prices. By applying Shapley Additive Explanations the model generates quantifiable and interpretable attributions for the contribution of each keyword to predictions. Empirical evaluations of S&amp;P 500 data from 2015 to 2024 demonstrate that IKNet outperforms baselines, including recurrent neural networks and transformer models, reducing RMSE by up to 32.9% and improving cumulative returns by 18.5%. Moreover, IKNet enhances transparency by offering contextualized explanations of volatility events driven by public sentiment.

Abstract: Although pyramid networks have demonstrated superior performance in deformable medical image registration, their decoder architectures are inherently prone to propagating and accumulating anatomical structure misalignments. Moreover, most existing models do not adaptively determine the number of iterations for optimization under varying deformation requirements across images, resulting in either premature termination or excessive iterations that degrades registration accuracy. To effectively mitigate the accumulation of anatomical misalignments, we propose the Feature-Enhanced Residual Module (FERM) as the core component of each decoding layer in the pyramid network. FERM comprises three sequential blocks that extract anatomical semantic features, learn to suppress irrelevant features, and estimate the final deformation field, respectively. To adaptively determine the number of iterations for varying images, we propose the dual-stage Threshold-Controlled Iterative (TCI) strategy. In the first stage, TCI assesses registration stability and with asserted stability, it continues with the second stage to evaluate convergence. We coin the model that integrates FERM and TCI as Threshold-Controlled Iterative Pyramid (TCIP). Extensive experiments on three public brain MRI datasets and one abdomen CT dataset demonstrate that TCIP outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) registration networks in terms of accuracy, while maintaining comparable inference speed and a compact model parameter size. Finally, we assess the generalizability of FERM and TCI by integrating them with existing registration networks and further conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of these two proposed methods.

Abstract: Many video workflows benefit from a mixture of user controls with varying granularity, from exact 4D object trajectories and camera paths to coarse text prompts, while existing video generative models are typically trained for fixed input formats. We develop a video synthesis method that addresses this need and generates samples with high controllability for specified elements while maintaining diversity for under-specified ones. We cast the task as variational inference to approximate a composed distribution, leveraging multiple video generation backbones to account for all task constraints collectively. To address the optimization challenge, we break down the problem into step-wise KL divergence minimization over an annealed sequence of distributions, and further propose a context-conditioned factorization technique that reduces modes in the solution space to circumvent local optima. Experiments suggest that our method produces samples with improved controllability, diversity, and 3D consistency compared to prior works.

Abstract: This study evaluates whether integrating curriculum learning with diffusion-based synthetic augmentation can enhance the detection of difficult pulmonary nodules in chest radiographs, particularly those with low size, brightness, and contrast, which often challenge conventional AI models due to data imbalance and limited annotation. A Faster R-CNN with a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) backbone was trained on a hybrid dataset comprising expert-labeled NODE21 (1,213 patients; 52.4 percent male; mean age 63.2 +/- 11.5 years), VinDr-CXR, CheXpert, and 11,206 DDPM-generated synthetic images. Difficulty scores based on size, brightness, and contrast guided curriculum learning. Performance was compared to a non-curriculum baseline using mean average precision (mAP), Dice score, and area under the curve (AUC). Statistical tests included bootstrapped confidence intervals, DeLong tests, and paired t-tests. The curriculum model achieved a mean AUC of 0.95 versus 0.89 for the baseline (p < 0.001), with improvements in sensitivity (70 percent vs. 48 percent) and accuracy (82 percent vs. 70 percent). Stratified analysis demonstrated consistent gains across all difficulty bins (Easy to Very Hard). Grad-CAM visualizations confirmed more anatomically focused attention under curriculum learning. These results suggest that curriculum-guided synthetic augmentation enhances model robustness and generalization for pulmonary nodule detection.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained from AI constitutions and model specifications that establish behavioral guidelines and ethical principles. However, these specifications face critical challenges, including internal conflicts between principles and insufficient coverage of nuanced scenarios. We present a systematic methodology for stress-testing model character specifications, automatically identifying numerous cases of principle contradictions and interpretive ambiguities in current model specs.
  We stress test current model specs by generating scenarios that force explicit tradeoffs between competing value-based principles. Using a comprehensive taxonomy we generate diverse value tradeoff scenarios where models must choose between pairs of legitimate principles that cannot be simultaneously satisfied. We evaluate responses from twelve frontier LLMs across major providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI) and measure behavioral disagreement through value classification scores. Among these scenarios, we identify over 70,000 cases exhibiting significant behavioral divergence. Empirically, we show this high divergence in model behavior strongly predicts underlying problems in model specifications. Through qualitative analysis, we provide numerous example issues in current model specs such as direct contradiction and interpretive ambiguities of several principles. Additionally, our generated dataset also reveals both clear misalignment cases and false-positive refusals across all of the frontier models we study. Lastly, we also provide value prioritization patterns and differences of these models.

Abstract: With the rise of advanced reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) are receiving increasing attention. However, although reasoning improves LLMs' performance on downstream tasks, it also introduces new security risks, as adversaries can exploit these capabilities to conduct backdoor attacks. Existing surveys on backdoor attacks and reasoning security offer comprehensive overviews but lack in-depth analysis of backdoor attacks and defenses targeting LLMs' reasoning abilities. In this paper, we take the first step toward providing a comprehensive review of reasoning-based backdoor attacks in LLMs by analyzing their underlying mechanisms, methodological frameworks, and unresolved challenges. Specifically, we introduce a new taxonomy that offers a unified perspective for summarizing existing approaches, categorizing reasoning-based backdoor attacks into associative, passive, and active. We also present defense strategies against such attacks and discuss current challenges alongside potential directions for future research. This work offers a novel perspective, paving the way for further exploration of secure and trustworthy LLM communities.

<title>Causality Guided Representation Learning for Cross-Style Hate Speech Detection</title>

Abstract: The proliferation of online hate speech poses a significant threat to the harmony of the web. While explicit hate is easily recognized through overt slurs, implicit hate speech is often conveyed through sarcasm, irony, stereotypes, or coded language -- making it harder to detect. Existing hate speech detection models, which predominantly rely on surface-level linguistic cues, fail to generalize effectively across diverse stylistic variations. Moreover, hate speech spread on different platforms often targets distinct groups and adopts unique styles, potentially inducing spurious correlations between them and labels, further challenging current detection approaches. Motivated by these observations, we hypothesize that the generation of hate speech can be modeled as a causal graph involving key factors: contextual environment, creator motivation, target, and style. Guided by this graph, we propose CADET, a causal representation learning framework that disentangles hate speech into interpretable latent factors and then controls confounders, thereby isolating genuine hate intent from superficial linguistic cues. Furthermore, CADET allows counterfactual reasoning by intervening on style within the latent space, naturally guiding the model to robustly identify hate speech in varying forms. CADET demonstrates superior performance in comprehensive experiments, highlighting the potential of causal priors in advancing generalizable hate speech detection.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) presents an attractive paradigm for training intelligent agents without expensive online interactions. However, current approaches still struggle with complex, long-horizon sequential decision making. In this work, we introduce DEtached value learning with Action Sequence (DEAS), a simple yet effective offline RL framework that leverages action sequences for value learning. These temporally extended actions provide richer information than single-step actions and can be interpreted through the options framework via semi-Markov decision process Q-learning, enabling reduction of the effective planning horizon by considering longer sequences at once. However, directly adopting such sequences in actor-critic algorithms introduces excessive value overestimation, which we address through detached value learning that steers value estimates toward in-distribution actions that achieve high return in the offline dataset. We demonstrate that DEAS consistently outperforms baselines on complex, long-horizon tasks from OGBench and can be applied to enhance the performance of large-scale Vision-Language-Action models that predict action sequences, significantly boosting performance in both RoboCasa Kitchen simulation tasks and real-world manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Recursive transformers reuse parameters and iterate over hidden states multiple times, decoupling compute depth from parameter depth. However, under matched compute, recursive models with fewer parameters often lag behind non-recursive counterparts. By probing hidden states, we trace this performance gap to two primary bottlenecks: undifferentiated computation, where the core is forced to adopt a similar computational pattern at every iteration, and information overload, where long-lived and transient information must coexist in a single hidden state. To address the issues, we introduce a Memory-as-State-Highways (MeSH) scheme, which externalizes state management into an explicit memory buffer and employs lightweight routers to dynamically diversify computation across iterations. Probing visualizations confirm that MeSH successfully resolves the pathologies by inducing functional specialization across iterations. On the Pythia suite (160M-1.4B), MeSH-enhanced recursive transformers consistently improve over recursive baselines and outperforms its larger non-recursive counterpart at the 1.4B scale, improving average downstream accuracy by +1.06% with 33% fewer non-embedding parameters. Our analysis establishes MeSH as a scalable and principled architecture for building stronger recursive models.

<title>AppForge: From Assistant to Independent Developer - Are GPTs Ready for Software Development?</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capability in function-level code generation tasks. Unlike isolated functions, real-world applications demand reasoning over the entire software system: developers must orchestrate how different components interact, maintain consistency across states over time, and ensure the application behaves correctly within the lifecycle and framework constraints. Yet, no existing benchmark adequately evaluates whether LLMs can bridge this gap and construct entire software systems from scratch. To address this gap, we propose APPFORGE, a benchmark consisting of 101 software development problems drawn from real-world Android apps. Given a natural language specification detailing the app functionality, a language model is tasked with implementing the functionality into an Android app from scratch. Developing an Android app from scratch requires understanding and coordinating app states, lifecycle management, and asynchronous operations, calling for LLMs to generate context-aware, robust, and maintainable code. To construct APPFORGE, we design a multi-agent system to automatically summarize the main functionalities from app documents and navigate the app to synthesize test cases validating the functional correctness of app implementation. Following rigorous manual verification by Android development experts, APPFORGE incorporates the test cases within an automated evaluation framework that enables reproducible assessment without human intervention, making it easily adoptable for future research. Our evaluation on 12 flagship LLMs show that all evaluated models achieve low effectiveness, with the best-performing model (GPT-5) developing only 18.8% functionally correct applications, highlighting fundamental limitations in current models' ability to handle complex, multi-component software engineering challenges.

Abstract: Ultra-high dynamic range (UHDR) scenes exhibit significant exposure disparities between bright and dark regions. Such conditions are commonly encountered in nighttime scenes with light sources. Even with standard exposure settings, a bimodal intensity distribution with boundary peaks often emerges, making it difficult to preserve both highlight and shadow details simultaneously. RGB-based bracketing methods can capture details at both ends using short-long exposure pairs, but are susceptible to misalignment and ghosting artifacts. We found that a short-exposure image already retains sufficient highlight detail. The main challenge of UHDR reconstruction lies in denoising and recovering information in dark regions. In comparison to the RGB images, RAW images, thanks to their higher bit depth and more predictable noise characteristics, offer greater potential for addressing this challenge. This raises a key question: can we learn to see everything in UHDR scenes using only a single short-exposure RAW image? In this study, we rely solely on a single short-exposure frame, which inherently avoids ghosting and motion blur, making it particularly robust in dynamic scenes. To achieve that, we introduce UltraLED, a two-stage framework that performs exposure correction via a ratio map to balance dynamic range, followed by a brightness-aware RAW denoiser to enhance detail recovery in dark regions. To support this setting, we design a 9-stop bracketing pipeline to synthesize realistic UHDR images and contribute a corresponding dataset based on diverse scenes, using only the shortest exposure as input for reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that UltraLED significantly outperforms existing single-frame approaches. Our code and dataset are made publicly available at https://srameo.github.io/projects/ultraled.

<title>Parallel Test-Time Scaling for Latent Reasoning Models</title>

Abstract: Parallel test-time scaling (TTS) is a pivotal approach for enhancing large language models (LLMs), typically by sampling multiple token-based chains-of-thought in parallel and aggregating outcomes through voting or search. Recent advances in latent reasoning, where intermediate reasoning unfolds in continuous vector spaces, offer a more efficient alternative to explicit Chain-of-Thought, yet whether such latent models can similarly benefit from parallel TTS remains open, mainly due to the absence of sampling mechanisms in continuous space, and the lack of probabilistic signals for advanced trajectory aggregation. \
This work enables parallel TTS for latent reasoning models by addressing the above issues. For sampling, we introduce two uncertainty-inspired stochastic strategies: Monte Carlo Dropout and Additive Gaussian Noise. For aggregation, we design a Latent Reward Model (LatentRM) trained with step-wise contrastive objective to score and guide latent reasoning. Extensive experiments and visualization analyses show that both sampling strategies scale effectively with compute and exhibit distinct exploration dynamics, while LatentRM enables effective trajectory selection. Together, our explorations open a new direction for scalable inference in continuous spaces. Code released at https://github.com/YRYangang/LatentTTS.

Abstract: In online advertising, heterogeneous advertiser requirements give rise to numerous customized bidding tasks that are typically optimized independently, resulting in extensive computation and limited data efficiency. Multi-task learning offers a principled framework to train these tasks jointly through shared representations. However, existing multi-task optimization strategies are primarily guided by training dynamics and often generalize poorly in volatile bidding environments. To this end, we present Validation-Aligned Multi-task Optimization (VAMO), which adaptively assigns task weights based on the alignment between per-task training gradients and a held-out validation gradient, thereby steering updates toward validation improvement and better matching deployment objectives. We further equip the framework with a periodicity-aware temporal module and couple it with an advanced generative auto-bidding backbone to enhance cross-task transfer of seasonal structure and strengthen bidding performance. Meanwhile, we provide theoretical insights into the proposed method, e.g., convergence guarantee and alignment analysis. Extensive experiments on both simulated and large-scale real-world advertising systems consistently demonstrate significant improvements over typical baselines, illuminating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with external tools have demonstrated enhanced performance on complex reasoning tasks. The widespread adoption of this tool-augmented reasoning is hindered by the scarcity of domain-specific tools. For instance, in domains such as physics question answering, suitable and specialized tools are often missing. Recent work has explored automating tool creation by extracting reusable functions from Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning traces; however, these approaches face a critical scalability bottleneck. As the number of generated tools grows, storing them in an unstructured collection leads to significant retrieval challenges, including an expanding search space and ambiguity between function-related tools. To address this, we propose a systematic approach to automatically refactor an unstructured collection of tools into a structured tool library. Our system first generates discrete, task-specific tools and clusters them into semantically coherent topics. Within each cluster, we introduce a multi-agent framework to consolidate scattered functionalities: a code agent refactors code to extract shared logic and creates versatile, aggregated tools, while a reviewing agent ensures that these aggregated tools maintain the complete functional capabilities of the original set. This process transforms numerous question-specific tools into a smaller set of powerful, aggregated tools without loss of functionality. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves tool retrieval accuracy and overall reasoning performance across multiple reasoning tasks. Furthermore, our method shows enhanced scalability compared with baselines as the number of question-specific increases.

Abstract: Learning manipulation skills from human demonstration videos presents a promising yet challenging problem, primarily due to the significant embodiment gap between human body and robot manipulators. Existing methods rely on paired datasets or hand-crafted rewards, which limit scalability and generalization. We propose TrajSkill, a framework for Trajectory Conditioned Cross-embodiment Skill Transfer, enabling robots to acquire manipulation skills directly from human demonstration videos. Our key insight is to represent human motions as sparse optical flow trajectories, which serve as embodiment-agnostic motion cues by removing morphological variations while preserving essential dynamics. Conditioned on these trajectories together with visual and textual inputs, TrajSkill jointly synthesizes temporally consistent robot manipulation videos and translates them into executable actions, thereby achieving cross-embodiment skill transfer. Extensive experiments are conducted, and the results on simulation data (MetaWorld) show that TrajSkill reduces FVD by 39.6\% and KVD by 36.6\% compared with the state-of-the-art, and improves cross-embodiment success rate by up to 16.7\%. Real-robot experiments in kitchen manipulation tasks further validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating practical human-to-robot skill transfer across embodiments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at single-turn tasks such as instruction following and summarization, yet real-world deployments require sustained multi-turn interactions where user goals and conversational context persist and evolve. A recurring challenge in this setting is context drift: the gradual divergence of a model's outputs from goal-consistent behavior across turns. Unlike single-turn errors, drift unfolds temporally and is poorly captured by static evaluation metrics. In this work, we present a study of context drift in multi-turn interactions and propose a simple dynamical framework to interpret its behavior. We formalize drift as the turn-wise KL divergence between the token-level predictive distributions of the test model and a goal-consistent reference model, and propose a recurrence model that interprets its evolution as a bounded stochastic process with restoring forces and controllable interventions. We instantiate this framework in both synthetic long-horizon rewriting tasks and realistic user-agent simulations such as in $\tau$-Bench, measuring drift for several open-weight LLMs that are used as user simulators. Our experiments consistently reveal stable, noise-limited equilibria rather than runaway degradation, and demonstrate that simple reminder interventions reliably reduce divergence in line with theoretical predictions. Together, these results suggest that multi-turn drift can be understood as a controllable equilibrium phenomenon rather than as inevitable decay, providing a foundation for studying and mitigating context drift in extended interactions.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) to couple perception with robotic control, offering a promising path toward general-purpose embodied intelligence. However, current SOTA VLAs are primarily pretrained on multimodal tasks with limited relevance to embodied scenarios, and then finetuned to map explicit instructions to actions. Consequently, due to the lack of reasoning-intensive pretraining and reasoning-guided manipulation, these models are unable to perform implicit human intention reasoning required for complex, real-world interactions. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{IntentionVLA}, a VLA framework with a curriculum training paradigm and an efficient inference mechanism. Our proposed method first leverages carefully designed reasoning data that combine intention inference, spatial grounding, and compact embodied reasoning, endowing the model with both reasoning and perception capabilities. In the following finetuning stage, IntentionVLA employs the compact reasoning outputs as contextual guidance for action generation, enabling fast inference under indirect instructions. Experimental results show that IntentionVLA substantially outperforms $\pi_0$, achieving 18\% higher success rates with direct instructions and 28\% higher than ECoT under intention instructions. On out-of-distribution intention tasks, IntentionVLA achieves over twice the success rate of all baselines, and further enables zero-shot human-robot interaction with 40\% success rate. These results highlight IntentionVLA as a promising paradigm for next-generation human-robot interaction (HRI) systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and emerging agentic frameworks are beginning to transform single-cell biology by enabling natural-language reasoning, generative annotation, and multimodal data integration. However, progress remains fragmented across data modalities, architectures, and evaluation standards. LLM4Cell presents the first unified survey of 58 foundation and agentic models developed for single-cell research, spanning RNA, ATAC, multi-omic, and spatial modalities. We categorize these methods into five families-foundation, text-bridge, spatial, multimodal, epigenomic, and agentic-and map them to eight key analytical tasks including annotation, trajectory and perturbation modeling, and drug-response prediction. Drawing on over 40 public datasets, we analyze benchmark suitability, data diversity, and ethical or scalability constraints, and evaluate models across 10 domain dimensions covering biological grounding, multi-omics alignment, fairness, privacy, and explainability. By linking datasets, models, and evaluation domains, LLM4Cell provides the first integrated view of language-driven single-cell intelligence and outlines open challenges in interpretability, standardization, and trustworthy model development.

Abstract: Agentic RAG is a powerful technique for incorporating external information that LLMs lack, enabling better problem solving and question answering. However, suboptimal search behaviors exist widely, such as over-search (retrieving information already known) and under-search (failing to search when necessary), which leads to unnecessary overhead and unreliable outputs. Current training methods, which typically rely on outcome-based rewards in a RL framework, lack the fine-grained control needed to address these inefficiencies. To overcome this, we introduce Hierarchical Process Rewards for Efficient agentic RAG (HiPRAG), a training methodology that incorporates a fine-grained, knowledge-grounded process reward into the RL training. Our approach evaluates the necessity of each search decision on-the-fly by decomposing the agent's reasoning trajectory into discrete, parsable steps. We then apply a hierarchical reward function that provides an additional bonus based on the proportion of optimal search and non-search steps, on top of commonly used outcome and format rewards. Experiments on the Qwen2.5 and Llama-3.2 models across seven diverse QA benchmarks show that our method achieves average accuracies of 65.4% (3B) and 67.2% (7B). This is accomplished while improving search efficiency, reducing the over-search rate to just 2.3% and concurrently lowering the under-search rate. These results demonstrate the efficacy of optimizing the reasoning process itself, not just the final outcome. Further experiments and analysis demonstrate that HiPRAG shows good generalizability across a wide range of RL algorithms, model families, sizes, and types. This work demonstrates the importance and potential of fine-grained control through RL, for improving the efficiency and optimality of reasoning for search agents.

Abstract: The efficiency of multi-agent systems driven by large language models (LLMs) largely hinges on their communication topology. However, designing an optimal topology is a non-trivial challenge, as it requires balancing competing objectives such as task performance, communication cost, and robustness. Existing frameworks often rely on static or hand-crafted topologies, which inherently fail to adapt to diverse task requirements, leading to either excessive token consumption for simple problems or performance bottlenecks for complex ones. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel generative framework called \textit{Guided Topology Diffusion (GTD)}. Inspired by conditional discrete graph diffusion models, GTD formulates topology synthesis as an iterative construction process. At each step, the generation is steered by a lightweight proxy model that predicts multi-objective rewards (e.g., accuracy, utility, cost), enabling real-time, gradient-free optimization towards task-adaptive topologies. This iterative, guided synthesis process distinguishes GTD from single-step generative frameworks, enabling it to better navigate complex design trade-offs. We validated GTD across multiple benchmarks, and experiments show that this framework can generate highly task-adaptive, sparse, and efficient communication topologies, significantly outperforming existing methods in LLM agent collaboration.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) enable autonomous mobile agents to operate smartphone user interfaces, yet vulnerabilities to UI-level attacks remain critically understudied. Existing research often depends on conspicuous UI overlays, elevated permissions, or impractical threat models, limiting stealth and real-world applicability. In this paper, we present a practical and stealthy one-shot jailbreak attack that leverages in-app prompt injections: malicious applications embed short prompts in UI text that remain inert during human interaction but are revealed when an agent drives the UI via ADB (Android Debug Bridge). Our framework comprises three crucial components: (1) low-privilege perception-chain targeting, which injects payloads into malicious apps as the agent's visual inputs; (2) stealthy user-invisible activation, a touch-based trigger that discriminates agent from human touches using physical touch attributes and exposes the payload only during agent operation; and (3) one-shot prompt efficacy, a heuristic-guided, character-level iterative-deepening search algorithm (HG-IDA*) that performs one-shot, keyword-level detoxification to evade on-device safety filters. We evaluate across multiple LVLM backends, including closed-source services and representative open-source models within three Android applications, and we observe high planning and execution hijack rates in single-shot scenarios (e.g., GPT-4o: 82.5% planning / 75.0% execution). These findings expose a fundamental security vulnerability in current mobile agents with immediate implications for autonomous smartphone operation.

Abstract: The undesired memorization of sensitive information by Large Language Models (LLMs) has emphasized the need for safety mechanisms that can regulate model behavior. This has led to the development of machine unlearning techniques that enable models to precisely forget sensitive and unwanted information. For machine unlearning, first-order and second-order optimizer-based methods have shown significant progress in enabling LLMs to forget targeted information. However, in doing so, these approaches often compromise the model's original capabilities, resulting in unlearned models that struggle to retain their prior knowledge and overall utility. To address this, we propose Selective Influence Machine Unlearning (SIMU), a two-step framework that enhances second-order optimizer-based unlearning by selectively updating only the critical neurons responsible for encoding the forget-set. By constraining updates to these targeted neurons, SIMU achieves comparable unlearning efficacy while substantially outperforming current methods in retaining the model's original knowledge.

Abstract: In the Generative Age, the nature of knowledge work is transforming. Traditional models that emphasise the organisation and retrieval of pre-existing information are increasingly inadequate in the face of generative AI (GenAI) systems capable of autonomous content creation. This paper introduces the Knowledge Sculptor (KS), a new professional archetype for Human-GenAI collaboration that transforms raw AI output into trustworthy, actionable knowledge. Grounded in a socio-technical perspective, the KS is conceptualised through a framework of competencies, including architecting a vision, iterative dialogue, information sculpting, and curiosity-driven synthesis. A practice-based vignette illustrates the KS role in action, and in a self-referential approach, the paper itself serves as an artefact of the sculpting process it describes.

<title>MetaDefense: Defending Finetuning-based Jailbreak Attack Before and During Generation</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces MetaDefense, a novel framework for defending against finetuning-based jailbreak attacks in large language models (LLMs). We observe that existing defense mechanisms fail to generalize to harmful queries disguised by unseen attack templates, despite LLMs being capable of distinguishing disguised harmful queries in the embedding space. Based on these insights, we propose a two-stage defense approach: (i) pre-generation defense that detects harmful queries before response generation begins, and (ii) mid-generation defense that monitors partial responses during generation to prevent outputting more harmful content. Our MetaDefense trains the LLM to predict the harmfulness of both queries and partial responses using specialized prompts, enabling early termination of potentially harmful interactions. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures (LLaMA-2-7B, Qwen-2.5-3B-Instruct, and LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct) demonstrate that MetaDefense significantly outperforms existing defense mechanisms, achieving robust defense against harmful queries with seen and unseen attack templates while maintaining competitive performance on benign tasks.

<title>Self-Improving LLM Agents at Test-Time</title>

Abstract: One paradigm of language model (LM) fine-tuning relies on creating large training datasets, under the assumption that high quantity and diversity will enable models to generalize to novel tasks after post-training. In practice, gathering large sets of data is inefficient, and training on them is prohibitively expensive; worse, there is no guarantee that the resulting model will handle complex scenarios or generalize better. Moreover, existing techniques rarely assess whether a training sample provides novel information or is redundant with the knowledge already acquired by the model, resulting in unnecessary costs. In this work, we explore a new test-time self-improvement method to create more effective and generalizable agentic LMs on-the-fly. The proposed algorithm can be summarized in three steps: (i) first it identifies the samples that model struggles with (self-awareness), (ii) then generates similar examples from detected uncertain samples (self-data augmentation), and (iii) uses these newly generated samples at test-time fine-tuning (self-improvement). We study two variants of this approach: Test-Time Self-Improvement (TT-SI), where the same model generates additional training examples from its own uncertain cases and then learns from them, and contrast this approach with Test-Time Distillation (TT-D), where a stronger model generates similar examples for uncertain cases, enabling student to adapt using distilled supervision. Empirical evaluations across different agent benchmarks demonstrate that TT-SI improves the performance with +5.48% absolute accuracy gain on average across all benchmarks and surpasses other standard learning methods, yet using 68x less training samples. Our findings highlight the promise of TT-SI, demonstrating the potential of self-improvement algorithms at test-time as a new paradigm for building more capable agents toward self-evolution.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are crucial for applications with strict latency and computational constraints, yet achieving high performance remains challenging. Knowledge distillation (KD) can transfer capabilities from large teacher models, but existing methods involve trade-offs: off-policy distillation provides high-quality supervision but introduces a training-inference mismatch, while on-policy approaches maintain consistency but rely on low-quality student outputs. To address these issues, we propose AdaSwitch, a novel approach that dynamically combines on-policy and off-policy generation at the token level. AdaSwitch allows the student to first explore its own predictions and then selectively integrate teacher guidance based on real-time quality assessment. This approach simultaneously preserves consistency and maintains supervision quality. Experiments on three datasets with two teacher-student LLM pairs demonstrate that AdaSwitch consistently improves accuracy, offering a practical and effective method for distilling SLMs with acceptable additional overhead.

<title>Meta-Learning Based Few-Shot Graph-Level Anomaly Detection</title>

Abstract: Graph-level anomaly detection aims to identify anomalous graphs or subgraphs within graph datasets, playing a vital role in various fields such as fraud detection, review classification, and biochemistry. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have made significant progress in this domain, existing methods rely heavily on large amounts of labeled data, which is often unavailable in real-world scenarios. Additionally, few-shot anomaly detection methods based on GNNs are prone to noise interference, resulting in poor embedding quality and reduced model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose a novel meta-learning-based graph-level anomaly detection framework (MA-GAD), incorporating a graph compression module that reduces the graph size, mitigating noise interference while retaining essential node information. We also leverage meta-learning to extract meta-anomaly information from similar networks, enabling the learning of an initialization model that can rapidly adapt to new tasks with limited samples. This improves the anomaly detection performance on target graphs, and a bias network is used to enhance the distinction between anomalous and normal nodes. Our experimental results, based on four real-world biochemical datasets, demonstrate that MA-GAD outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in graph-level anomaly detection under few-shot conditions. Experiments on both graph anomaly and subgraph anomaly detection tasks validate the framework's effectiveness on real-world datasets.

Abstract: High-throughput toxicity testing offers a fast and cost-effective way to test large amounts of compounds. A key component for such systems is the automated evaluation via machine learning models. In this paper, we address critical challenges in this domain and demonstrate how representations learned via self-supervised learning can effectively identify toxicant-induced changes. We provide a proof-of-concept that utilizes the publicly available EmbryoNet dataset, which contains ten zebrafish embryo phenotypes elicited by various chemical compounds targeting different processes in early embryonic development. Our analysis shows that the learned representations using self-supervised learning are suitable for effectively distinguishing between the modes-of-action of different compounds. Finally, we discuss the integration of machine learning models in a physical toxicity testing device in the context of the TOXBOX project.

<title>DM1: MeanFlow with Dispersive Regularization for 1-Step Robotic Manipulation</title>

Abstract: The ability to learn multi-modal action distributions is indispensable for robotic manipulation policies to perform precise and robust control. Flow-based generative models have recently emerged as a promising solution to learning distributions of actions, offering one-step action generation and thus achieving much higher sampling efficiency compared to diffusion-based methods. However, existing flow-based policies suffer from representation collapse, the inability to distinguish similar visual representations, leading to failures in precise manipulation tasks. We propose DM1 (MeanFlow with Dispersive Regularization for One-Step Robotic Manipulation), a novel flow matching framework that integrates dispersive regularization into MeanFlow to prevent collapse while maintaining one-step efficiency. DM1 employs multiple dispersive regularization variants across different intermediate embedding layers, encouraging diverse representations across training batches without introducing additional network modules or specialized training procedures. Experiments on RoboMimic benchmarks show that DM1 achieves 20-40 times faster inference (0.07s vs. 2-3.5s) and improves success rates by 10-20 percentage points, with the Lift task reaching 99% success over 85% of the baseline. Real-robot deployment on a Franka Panda further validates that DM1 transfers effectively from simulation to the physical world. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage representation regularization to enable flow-based policies to achieve strong performance in robotic manipulation, establishing a simple yet powerful approach for efficient and robust manipulation.

Abstract: In this report, we describe the technical details of our submission to the IROS 2025 RoboSense Challenge Social Navigation Track. This track focuses on developing RGBD-based perception and navigation systems that enable autonomous agents to navigate safely, efficiently, and socially compliantly in dynamic human-populated indoor environments. The challenge requires agents to operate from an egocentric perspective using only onboard sensors including RGB-D observations and odometry, without access to global maps or privileged information, while maintaining social norm compliance such as safe distances and collision avoidance. Building upon the Falcon model, we introduce a Proactive Risk Perception Module to enhance social navigation performance. Our approach augments Falcon with collision risk understanding that learns to predict distance-based collision risk scores for surrounding humans, which enables the agent to develop more robust spatial awareness and proactive collision avoidance behaviors. The evaluation on the Social-HM3D benchmark demonstrates that our method improves the agent's ability to maintain personal space compliance while navigating toward goals in crowded indoor scenes with dynamic human agents, achieving 2nd place among 16 participating teams in the challenge.

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization provides a promising paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) by training stronger models on samples from aligned weaker ones, without requiring human feedback or explicit reward modeling. However, its robustness and generalization are hindered by the noise and biases in weak-model outputs, which limit its applicability in practice. To address this challenge, we leverage implicit rewards, which approximate explicit rewards through log-likelihood ratios, and reveal their structural equivalence with Contrastive Decoding (CD), a decoding strategy shown to reduce noise in LLM generation. Building on this connection, we propose Contrastive Weak-to-Strong Generalization (ConG), a framework that employs contrastive decoding between pre- and post-alignment weak models to generate higher-quality samples. This approach enables more reliable capability transfer, denoising, and improved robustness, substantially mitigating the limitations of traditional weak-to-strong methods. Empirical results across different model families confirm consistent improvements, demonstrating the generality and effectiveness of ConG. Taken together, our findings highlight the potential of ConG to advance weak-to-strong generalization and provide a promising pathway toward AGI.

Abstract: Drug recommendation is an essential task in machine learning-based clinical decision support systems. However, the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDI) between co-prescribed medications remains a significant challenge. Previous studies have used graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent drug structures. Regardless, their simplified discrete forms cannot fully capture the molecular binding affinity and reactivity. Therefore, we propose Multimodal DDI Prediction with Molecular Electron Localization Function (ELF) Maps (MMM), a novel framework that integrates three-dimensional (3D) quantum-chemical information into drug representation learning. It generates 3D electron density maps using the ELF. To capture both therapeutic relevance and interaction risks, MMM combines ELF-derived features that encode global electronic properties with a bipartite graph encoder that models local substructure interactions. This design enables learning complementary characteristics of drug molecules. We evaluate MMM in the MIMIC-III dataset (250 drugs, 442 substructures), comparing it with several baseline models. In particular, a comparison with the GNN-based SafeDrug model demonstrates statistically significant improvements in the F1-score (p = 0.0387), Jaccard (p = 0.0112), and the DDI rate (p = 0.0386). These results demonstrate the potential of ELF-based 3D representations to enhance prediction accuracy and support safer combinatorial drug prescribing in clinical practice.

<title>Towards Human-Like Grading: A Unified LLM-Enhanced Framework for Subjective Question Evaluation</title>

Abstract: Automatic grading of subjective questions remains a significant challenge in examination assessment due to the diversity in question formats and the open-ended nature of student responses. Existing works primarily focus on a specific type of subjective question and lack the generality to support comprehensive exams that contain diverse question types. In this paper, we propose a unified Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced auto-grading framework that provides human-like evaluation for all types of subjective questions across various domains. Our framework integrates four complementary modules to holistically evaluate student answers. In addition to a basic text matching module that provides a foundational assessment of content similarity, we leverage the powerful reasoning and generative capabilities of LLMs to: (1) compare key knowledge points extracted from both student and reference answers, (2) generate a pseudo-question from the student answer to assess its relevance to the original question, and (3) simulate human evaluation by identifying content-related and non-content strengths and weaknesses. Extensive experiments on both general-purpose and domain-specific datasets show that our framework consistently outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines across multiple grading metrics. Moreover, the proposed system has been successfully deployed in real-world training and certification exams at a major e-commerce enterprise.

Abstract: Answering complex real-world questions requires step-by-step retrieval and integration of relevant information to generate well-grounded responses. However, existing knowledge distillation methods overlook the need for different reasoning abilities at different steps, hindering transfer in multi-step retrieval-augmented frameworks. To address this, we propose Stepwise Knowledge Distillation for Enhancing Reasoning Ability in Multi-Step Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (StepER). StepER employs step-wise supervision to align with evolving information and reasoning demands across stages. Additionally, it incorporates difficulty-aware training to progressively optimize learning by prioritizing suitable steps. Our method is adaptable to various multi-step retrieval-augmented language models, including those that use retrieval queries for reasoning paths or decomposed questions. Extensive experiments show that StepER outperforms prior methods on multi-hop QA benchmarks, with an 8B model achieving performance comparable to a 70B teacher model.

Abstract: Video Foundation Models (VFMs) exhibit remarkable visual generation performance, but struggle in compositional scenarios (e.g., motion, numeracy, and spatial relation). In this work, we introduce Test-Time Optimization and Memorization (TTOM), a training-free framework that aligns VFM outputs with spatiotemporal layouts during inference for better text-image alignment. Rather than direct intervention to latents or attention per-sample in existing work, we integrate and optimize new parameters guided by a general layout-attention objective. Furthermore, we formulate video generation within a streaming setting, and maintain historical optimization contexts with a parametric memory mechanism that supports flexible operations, such as insert, read, update, and delete. Notably, we found that TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge, showing powerful transferability and generalization. Experimental results on the T2V-CompBench and Vbench benchmarks establish TTOM as an effective, practical, scalable, and efficient framework to achieve cross-modal alignment for compositional video generation on the fly.

Abstract: Current text detection datasets primarily target natural or document scenes, where text typically appear in regular font and shapes, monotonous colors, and orderly layouts. The text usually arranged along straight or curved lines. However, these characteristics differ significantly from anime scenes, where text is often diverse in style, irregularly arranged, and easily confused with complex visual elements such as symbols and decorative patterns. Text in anime scene also includes a large number of handwritten and stylized fonts. Motivated by this gap, we introduce AnimeText, a large-scale dataset containing 735K images and 4.2M annotated text blocks. It features hierarchical annotations and hard negative samples tailored for anime scenarios. %Cross-dataset evaluations using state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that models trained on AnimeText achieve superior performance in anime text detection tasks compared to existing datasets. To evaluate the robustness of AnimeText in complex anime scenes, we conducted cross-dataset benchmarking using state-of-the-art text detection methods. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained on AnimeText outperform those trained on existing datasets in anime scene text detection tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) have led to strong performance in open-domain question answering (QA). However, existing models still struggle with questions that admit multiple valid answers. Standard QA benchmarks, which typically assume a single gold answer, overlook this reality and thus produce inappropriate training signals. Existing attempts to handle ambiguity often rely on costly manual annotation, which is difficult to scale to multi-hop datasets such as HotpotQA and MuSiQue. In this paper, we present A$^2$Search, an annotation-free, end-to-end training framework to recognize and handle ambiguity. At its core is an automated pipeline that detects ambiguous questions and gathers alternative answers via trajectory sampling and evidence verification. The model is then optimized with RL using a carefully designed $\mathrm{AnsF1}$ reward, which naturally accommodates multiple answers. Experiments on eight open-domain QA benchmarks demonstrate that A$^2$Search achieves new state-of-the-art performance. With only a single rollout, A$^2$Search-7B yields an average $\mathrm{AnsF1}@1$ score of $48.4\%$ across four multi-hop benchmarks, outperforming all strong baselines, including the substantially larger ReSearch-32B ($46.2\%$). Extensive analyses further show that A$^2$Search resolves ambiguity and generalizes across benchmarks, highlighting that embracing ambiguity is essential for building more reliable QA systems.

Abstract: Evaluating modern machine learning models has become prohibitively expensive. Benchmarks such as LMMs-Eval and HELM demand thousands of GPU hours per model. Costly evaluation reduces inclusivity, slows the cycle of innovation, and worsens environmental impact. The typical approach follows two steps. First, select an anchor subset of data. Second, train a mapping from the accuracy on this subset to the final test result. The drawback is that anchor selection depends on clustering, which can be complex and sensitive to design choices. We argue that promoting diversity among samples is not essential; what matters is to select samples that $\textit{maximise diversity in model responses}$. Our method, $\textbf{Diversifying Sample Condensation (DISCO)}$, selects the top-k samples with the greatest model disagreements. This uses greedy, sample-wise statistics rather than global clustering. The approach is conceptually simpler. From a theoretical view, inter-model disagreement provides an information-theoretically optimal rule for such greedy selection. $\textbf{DISCO}$ shows empirical gains over prior methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in performance prediction across MMLU, Hellaswag, Winogrande, and ARC.

Abstract: Wearable EEG devices have emerged as a promising alternative to polysomnography (PSG). As affordable and scalable solutions, their widespread adoption results in the collection of massive volumes of unlabeled data that cannot be analyzed by clinicians at scale. Meanwhile, the recent success of deep learning for sleep scoring has relied on large annotated datasets. Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers an opportunity to bridge this gap, leveraging unlabeled signals to address label scarcity and reduce annotation effort. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of SSL for sleep staging using wearable EEG. We investigate a range of well-established SSL methods and evaluate them on two sleep databases acquired with the Ikon Sleep wearable EEG headband: BOAS, a high-quality benchmark containing PSG and wearable EEG recordings with consensus labels, and HOGAR, a large collection of home-based, self-recorded, and unlabeled recordings. Three evaluation scenarios are defined to study label efficiency, representation quality, and cross-dataset generalization. Results show that SSL consistently improves classification performance by up to 10% over supervised baselines, with gains particularly evident when labeled data is scarce. SSL achieves clinical-grade accuracy above 80% leveraging only 5% to 10% of labeled data, while the supervised approach requires twice the labels. Additionally, SSL representations prove robust to variations in population characteristics, recording environments, and signal quality. Our findings demonstrate the potential of SSL to enable label-efficient sleep staging with wearable EEG, reducing reliance on manual annotations and advancing the development of affordable sleep monitoring systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in reasoning, often through supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, SFT is resource-intensive, relying on large curated datasets, rejection-sampled demonstrations, and uniform optimization across all tokens, even though only a fraction carry meaningful learning value. In this work, we explore a counterintuitive idea: can smaller language models (SLMs) teach larger language models (LLMs) by revealing high-value reasoning moments that reflect the latter's unique strength? We propose LightReasoner, a novel framework that leverages the behavioral divergence between a stronger expert model (LLM) and a weaker amateur model (SLM). LightReasoner operates in two stages: (1) a sampling stage that pinpoints critical reasoning moments and constructs supervision examples capturing the expert's advantage through expert-amateur contrast, and (2) a fine-tuning stage that aligns the expert model with these distilled examples, amplifying its reasoning strengths. Across seven mathematical benchmarks, LightReasoner improves accuracy by up to 28.1%, while reducing time consumption by 90%, sampled problems by 80%, and tuned token usage by 99%, all without relying on ground-truth labels. By turning weaker SLMs into effective teaching signals, LightReasoner offers a scalable and resource-efficient approach for advancing LLM reasoning.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel in mathematical and code reasoning, we observe they struggle with social reasoning tasks, exhibiting cognitive confusion, logical inconsistencies, and conflation between objective world states and subjective belief states. Through deteiled analysis of DeepSeek-R1's reasoning trajectories, we find that LLMs frequently encounter reasoning impasses and tend to output contradictory terms like "tricky" and "confused" when processing scenarios with multiple participants and timelines, leading to erroneous reasoning or infinite loops. The core issue is their inability to disentangle objective reality from agents' subjective beliefs. To address this, we propose an adaptive world model-enhanced reasoning mechanism that constructs a dynamic textual world model to track entity states and temporal sequences. It dynamically monitors reasoning trajectories for confusion indicators and promptly intervenes by providing clear world state descriptions, helping models navigate through cognitive dilemmas. The mechanism mimics how humans use implicit world models to distinguish between external events and internal beliefs. Evaluations on three social benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy (e.g., +10% in Hi-ToM) while reducing computational costs (up to 33.8% token reduction), offering a simple yet effective solution for deploying LLMs in social contexts.

Abstract: Enabling robots to perform precise and generalized manipulation in unstructured environments remains a fundamental challenge in embodied AI. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in semantic reasoning and task planning, a significant gap persists between their high-level understanding and the precise physical execution required for real-world manipulation. To bridge this "semantic-to-physical" gap, we introduce GRACE, a novel framework that grounds VLM-based reasoning through executable analytic concepts (EAC)-mathematically defined blueprints that encode object affordances, geometric constraints, and semantics of manipulation. Our approach integrates a structured policy scaffolding pipeline that turn natural language instructions and visual information into an instantiated EAC, from which we derive grasp poses, force directions and plan physically feasible motion trajectory for robot execution. GRACE thus provides a unified and interpretable interface between high-level instruction understanding and low-level robot control, effectively enabling precise and generalizable manipulation through semantic-physical grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRACE achieves strong zero-shot generalization across a variety of articulated objects in both simulated and real-world environments, without requiring task-specific training.

<title>Unveiling the Power of Multiple Gossip Steps: A Stability-Based Generalization Analysis in Decentralized Training</title>

Abstract: Decentralized training removes the centralized server, making it a communication-efficient approach that can significantly improve training efficiency, but it often suffers from degraded performance compared to centralized training. Multi-Gossip Steps (MGS) serve as a simple yet effective bridge between decentralized and centralized training, significantly reducing experiment performance gaps. However, the theoretical reasons for its effectiveness and whether this gap can be fully eliminated by MGS remain open questions. In this paper, we derive upper bounds on the generalization error and excess error of MGS using stability analysis, systematically answering these two key questions. 1). Optimization Error Reduction: MGS reduces the optimization error bound at an exponential rate, thereby exponentially tightening the generalization error bound and enabling convergence to better solutions. 2). Gap to Centralization: Even as MGS approaches infinity, a non-negligible gap in generalization error remains compared to centralized mini-batch SGD ($\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{c\beta}{c\beta +1}}/{n m})$ in centralized and $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{2c\beta}{2c\beta +2}}/{n m^{\frac{1}{2c\beta +2}}})$ in decentralized). Furthermore, we provide the first unified analysis of how factors like learning rate, data heterogeneity, node count, per-node sample size, and communication topology impact the generalization of MGS under non-convex settings without the bounded gradients assumption, filling a critical theoretical gap in decentralized training. Finally, promising experiments on CIFAR datasets support our theoretical findings.

<title>ZeroCard: Cardinality Estimation with Zero Dependence on Target Databases -- No Data, No Query, No Retraining</title>

Abstract: Cardinality estimation is a fundamental task in database systems and plays a critical role in query optimization. Despite significant advances in learning-based cardinality estimation methods, most existing approaches remain difficult to generalize to new datasets due to their strong dependence on raw data or queries, thus limiting their practicality in real scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we argue that semantics in the schema may benefit cardinality estimation, and leveraging such semantics may alleviate these dependencies. To this end, we introduce ZeroCard, the first semantics-driven cardinality estimation method that can be applied without any dependence on raw data access, query logs, or retraining on the target database. Specifically, we propose to predict data distributions using schema semantics, thereby avoiding raw data dependence. Then, we introduce a query template-agnostic representation method to alleviate query dependence. Finally, we construct a large-scale query dataset derived from real-world tables and pretrain ZeroCard on it, enabling it to learn cardinality from schema semantics and predicate representations. After pretraining, ZeroCard's parameters can be frozen and applied in an off-the-shelf manner. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the distinct advantages of ZeroCard and show its practical applications in query optimization. Its zero-dependence property significantly facilitates deployment in real-world scenarios.

<title>Is Architectural Complexity Always the Answer? A Case Study on SwinIR vs. an Efficient CNN</title>

Abstract: The simultaneous restoration of high-frequency details and suppression of severe noise in low-light imagery presents a significant and persistent challenge in computer vision. While large-scale Transformer models like SwinIR have set the state of the art in performance, their high computational cost can be a barrier for practical applications. This paper investigates the critical trade-off between performance and efficiency by comparing the state-of-the-art SwinIR model against a standard, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on this challenging task. Our experimental results reveal a nuanced but important finding. While the Transformer-based SwinIR model achieves a higher peak performance, with a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 39.03 dB, the lightweight CNN delivers a surprisingly competitive PSNR of 37.4 dB. Crucially, the CNN reached this performance after converging in only 10 epochs of training, whereas the more complex SwinIR model required 132 epochs. This efficiency is further underscored by the model's size; the CNN is over 55 times smaller than SwinIR. This work demonstrates that a standard CNN can provide a near state-of-the-art result with significantly lower computational overhead, presenting a compelling case for its use in real-world scenarios where resource constraints are a primary concern.

<title>Fewer Weights, More Problems: A Practical Attack on LLM Pruning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07985</link>

Abstract: Model pruning, i.e., removing a subset of model weights, has become a prominent approach to reducing the memory footprint of large language models (LLMs) during inference. Notably, popular inference engines, such as vLLM, enable users to conveniently prune downloaded models before they are deployed. While the utility and efficiency of pruning methods have improved significantly, the security implications of pruning remain underexplored. In this work, for the first time, we show that modern LLM pruning methods can be maliciously exploited. In particular, an adversary can construct a model that appears benign yet, once pruned, exhibits malicious behaviors. Our method is based on the idea that the adversary can compute a proxy metric that estimates how likely each parameter is to be pruned. With this information, the adversary can first inject a malicious behavior into those parameters that are unlikely to be pruned. Then, they can repair the model by using parameters that are likely to be pruned, effectively canceling out the injected behavior in the unpruned model. We demonstrate the severity of our attack through extensive evaluation on five models; after any of the pruning in vLLM are applied (Magnitude, Wanda, and SparseGPT), it consistently exhibits strong malicious behaviors in a diverse set of attack scenarios (success rates of up to $95.7\%$ for jailbreak, $98.7\%$ for benign instruction refusal, and $99.5\%$ for targeted content injection). Our results reveal a critical deployment-time security gap and underscore the urgent need for stronger security awareness in model compression.

Abstract: Scientific figure captions require both accuracy and stylistic consistency to convey visual information. Here, we present a domain-specific caption generation system for the 3rd SciCap Challenge that integrates figure-related textual context with author-specific writing styles using the LaMP-Cap dataset. Our approach uses a two-stage pipeline: Stage 1 combines context filtering, category-specific prompt optimization via DSPy's MIPROv2 and SIMBA, and caption candidate selection; Stage 2 applies few-shot prompting with profile figures for stylistic refinement. Our experiments demonstrate that category-specific prompts outperform both zero-shot and general optimized approaches, improving ROUGE-1 recall by +8.3\% while limiting precision loss to -2.8\% and BLEU-4 reduction to -10.9\%. Profile-informed stylistic refinement yields 40--48\% gains in BLEU scores and 25--27\% in ROUGE. Overall, our system demonstrates that combining contextual understanding with author-specific stylistic adaptation can generate captions that are both scientifically accurate and stylistically faithful to the source paper.

<title>Learning on the Job: An Experience-Driven Self-Evolving Agent for Long-Horizon Tasks</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, yet significant challenges persist when deploying them as AI agents for real-world long-horizon tasks. Existing LLM agents suffer from a critical limitation: they are test-time static and cannot learn from experience, lacking the ability to accumulate knowledge and continuously improve on the job. To address this challenge, we propose MUSE, a novel agent framework that introduces an experience-driven, self-evolving system centered around a hierarchical Memory Module. MUSE organizes diverse levels of experience and leverages them to plan and execute long-horizon tasks across multiple applications. After each sub-task execution, the agent autonomously reflects on its trajectory, converting the raw trajectory into structured experience and integrating it back into the Memory Module. This mechanism enables the agent to evolve beyond its static pretrained parameters, fostering continuous learning and self-evolution. We evaluate MUSE on the long-horizon productivity benchmark TAC. It achieves new SOTA performance by a significant margin using only a lightweight Gemini-2.5 Flash model. Sufficient Experiments demonstrate that as the agent autonomously accumulates experience, it exhibits increasingly superior task completion capabilities, as well as robust continuous learning and self-evolution capabilities. Moreover, the accumulated experience from MUSE exhibits strong generalization properties, enabling zero-shot improvement on new tasks. MUSE establishes a new paradigm for AI agents capable of real-world productivity task automation.

<title>Past, Present, and Future of Bug Tracking in the Generative AI Era</title>

Abstract: Traditional bug tracking systems rely heavily on manual reporting, reproduction, triaging, and resolution, each carried out by different stakeholders such as end users, customer support, developers, and testers. This division of responsibilities requires significant coordination and widens the communication gap between non-technical users and technical teams, slowing the process from bug discovery to resolution. Moreover, current systems are highly asynchronous; users often wait hours or days for a first response, delaying fixes and contributing to frustration. This paper examines the evolution of bug tracking, from early paper-based reporting to today's web-based and SaaS platforms. Building on this trajectory, we propose an AI-powered bug tracking framework that augments existing tools with intelligent, large language model (LLM)-driven automation. Our framework addresses two main challenges: reducing time-to-fix and minimizing human overhead. Users report issues in natural language, while AI agents refine reports, attempt reproduction, and request missing details. Reports are then classified, invalid ones resolved through no-code fixes, and valid ones localized and assigned to developers. LLMs also generate candidate patches, with human oversight ensuring correctness. By integrating automation into each phase, our framework accelerates response times, improves collaboration, and strengthens software maintenance practices for a more efficient, user-centric future.

<title>Backdoor Vectors: a Task Arithmetic View on Backdoor Attacks and Defenses</title>

Abstract: Model merging (MM) recently emerged as an effective method for combining large deep learning models. However, it poses significant security risks. Recent research shows that it is highly susceptible to backdoor attacks, which introduce a hidden trigger into a single fine-tuned model instance that allows the adversary to control the output of the final merged model at inference time. In this work, we propose a simple framework for understanding backdoor attacks by treating the attack itself as a task vector. $Backdoor\ Vector\ (BV)$ is calculated as the difference between the weights of a fine-tuned backdoored model and fine-tuned clean model. BVs reveal new insights into attacks understanding and a more effective framework to measure their similarity and transferability. Furthermore, we propose a novel method that enhances backdoor resilience through merging dubbed $Sparse\ Backdoor\ Vector\ (SBV)$ that combines multiple attacks into a single one. We identify the core vulnerability behind backdoor threats in MM: $inherent\ triggers$ that exploit adversarial weaknesses in the base model. To counter this, we propose $Injection\ BV\ Subtraction\ (IBVS)$ - an assumption-free defense against backdoors in MM. Our results show that SBVs surpass prior attacks and is the first method to leverage merging to improve backdoor effectiveness. At the same time, IBVS provides a lightweight, general defense that remains effective even when the backdoor threat is entirely unknown.

Abstract: Data-driven robotic manipulation learning depends on large-scale, high-quality expert demonstration datasets. However, existing datasets, which primarily rely on human teleoperated robot collection, are limited in terms of scalability, trajectory smoothness, and applicability across different robotic embodiments in real-world environments. In this paper, we present FastUMI-100K, a large-scale UMI-style multimodal demonstration dataset, designed to overcome these limitations and meet the growing complexity of real-world manipulation tasks. Collected by FastUMI, a novel robotic system featuring a modular, hardware-decoupled mechanical design and an integrated lightweight tracking system, FastUMI-100K offers a more scalable, flexible, and adaptable solution to fulfill the diverse requirements of real-world robot demonstration data. Specifically, FastUMI-100K contains over 100K+ demonstration trajectories collected across representative household environments, covering 54 tasks and hundreds of object types. Our dataset integrates multimodal streams, including end-effector states, multi-view wrist-mounted fisheye images and textual annotations. Each trajectory has a length ranging from 120 to 500 frames. Experimental results demonstrate that FastUMI-100K enables high policy success rates across various baseline algorithms, confirming its robustness, adaptability, and real-world applicability for solving complex, dynamic manipulation challenges. The source code and dataset will be released in this link https://github.com/MrKeee/FastUMI-100K.

Abstract: Background: We aimed to quantify hepatic vessel volumes across chronic liver disease stages and healthy controls using deep learning-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis, and assess correlations with biomarkers for liver (dys)function and fibrosis/portal hypertension.
  Methods: We assessed retrospectively healthy controls, non-advanced and advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD) patients using a 3D U-Net model for hepatic vessel segmentation on portal venous phase gadoxetic acid-enhanced 3-T MRI. Total (TVVR), hepatic (HVVR), and intrahepatic portal vein-to-volume ratios (PVVR) were compared between groups and correlated with: albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) and model for end-stage liver disease-sodium (MELD-Na) score, and fibrosis/portal hypertension (Fibrosis-4 [FIB-4] score, liver stiffness measurement [LSM], hepatic venous pressure gradient [HVPG], platelet count [PLT], and spleen volume).
  Results: We included 197 subjects, aged 54.9 $\pm$ 13.8 years (mean $\pm$ standard deviation), 111 males (56.3\%): 35 healthy controls, 44 non-ACLD, and 118 ACLD patients. TVVR and HVVR were highest in controls (3.9; 2.1), intermediate in non-ACLD (2.8; 1.7), and lowest in ACLD patients (2.3; 1.0) ($p \leq 0.001$). PVVR was reduced in both non-ACLD and ACLD patients (both 1.2) compared to controls (1.7) ($p \leq 0.001$), but showed no difference between CLD groups ($p = 0.999$). HVVR significantly correlated indirectly with FIB-4, ALBI, MELD-Na, LSM, and spleen volume ($\rho$ ranging from -0.27 to -0.40), and directly with PLT ($\rho = 0.36$). TVVR and PVVR showed similar but weaker correlations.
  Conclusions: Deep learning-based hepatic vessel volumetry demonstrated differences between healthy liver and chronic liver disease stages and shows correlations with established markers of disease severity.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate advanced reasoning abilities, enabling robots to understand natural language instructions and generate high-level plans with appropriate grounding. However, LLM hallucinations present a significant challenge, often leading to overconfident yet potentially misaligned or unsafe plans. While researchers have explored uncertainty estimation to improve the reliability of LLM-based planning, existing studies have not sufficiently differentiated between epistemic and intrinsic uncertainty, limiting the effectiveness of uncertainty esti- mation. In this paper, we present Combined Uncertainty estimation for Reliable Embodied planning (CURE), which decomposes the uncertainty into epistemic and intrinsic uncertainty, each estimated separately. Furthermore, epistemic uncertainty is subdivided into task clarity and task familiarity for more accurate evaluation. The overall uncertainty assessments are obtained using random network distillation and multi-layer perceptron regression heads driven by LLM features. We validated our approach in two distinct experimental settings: kitchen manipulation and tabletop rearrangement experiments. The results show that, compared to existing methods, our approach yields uncertainty estimates that are more closely aligned with the actual execution outcomes.

We provide a logical characterization and use it to prove that verification tasks for quantized GNNs with readout are (co)NEXPTIME-complete. This result implies that the verification of quantized GNNs is computationally intractable, prompting substantial research efforts toward ensuring the safety of GNN-based systems. We also experimentally demonstrate that quantized ACR-GNN models are lightweight while maintaining good accuracy and generalization capabilities with respect to non-quantized models.

Abstract: Query-product relevance prediction is fundamental to e-commerce search and has become even more critical in the era of AI-powered shopping, where semantic understanding and complex reasoning directly shape the user experience and business conversion. Large Language Models (LLMs) enable generative, reasoning-based approaches, typically aligned via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or preference optimization methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). However, the increasing complexity of business rules and user queries exposes the inability of existing methods to endow models with robust reasoning capacity for long-tail and challenging cases. Efforts to address this via reinforcement learning strategies like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) often suffer from sparse terminal rewards, offering insufficient guidance for multi-step reasoning and slowing convergence. To address these challenges, we propose TaoSR-AGRL, an Adaptive Guided Reinforcement Learning framework for LLM-based relevance prediction in Taobao Search Relevance. TaoSR-AGRL introduces two key innovations: (1) Rule-aware Reward Shaping, which decomposes the final relevance judgment into dense, structured rewards aligned with domain-specific relevance criteria; and (2) Adaptive Guided Replay, which identifies low-accuracy rollouts during training and injects targeted ground-truth guidance to steer the policy away from stagnant, rule-violating reasoning patterns toward compliant trajectories. TaoSR-AGRL was evaluated on large-scale real-world datasets and through online side-by-side human evaluations on Taobao Search. It consistently outperforms DPO and standard GRPO baselines in offline experiments, improving relevance accuracy, rule adherence, and training stability. The model trained with TaoSR-AGRL has been successfully deployed in the main search scenario on Taobao, serving hundreds of millions of users.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit advanced reasoning ability, conventional alignment remains largely dominated by outcome reward models (ORMs) that judge only final answers. Process Reward Models(PRMs) address this gap by evaluating and guiding reasoning at the step or trajectory level. This survey provides a systematic overview of PRMs through the full loop: how to generate process data, build PRMs, and use PRMs for test-time scaling and reinforcement learning. We summarize applications across math, code, text, multimodal reasoning, robotics, and agents, and review emerging benchmarks. Our goal is to clarify design spaces, reveal open challenges, and guide future research toward fine-grained, robust reasoning alignment.

Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, dialogue systems have become a prominent form of human-computer interaction. However, traditional centralized or fully local training approaches face challenges in balancing privacy preservation and personalization due to data privacy concerns and heterogeneous device capabilities. Federated learning, as a representative distributed paradigm, offers a promising solution. However, existing methods often suffer from overfitting under limited client data and tend to forget global information after multiple training rounds, leading to poor generalization. To address these issues, we propose FedDTRE, a Federated adaptive aggregation strategy for Dialogue generation based on Trustworthiness Evaluation. Instead of directly replacing local models with the global model, FedDTRE leverages trustworthiness scores of both global and local models on a fairness-oriented evaluation dataset to dynamically regulate the global model's contribution during local updates. Experimental results demonstrate that FedDTRE can improve dialogue model performance and enhance the quality of dialogue generation.

Abstract: The rise of AI-generated music is diluting royalty pools and revealing structural flaws in existing remuneration frameworks, challenging the well-established artist compensation systems in the music industry. Existing compensation solutions, such as piecemeal licensing agreements, lack scalability and technical rigour, while current data attribution mechanisms provide only uncertain estimates and are rarely implemented in practice. This paper introduces a framework for a generative music infrastructure centred on direct attribution, transparent royalty distribution, and granular control for artists and rights' holders. We distinguish ontologically between the training set and the inference set, which allows us to propose two complementary forms of attribution: training-time attribution and inference-time attribution. We here favour inference-time attribution, as it enables direct, verifiable compensation whenever an artist's catalogue is used to condition a generated output. Besides, users benefit from the ability to condition generations on specific songs and receive transparent information about attribution and permitted usage. Our approach offers an ethical and practical solution to the pressing need for robust compensation mechanisms in the era of AI-generated music, ensuring that provenance and fairness are embedded at the core of generative systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a Multi Agent Bitcoin Trading system that utilizes Large Lan- guage Models (LLMs) for alpha generation and portfolio management in the cryptocur- rencies market. Unlike equities, cryptocurrencies exhibit extreme volatility and are heavily influenced by rapidly shifting market sentiments and regulatory announcements, making them difficult to model using static regression models or neural networks trained solely on historical data [53]. The proposed framework overcomes this by structuring LLMs into specialised agents for technical analysis, sentiment evaluation, decision-making, and performance reflection. The system improves over time through a novel verbal feedback mechanism where a Reflect agent provides daily and weekly natural-language critiques of trading decisions. These textual evaluations are then injected into future prompts, al- lowing the system to adjust indicator priorities, sentiment weights, and allocation logic without parameter updates or finetuning. Back-testing on Bitcoin price data from July 2024 to April 2025 shows consistent outperformance across market regimes: the Quantita- tive agent delivered over 30% higher returns in bullish phases and 15% overall gains versus buy-and-hold, while the sentiment-driven agent turned sideways markets from a small loss into a gain of over 100%. Adding weekly feedback further improved total performance by 31% and reduced bearish losses by 10%. The results demonstrate that verbal feedback represents a new, scalable, and low-cost method of tuning LLMs for financial goals.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has transformed industries and daily life by enabling widespread connectivity and data exchange. However, this increased interconnection has introduced serious security vulnerabilities, making IoT systems more exposed to sophisticated cyber attacks.

Abstract: We investigate the degree to which human plausibility judgments of multiple-choice commonsense benchmark answers are subject to influence by (im)plausibility arguments for or against an answer, in particular, using rationales generated by LLMs. We collect 3,000 plausibility judgments from humans and another 13,600 judgments from LLMs. Overall, we observe increases and decreases in mean human plausibility ratings in the presence of LLM-generated PRO and CON rationales, respectively, suggesting that, on the whole, human judges find these rationales convincing. Experiments with LLMs reveal similar patterns of influence. Our findings demonstrate a novel use of LLMs for studying aspects of human cognition, while also raising practical concerns that, even in domains where humans are ``experts'' (i.e., common sense), LLMs have the potential to exert considerable influence on people's beliefs.

<title>The Price of Thought: A Multilingual Analysis of Reasoning, Performance, and Cost of Negotiation in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Negotiation is a fundamental challenge for AI agents, as it requires an ability to reason strategically, model opponents, and balance cooperation with competition. We conduct the first comprehensive study systematically evaluating the effect of (LLM-)reasoning on the negotiation abilities of both commercial and open-weight LLMs, and do this across three languages. Using a self-play setup across three diverse dialogue games, we analyse trade-offs between performance and cost, the language consistency of reasoning processes, and the nature of strategic adaptation exhibited by models. Our findings show that enabling reasoning-that is, scaling test time compute-significantly improves negotiation outcomes by enhancing collaboration and helping models overcome task complexities, but comes at a substantial computational cost: reasoning improves GPT-5's performance by 31.4 % while increasing its cost by nearly 400 %. Most critically, we uncover a significant multilingual reasoning distinction: open-weight models consistently switch to English for their internal reasoning steps, even when negotiating in German or Italian (and thus possibly impacting potential explainability gains through the disclosure of reasoning traces), while leading commercial models maintain language consistency between their reasoning and final output.

<title>Lossless Vocabulary Reduction for Auto-Regressive Language Models</title>

Abstract: Tokenization -- the process of decomposing a given text into a sequence of subwords called tokens -- is one of the key components in the development of language models. Particularly, auto-regressive language models generate texts token by token, i.e., by predicting the next-token distribution given the previous ones, and thus tokenization directly affects their efficiency in text generation. Since each language model has their own vocabulary as a set of possible tokens, they struggle to cooperate with each other at the level of next-token distributions such as model ensemble. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework of lossless vocabulary reduction, which efficiently converts a given auto-regressive language model into the one with an arbitrarily small vocabulary without any loss in accuracy. As an application, we demonstrate that language models with different tokenization can cooperate with each other efficiently through their maximal common vocabulary.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has become integral to organizational decision-making and while research has explored many facets of this human-AI collaboration, the focus has mainly been on designing the AI agent(s) and the way the collaboration is set up - generally assuming a human decision-maker to be "fixed". However, it has largely been neglected that decision-makers' mental models evolve through their continuous interaction with AI systems. This paper addresses this gap by conceptualizing how the design of human-AI collaboration influences the development of three complementary and interdependent mental models necessary for this collaboration. We develop an integrated socio-technical framework that identifies the mechanisms driving the mental model evolution: data contextualization, reasoning transparency, and performance feedback. Our work advances human-AI collaboration literature through three key contributions: introducing three distinct mental models (domain, information processing, complementarity-awareness); recognizing the dynamic nature of mental models; and establishing mechanisms that guide the purposeful design of effective human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems fail when documents evolve through versioning-a ubiquitous characteristic of technical documentation. Existing approaches achieve only 58-64% accuracy on version-sensitive questions, retrieving semantically similar content without temporal validity checks. We present VersionRAG, a version-aware RAG framework that explicitly models document evolution through a hierarchical graph structure capturing version sequences, content boundaries, and changes between document states. During retrieval, VersionRAG routes queries through specialized paths based on intent classification, enabling precise version-aware filtering and change tracking. On our VersionQA benchmark-100 manually curated questions across 34 versioned technical documents-VersionRAG achieves 90% accuracy, outperforming naive RAG (58%) and GraphRAG (64%). VersionRAG reaches 60% accuracy on implicit change detection where baselines fail (0-10%), demonstrating its ability to track undocumented modifications. Additionally, VersionRAG requires 97% fewer tokens during indexing than GraphRAG, making it practical for large-scale deployment. Our work establishes versioned document QA as a distinct task and provides both a solution and benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Complex learning agents are increasingly deployed alongside existing experts, such as human operators or previously trained agents. However, it remains unclear how should learners optimally incorporate certain forms of expert data, which may differ in structure from the learner's own action-outcome experiences. We study this problem in the context of Bayesian multi-armed bandits, considering: (i) offline settings, where the learner receives a dataset of outcomes from the expert's optimal policy before interaction, and (ii) simultaneous settings, where the learner must choose at each step whether to update its beliefs based on its own experience, or based on the outcome simultaneously achieved by an expert. We formalize how expert data influences the learner's posterior, and prove that pretraining on expert outcomes tightens information-theoretic regret bounds by the mutual information between the expert data and the optimal action. For the simultaneous setting, we propose an information-directed rule where the learner processes the data source that maximizes their one-step information gain about the optimal action. Finally, we propose strategies for how the learner can infer when to trust the expert and when not to, safeguarding the learner for the cases where the expert is ineffective or compromised. By quantifying the value of expert data, our framework provides practical, information-theoretic algorithms for agents to intelligently decide when to learn from others.

Abstract: Using LLMs to evaluate text, that is, LLM-as-a-judge, is increasingly being used at scale to augment or even replace human annotations. As such, it is imperative that we understand the potential biases and risks of doing so. In this work, we propose an approach for extracting high-level concept-based global policies from LLM-as-a-Judge. Our approach consists of two algorithms: 1) CLoVE (Contrastive Local Verifiable Explanations), which generates verifiable, concept-based, contrastive local explanations and 2) GloVE (Global Verifiable Explanations), which uses iterative clustering, summarization and verification to condense local rules into a global policy. We evaluate GloVE on seven standard benchmarking datasets for content harm detection. We find that the extracted global policies are highly faithful to decisions of the LLM-as-a-Judge. Additionally, we evaluated the robustness of global policies to text perturbations and adversarial attacks. Finally, we conducted a user study to evaluate user understanding and satisfaction with global policies.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong generalization capabilities, enabling them to recognize a wide range of objects across diverse domains without additional training. However, they often retain irrelevant information beyond the requirements of specific downstream tasks, raising concerns about computational efficiency and potential information leakage. This has motivated growing interest in approximate unlearning, which aims to selectively remove unnecessary knowledge while preserving overall model performance. Existing approaches to approximate unlearning have primarily focused on class unlearning, where a VLM is retrained to fail to recognize specified object classes while maintaining accuracy for others. However, merely forgetting object classes is often insufficient in practical applications. For instance, an autonomous driving system should accurately recognize real cars while avoiding misrecognition of illustrated cars depicted in roadside advertisements as real cars, which could be hazardous. In this paper, we introduce Approximate Domain Unlearning (ADU), a novel problem setting that requires reducing recognition accuracy for images from specified domains (e.g., illustration) while preserving accuracy for other domains (e.g., real). ADU presents new technical challenges: due to the strong domain generalization capability of pre-trained VLMs, domain distributions are highly entangled in the feature space, making naive approaches based on penalizing target domains ineffective. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel approach that explicitly disentangles domain distributions and adaptively captures instance-specific domain information. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms baselines built upon VLM tuning techniques, paving the way for practical and fine-grained unlearning in VLMs. Code: https://kodaikawamura.github.io/Domain_Unlearning/.

<title>Improving Temporal Understanding Logic Consistency in Video-Language Models via Attention Enhancement</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate self-contradictory outputs, which severely impacts their reliability and hinders their adoption in practical applications. In video-language models (Video-LLMs), this phenomenon recently draws the attention of researchers. Specifically, these models fail to provide logically consistent responses to rephrased questions based on their grounding outputs. However, the underlying causes of this phenomenon remain underexplored. In this work, we adopt an interpretability-driven approach to analyze, statistically summarize, and intervention the potential factors of the phenomenon. We find that one of the primary reasons for the inconsistency in responses lies in the inability of cross-modal attention heads to effectively distinguish video tokens across different timestamps. To address this, we propose an attention enhancement method called Temporally Conditioned Attention Sharpening (TCAS), which constructs an enhancement objective based on attention distinctions to enhance the model's temporal resolution capability, thereby improving its temporal understanding logic consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the temporal logic consistency of Video-LLMs. Further interpretability analyses reveal that our method indeed improves the temporal discriminability of attention heads, validating our conclusions. Additionally, our method achieves performance improvements in general video temporal grounding tasks, highlighting that temporal logic consistency is a bottleneck in temporal understanding. By enhancing consistency, our method drives significant progress in video temporal understanding.

<title>Think Just Enough: Sequence-Level Entropy as a Confidence Signal for LLM Reasoning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.08146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a simple, yet novel entropy-based framework to drive token efficiency in large language models during reasoning tasks. Our approach uses Shannon entropy from token-level logprobs as a confidence signal to enable early stopping, achieving 25-50% computational savings while maintaining task accuracy. Crucially, we demonstrate that entropy-based confidence calibration represents an emergent property of advanced post-training optimization present in modern reasoning models but notably absent in standard instruction-tuned and pre-trained models (Llama 3.3 70B). We show that the entropy threshold to stop reasoning varies from model to model but can be calculated easily in one shot using only a few examples from existing reasoning datasets. Our results indicate that advanced reasoning models often know that they've gotten a correct answer early on, and that this emergent confidence awareness can be exploited to save tokens and reduce latency. The framework demonstrates consistent performance across reasoning-optimized model families with 25-50% computational cost reduction while preserving accuracy, revealing that confidence mechanisms represent a distinguishing characteristic of modern post-trained reasoning systems versus their predecessors.

Abstract: The utilization of conversational AI systems by leveraging Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to solve customer problems has been on the rise with the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the absence of a company-specific dedicated knowledge base is a major barrier to the integration of conversational AI systems in contact centers. To this end, we introduce AI Knowledge Assist, a system that extracts knowledge in the form of question-answer (QA) pairs from historical customer-agent conversations to automatically build a knowledge base. Fine-tuning a lightweight LLM on internal data demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming larger closed-source LLMs. More specifically, empirical evaluation on 20 companies demonstrates that the proposed AI Knowledge Assist system that leverages the LLaMA-3.1-8B model eliminates the cold-start gap in contact centers by achieving above 90% accuracy in answering information-seeking questions. This enables immediate deployment of RAG-powered chatbots.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled their adoption in real-world industrial scenarios for various natural language processing tasks. However, the high inference cost of large-scale LLMs makes their deployment impractical, necessitating the use of smaller models. Despite their efficiency, smaller LLMs lack robust zero-shot instruction-following capabilities across diverse domains, limiting their adaptability to dynamic user requirements. Traditional fine-tuning approaches exacerbate this issue by inducing catastrophic forgetting, reducing the model's generalization ability for unseen tasks. In this paper, we propose Domain Adaptive Continual Instruction Pre-Training via Reading Comprehension (DACIP-RC), a continual pre-training technique that enhances smaller LLMs' domain adaptability for business conversational tasks. Unlike conventional pre-training approaches that rely on next-token prediction, DACIP-RC generates diverse task instructions and responses via reading comprehension on conversation transcripts, enabling better instruction generalization. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that DACIP-RC significantly improves zero-shot generalization across a wide range of business conversational tasks, including meeting summarization, action item generation, and call purpose identification. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply instruction pre-training on business conversational data, providing insights into how industries can leverage proprietary datasets for domain adaptation.

In particular, our agents learn: efficient logarithmic-depth quantum circuits for the Quantum Fourier Transform; Grover's search algorithm; optimal cheating strategies for strong coin flipping; and optimal winning strategies for the CHSH and other nonlocal games. The agents achieve these results directly through interaction, without prior access to known optimal solutions. This demonstrates the potential of quantum intelligence as a tool for algorithmic discovery, opening the way for the automated design of novel quantum algorithms and protocols.

Abstract: Instruction-following navigation is a key step toward embodied intelligence. Prior benchmarks mainly focus on semantic understanding but overlook systematically evaluating navigation agents' spatial perception and reasoning capabilities. In this work, we introduce the NavSpace benchmark, which contains six task categories and 1,228 trajectory-instruction pairs designed to probe the spatial intelligence of navigation agents. On this benchmark, we comprehensively evaluate 22 navigation agents, including state-of-the-art navigation models and multimodal large language models. The evaluation results lift the veil on spatial intelligence in embodied navigation. Furthermore, we propose SNav, a new spatially intelligent navigation model. SNav outperforms existing navigation agents on NavSpace and real robot tests, establishing a strong baseline for future work.

Abstract: Audio-based lyrics matching can be an appealing alternative to other content-based retrieval approaches, but existing methods often suffer from limited reproducibility and inconsistent baselines. In this work, we introduce WEALY, a fully reproducible pipeline that leverages Whisper decoder embeddings for lyrics matching tasks. WEALY establishes robust and transparent baselines, while also exploring multimodal extensions that integrate textual and acoustic features. Through extensive experiments on standard datasets, we demonstrate that WEALY achieves a performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods that lack reproducibility. In addition, we provide ablation studies and analyses on language robustness, loss functions, and embedding strategies. This work contributes a reliable benchmark for future research, and underscores the potential of speech technologies for music information retrieval tasks.

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) tasks, such as insect and bird identification, demand sensitivity to subtle visual cues while remaining robust to spatial transformations. A key challenge is handling geometric biases and noise, such as different orientations and scales of objects. Existing remedies rely on heavy data augmentation, which demands powerful models, or on equivariant architectures, which constrain expressivity and add cost. Canonicalization offers an alternative by shielding such biases from the downstream model. In practice, such functions are often obtained using canonicalization priors, which assume aligned training data. Unfortunately, real-world datasets never fulfill this assumption, causing the obtained canonicalizer to be brittle. We propose a bootstrapping algorithm that iteratively re-aligns training samples by progressively reducing variance and recovering the alignment assumption. We establish convergence guarantees under mild conditions for arbitrary compact groups, and show on four FGVC benchmarks that our method consistently outperforms equivariant, and canonicalization baselines while performing on par with augmentation.

Abstract: Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs) are likely to become an important part of the transportation system, making effective human-SAV interactions an important area of research. This paper introduces a dataset of 200 human-SAV interactions to further this area of study. We present an open-source human-SAV conversational dataset, comprising both textual data (e.g., 2,136 human-SAV exchanges) and empirical data (e.g., post-interaction survey results on a range of psychological factors). The dataset's utility is demonstrated through two benchmark case studies: First, using random forest modeling and chord diagrams, we identify key predictors of SAV acceptance and perceived service quality, highlighting the critical influence of response sentiment polarity (i.e., perceived positivity). Second, we benchmark the performance of an LLM-based sentiment analysis tool against the traditional lexicon-based TextBlob method. Results indicate that even simple zero-shot LLM prompts more closely align with user-reported sentiment, though limitations remain. This study provides novel insights for designing conversational SAV interfaces and establishes a foundation for further exploration into advanced sentiment modeling, adaptive user interactions, and multimodal conversational systems.

<title>Memory Retrieval and Consolidation in Large Language Models through Function Tokens</title>

Abstract: The remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) stems from their ability to consolidate vast amounts of knowledge into the memory during pre-training and to retrieve it from the memory during inference, enabling advanced capabilities such as knowledge memorization, instruction-following and reasoning. However, the mechanisms of memory retrieval and consolidation in LLMs remain poorly understood. In this paper, we propose the function token hypothesis to explain the workings of LLMs: During inference, function tokens activate the most predictive features from context and govern next token prediction (memory retrieval). During pre-training, predicting the next tokens (usually content tokens) that follow function tokens increases the number of learned features of LLMs and updates the model parameters (memory consolidation). Function tokens here roughly correspond to function words in linguistics, including punctuation marks, articles, prepositions, and conjunctions, in contrast to content tokens. We provide extensive experimental evidence supporting this hypothesis. Using bipartite graph analysis, we show that a small number of function tokens activate the majority of features. Case studies further reveal how function tokens activate the most predictive features from context to direct next token prediction. We also find that during pre-training, the training loss is dominated by predicting the next content tokens following function tokens, which forces the function tokens to select the most predictive features from context.

Abstract: Previous research has shown that LLMs finetuned on malicious or incorrect completions within narrow domains (e.g., insecure code or incorrect medical advice) can become broadly misaligned to exhibit harmful behaviors, which is called emergent misalignment. In this work, we investigate whether this phenomenon can extend beyond safety behaviors to a broader spectrum of dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios (e.g., lying under pressure and deceptive behavior). To explore this, we finetune open-sourced LLMs on misaligned completions across diverse domains. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs show broadly misaligned behavior in dishonesty. Additionally, we further explore this phenomenon in a downstream combined finetuning setting, and find that introducing as little as 1% of misalignment data into a standard downstream task is sufficient to decrease honest behavior over 20%. Furthermore, we consider a more practical human-AI interaction environment where we simulate both benign and biased users to interact with the assistant LLM. Notably, we find that the assistant can be misaligned unintentionally to exacerbate its dishonesty with only 10% biased user population. In summary, we extend the study of emergent misalignment to the domain of dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios, and demonstrate that this risk arises not only through direct finetuning, but also in downstream mixture tasks and practical human-AI interactions.

Abstract: In the shipping industry, fuel consumption and emissions are critical factors due to their significant impact on economic efficiency and environmental sustainability. Accurate prediction of ship fuel consumption is essential for further optimization of maritime operations. However, heterogeneous methodologies and limited high-quality datasets hinder direct comparison of modeling approaches. This paper makes three key contributions: (1) we introduce and release a new dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/krohnedigital/FuelCast) comprising operational and environmental data from three ships; (2) we define a standardized benchmark covering tabular regression and time-series regression (3) we investigate the application of in-context learning for ship consumption modeling using the TabPFN foundation model - a first in this domain to our knowledge. Our results demonstrate strong performance across all evaluated models, supporting the feasibility of onboard, data-driven fuel prediction. Models incorporating environmental conditions consistently outperform simple polynomial baselines relying solely on vessel speed. TabPFN slightly outperforms other techniques, highlighting the potential of foundation models with in-context learning capabilities for tabular prediction. Furthermore, including temporal context improves accuracy.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful paradigm for learning to make sequences of decisions. However, RL has yet to be fully leveraged in robotics, principally due to its lack of scalability. Offline RL offers a promising avenue by training agents on large, diverse datasets, avoiding the costly real-world interactions of online RL. Scaling offline RL to increasingly complex datasets requires expressive generative models such as diffusion and flow matching. However, existing methods typically depend on either backpropagation through time (BPTT), which is computationally prohibitive, or policy distillation, which introduces compounding errors and limits scalability to larger base policies. In this paper, we consider the question of how to develop a scalable offline RL approach without relying on distillation or backpropagation through time. We introduce Expressive Value Learning for Offline Reinforcement Learning (EVOR): a scalable offline RL approach that integrates both expressive policies and expressive value functions. EVOR learns an optimal, regularized Q-function via flow matching during training. At inference-time, EVOR performs inference-time policy extraction via rejection sampling against the expressive value function, enabling efficient optimization, regularization, and compute-scalable search without retraining. Empirically, we show that EVOR outperforms baselines on a diverse set of offline RL tasks, demonstrating the benefit of integrating expressive value learning into offline RL.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increas- ingly integral to information dissemination and decision-making processes. Given their grow- ing societal influence, understanding potential biases, particularly within the political domain, is crucial to prevent undue influence on public opinion and democratic processes. This work investigates political bias and stereotype propa- gation across eight prominent LLMs using the two-dimensional Political Compass Test (PCT). Initially, the PCT is employed to assess the in- herent political leanings of these models. Sub- sequently, persona prompting with the PCT is used to explore explicit stereotypes across vari- ous social dimensions. In a final step, implicit stereotypes are uncovered by evaluating mod- els with multilingual versions of the PCT. Key findings reveal a consistent left-leaning polit- ical alignment across all investigated models. Furthermore, while the nature and extent of stereotypes vary considerably between models, implicit stereotypes elicited through language variation are more pronounced than those iden- tified via explicit persona prompting. Interest- ingly, for most models, implicit and explicit stereotypes show a notable alignment, suggest- ing a degree of transparency or "awareness" regarding their inherent biases. This study un- derscores the complex interplay of political bias and stereotypes in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on huge amounts of textual data, and concerns have been raised that the limits of such data may soon be reached. A potential solution is to train on synthetic data sampled from LLMs. In this work, we build on this idea and investigate the benefits of contrastive decoding for generating synthetic corpora. In a controlled setting, we experiment with sampling corpora using the relative difference between a good and bad model trained on the same original corpus of 100 million words. By amplifying the signal from a model that has better performance, we create a synthetic corpus and mix it with the original training data. Our findings show that training on a mixture of synthesized and real data improves performance on the language modeling objective and a range of downstream tasks. In particular, we see that training with a mix of synthetic data from contrastive decoding benefits tasks that require more reasoning skills, while synthetic data from traditional sampling helps more on tasks dependent on surface level linguistic capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as autonomous agents in real-world environments. As these deployments scale, multi-agent interactions become inevitable, making it essential to understand strategic behavior in such systems. A central open question is whether LLM agents, like reinforcement learning agents, can shape the learning dynamics and influence the behavior of others through interaction alone. In this paper, we present the first investigation of opponent shaping (OS) with LLM-based agents. Existing OS algorithms cannot be directly applied to LLMs, as they require higher-order derivatives, face scalability constraints, or depend on architectural components that are absent in transformers. To address this gap, we introduce ShapeLLM, an adaptation of model-free OS methods tailored for transformer-based agents. Using ShapeLLM, we examine whether LLM agents can influence co-players' learning dynamics across diverse game-theoretic environments. We demonstrate that LLM agents can successfully guide opponents toward exploitable equilibria in competitive games (Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, Matching Pennies, and Chicken) and promote coordination and improve collective welfare in cooperative games (Iterated Stag Hunt and a cooperative version of the Prisoner's Dilemma). Our findings show that LLM agents can both shape and be shaped through interaction, establishing opponent shaping as a key dimension of multi-agent LLM research.

<title>Mix- and MoE-DPO: A Variational Inference Approach to Direct Preference Optimization</title>

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently emerged as a simple and effective alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models (LLMs) with user preferences. However, existing DPO formulations rely on a single monolithic model, which limits their expressivity in multi-task settings and their adaptability to heterogeneous or diverse preference distributions. In this work, we propose Mix- and MoE-DPO, a framework that extends DPO with both soft mixture models and mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures, using a stochastic variational inference approach. Our method introduces a latent-variable model over expert assignments and optimizes a variational evidence lower bound (ELBO), enabling stable and efficient learning of specialized expert policies from preference data. Mix- and MoE-DPO provides three key advantages over standard DPO: (i) generalization via universal function approximation through mixtures; (ii) reward and policy specialization through expert components tailored to distinct preference modes; and (iii) contextual alignment through input-dependent soft gating that enables user-specific mixture policies. Our framework supports both shared base architectures with expert-specific policy heads and fully independent expert models, allowing flexible trade-offs between parameter efficiency and specialization. We validate our approach on a variety of model sizes and multi-preference datasets, demonstrating that Mix- and MoE-DPO offers a powerful and scalable method for preference-based LLM alignment.

Abstract: In-memory computing technology is used extensively in artificial intelligence devices due to lower power consumption and fast calculation of matrix-based functions. The development of such a device and its integration in a system takes a significant amount of time and requires the use of a real-time emulation environment, where various system aspects are analyzed, microcode is tested, and applications are deployed, even before the real chip is available. In this work, we present the architecture, the software development tools, and experimental results of a distributed and expandable emulation system for rapid prototyping of integrated circuits based on in-memory computing technologies. Presented experimental results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed emulator.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural scene representations have led to unprecedented quality in 3D reconstruction and view synthesis. Despite achieving high-quality results for common benchmarks with curated data, outputs often degrade for data that contain per image variations such as strong exposure changes, present, e.g., in most scenes with indoor and outdoor areas or rooms with windows. In this paper, we introduce Neural Exposure Fields (NExF), a novel technique for robustly reconstructing 3D scenes with high quality and 3D-consistent appearance from challenging real-world captures. In the core, we propose to learn a neural field predicting an optimal exposure value per 3D point, enabling us to optimize exposure along with the neural scene representation. While capture devices such as cameras select optimal exposure per image/pixel, we generalize this concept and perform optimization in 3D instead. This enables accurate view synthesis in high dynamic range scenarios, bypassing the need of post-processing steps or multi-exposure captures. Our contributions include a novel neural representation for exposure prediction, a system for joint optimization of the scene representation and the exposure field via a novel neural conditioning mechanism, and demonstrated superior performance on challenging real-world data. We find that our approach trains faster than prior works and produces state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks improving by over 55% over best-performing baselines.

Abstract: We address the open question of counterfactual identification for high-dimensional multivariate outcomes from observational data. Pearl (2000) argues that counterfactuals must be identifiable (i.e., recoverable from the observed data distribution) to justify causal claims. A recent line of work on counterfactual inference shows promising results but lacks identification, undermining the causal validity of its estimates. To address this, we establish a foundation for multivariate counterfactual identification using continuous-time flows, including non-Markovian settings under standard criteria. We characterise the conditions under which flow matching yields a unique, monotone and rank-preserving counterfactual transport map with tools from dynamic optimal transport, ensuring consistent inference. Building on this, we validate the theory in controlled scenarios with counterfactual ground-truth and demonstrate improvements in axiomatic counterfactual soundness on real images.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR), the automated discovery of mathematical expressions from data, is a cornerstone of scientific inquiry. However, it is often hindered by the combinatorial explosion of the search space and a tendency to overfit. Popular methods, rooted in genetic programming, explore this space syntactically, often yielding overly complex, uninterpretable models. This paper introduces IdeaSearchFitter, a framework that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) as semantic operators within an evolutionary search. By generating candidate expressions guided by natural-language rationales, our method biases discovery towards models that are not only accurate but also conceptually coherent and interpretable. We demonstrate IdeaSearchFitter's efficacy across diverse challenges: it achieves competitive, noise-robust performance on the Feynman Symbolic Regression Database (FSReD), outperforming several strong baselines; discovers mechanistically aligned models with good accuracy-complexity trade-offs on real-world data; and derives compact, physically-motivated parametrizations for Parton Distribution Functions in a frontier high-energy physics application. IdeaSearchFitter is a specialized module within our broader iterated agent framework, IdeaSearch, which is publicly available at https://www.ideasearch.cn/.

Abstract: We study length generalization in transformers through the set complement task, where a model must predict a uniform distribution over tokens absent from an input sequence -- an ability central to board-game style reasoning. Our main theoretical result establishes two statements. First, we prove tight bounds on embedding and value dimensions for single-layer attention-only transformers. Second, we show that if such a model achieves balanced logit displacement at lengths 1 and 2, then it must generalize to longer sequences, though with reduced precision. A mechanistic reading of the proof explains this limitation: as more tokens are attended to, softmax compresses logit displacements, eroding separation between valid and invalid outputs. Training dynamics also suggest a second obstacle: when many next tokens are possible, updates become noisy. We hypothesize that dropout can counteract the first effect and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) the second. We validate these hypotheses through random hyperparameter search on the set complement task, which confirms both mechanisms. We then test OthelloGPT, a GPT-1 style model trained on random Othello moves, and find that EMA again improves length generalization in this more complex setting.

Abstract: We introduce DeepEN, a deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework for personalized enteral nutrition (EN) in critically ill patients. Trained offline on over 11,000 ICU patients from the MIMIC-IV database, DeepEN generates 4-hourly recommendations for caloric, protein, and fluid intake tailored to each patient's evolving physiology. The model integrates a curated, clinically informed state space with a custom reward function that balances short-term physiological and nutrition-related goals with long-term survival outcomes. Using a dueling double deep Q-network with conservative Q-learning regularization, DeepEN learns clinically realistic policies that align with high-value clinician actions while discouraging unsafe deviations. Across various qualitative and quantitative metrics, DeepEN outperforms clinician-derived and guideline-based policies, achieving a 3.7 $\pm$ 0.17 percentage-point reduction in estimated mortality (18.8% vs 22.5%) and improvements in key nutritional biomarkers. These findings highlight the potential of safe, data-driven personalization of EN therapy to improve outcomes beyond traditional guideline- or heuristic-based approaches.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly powerful, demonstrating strong performance on a variety of tasks that require both visual and textual understanding. Their strong generalisation abilities make them a promising component for automated driving systems, which must handle unexpected corner cases. However, to be trusted in such safety-critical applications, a model must first possess a reliable perception system. Moreover, since critical objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at a distance, we require systems that are not "shortsighted", i.e., systems with strong perception capabilities at both close (up to 20 meters) and long (30+ meters) range. With this in mind, we introduce Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question Answering (DTPQA), the first Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark focused solely on perception-based questions in traffic scenes, enriched with distance annotations. By excluding questions that require reasoning, we ensure that model performance reflects perception capabilities alone. Since automated driving hardware has limited processing power and cannot support large VLMs, our study centers on smaller VLMs. More specifically, we evaluate several state-of-the-art (SOTA) small VLMs on DTPQA and show that, despite the simplicity of the questions, these models significantly underperform compared to humans (~60% average accuracy for the best-performing small VLM versus ~85% human performance). However, it is important to note that the human sample size was relatively small, which imposes statistical limitations. We also identify specific perception tasks, such as distinguishing left from right, that remain particularly challenging for these models.

Abstract: As industrial robots move into shared human spaces, their opaque decision making threatens safety, trust, and public oversight. This artwork, Airy, asks whether complex multi agent AI can become intuitively understandable by staging a competition between two reinforcement trained robot arms that snap a bedsheet skyward. Building on three design principles, competition as a clear metric (who lifts higher), embodied familiarity (audiences recognize fabric snapping), and sensor to sense mapping (robot cooperation or rivalry shown through forest and weather projections), the installation gives viewers a visceral way to read machine intent. Observations from five international exhibitions indicate that audiences consistently read the robots' strategies, conflict, and cooperation in real time, with emotional reactions that mirror the system's internal state. The project shows how sensory metaphors can turn a black box into a public interface.

Abstract: Historical map legends are critical for interpreting cartographic symbols. However, their inconsistent layouts and unstructured formats make automatic extraction challenging. Prior work focuses primarily on segmentation or general optical character recognition (OCR), with few methods effectively matching legend symbols to their corresponding descriptions in a structured manner. We present a method that combines LayoutLMv3 for layout detection with GPT-4o using in-context learning to detect and link legend items and their descriptions via bounding box predictions. Our experiments show that GPT-4 with structured JSON prompts outperforms the baseline, achieving 88% F-1 and 85% IoU, and reveal how prompt design, example counts, and layout alignment affect performance. This approach supports scalable, layout-aware legend parsing and improves the indexing and searchability of historical maps across various visual styles.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for foundation models, but it suffers from parameter interference, resulting in suboptimal performance. Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based LoRA variants show promise in mitigating intra-task correlations in single-task instruction tuning, they introduce additional router parameters and remain ineffective in multi-task model merging where inter-task interference arises. Inspired by the fly olfactory circuit, we propose FlyLoRA, an implicit MoE-based LoRA variant that introduces: (1) rank-wise expert activation in the up-projection matrix, and (2) an implicit router that unifies expert routing and down-projection, where a frozen sparse random projection matrix replaces the traditional dense trainable version. This design resolves the trade-off between intra-task decorrelation and computational efficiency by eliminating the need for an explicit router, while inherently mitigating inter-task interference due to the orthogonality property of random matrices. Extensive experiments across four domains -- general knowledge understanding, scientific question answering, mathematical reasoning, and code generation -- demonstrate consistent performance improvements over existing methods. Beyond empirical gains, FlyLoRA highlights how biological structures can inspire innovations in AI technologies. Code is available at https://github.com/gfyddha/FlyLoRA.

Abstract: We show that a tiny Co$^4$ machine(Adeel,2025) with a single layer, two heads, and 8M parameters, operating at an approximate cost of $O(N)$ (where $N$ is the number of input tokens), outpaces the BabyLM Challenge baselines GPT-2 (124M, 12 layers, $O(N^2))$ and GPT-BERT (30M, 12 layers, $O(N^2))$ in just two epochs, while both are trained for ten. Co$^4$ achieves orders-of-magnitude greater training efficiency on 10M tokens, demonstrating highly sample efficient pretraining. Using the BabyLM challenge evaluation pipeline across complex benchmarks, Co$^4$ exhibits strong zero-shot and fine-tuning performance on SuperGLUE tasks. Specifically, Co$^4$ outperforms GPT-2 on 5 out of 7 zero-shot metrics and 6 out of 7 fine-tuning tasks, and GPT-BERT on 4 out of 7 metrics in both cases. These results suggest the need to rethink prevailing deep learning paradigms and associated scaling laws.

Abstract: Many prompt engineering techniques have been successful in practice, even when optimizing over a large prompt space with with a small amount of task-specific data. Recent work has partially explained this success by showing generalization bounds which apply PAC-Bayes theory to the discrete prompt space, but they are non-vacuous only in data-rich scenarios. We argue that such widespread success can be more fully explained through more carefully considering data- or distribution-dependent perplexity, which acts as an effective prior and steers the optimization towards prompts that are more ``natural'' for the task at hand. We derive novel generalization bounds that are non-vacuous for data-scarce prompt optimization via more useful priors, formally analyzing how perplexity regularization tightens these bounds by limiting exploration. Empirically, we explore both the bounds' effectiveness and the practical benefits of perplexity regularization in improving prompt generalization.

Abstract: Reinsurance treaty pricing must satisfy stringent regulatory standards, yet current quoting practices remain opaque and difficult to audit. We introduce ClauseLens, a clause-grounded reinforcement learning framework that produces transparent, regulation-compliant, and risk-aware treaty quotes.
  ClauseLens models the quoting task as a Risk-Aware Constrained Markov Decision Process (RA-CMDP). Statutory and policy clauses are retrieved from legal and underwriting corpora, embedded into the agent's observations, and used both to constrain feasible actions and to generate clause-grounded natural language justifications.
  Evaluated in a multi-agent treaty simulator calibrated to industry data, ClauseLens reduces solvency violations by 51%, improves tail-risk performance by 27.9% (CVaR_0.10), and achieves 88.2% accuracy in clause-grounded explanations with retrieval precision of 87.4% and recall of 91.1%.
  These findings demonstrate that embedding legal context into both decision and explanation pathways yields interpretable, auditable, and regulation-aligned quoting behavior consistent with Solvency II, NAIC RBC, and the EU AI Act.

Abstract: Modern LLM deployments confront a widening cost-performance spectrum: premium models deliver strong reasoning but are expensive, while lightweight models are economical yet brittle on complex tasks. Static escalation rules and keyword heuristics under-utilize this spectrum and fail to adapt across task types. We present xRouter, a tool-calling-based routing system in which a learned router can either answer directly or invoke one or more external models. The router is trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning using an explicit, cost-aware reward that encodes cost-performance trade-offs, eliminating the need for hand-engineered routing rules. Our implementation encompasses the full reinforcement learning framework, including reward and cost accounting, as well as the deployment and evaluation pipelines. Across diverse benchmarks, xRouter achieves strong cost-performance trade-offs (e.g., substantial cost reductions at comparable task completion rates), and provides empirical insights into what reliably helps learned routing and what does not, ranging from model trainability to the difficulty of eliciting sophisticated orchestration behaviors in small open models. We hope these findings and our open implementation will serve as a practical substrate for advancing learned, cost-aware LLM orchestration.

Abstract: Visual Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents must learn to act based on high-dimensional image data where only a small fraction of the pixels is task-relevant. This forces agents to waste exploration and computational resources on irrelevant features, leading to sample-inefficient and unstable learning. To address this, inspired by human visual foveation, we introduce Gaze on the Prize. This framework augments visual RL with a learnable foveal attention mechanism (Gaze), guided by a self-supervised signal derived from the agent's experience pursuing higher returns (the Prize). Our key insight is that return differences reveal what matters most: If two similar representations produce different outcomes, their distinguishing features are likely task-relevant, and the gaze should focus on them accordingly. This is realized through return-guided contrastive learning that trains the attention to distinguish between the features relevant to success and failure. We group similar visual representations into positives and negatives based on their return differences and use the resulting labels to construct contrastive triplets. These triplets provide the training signal that teaches the attention mechanism to produce distinguishable representations for states associated with different outcomes. Our method achieves up to 2.4x improvement in sample efficiency and can solve tasks that the baseline fails to learn, demonstrated across a suite of manipulation tasks from the ManiSkill3 benchmark, all without modifying the underlying algorithm or hyperparameters.

Inspired by complex dynamic system theories, we design a series-symbol data generation mechanism, enabling the unrestricted creation of high-quality time series data paired with corresponding symbolic expressions. To leverage series-symbol data pairs with strong correlations, we develop \texttt{SymTime}, a pre-trained foundation model for enhancing time series representation using symbolic information. \texttt{SymTime} demonstrates competitive performance across five major TSA tasks when fine-tunes with downstream tasks, rivaling foundation models pre-trained on real-world datasets. This approach underscores the potential of series-symbol data generation and pretraining mechanisms in overcoming data scarcity and enhancing task performance. The code is available at https://github.com/wwhenxuan/SymTime.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) leverage the graph structure to transmit information between nodes, typically through the message-passing mechanism. While these models have found a wide variety of applications, they are known to suffer from over-squashing, where information from a large receptive field of node representations is collapsed into a single fixed sized vector, resulting in an information bottleneck. In this paper, we re-examine the over-squashing phenomenon through the lens of model storage and retrieval capacity, which we define as the amount of information that can be stored in a node's representation for later use. We study some of the limitations of existing tasks used to measure over-squashing and introduce a new synthetic task to demonstrate that an information bottleneck can saturate this capacity. Furthermore, we adapt ideas from the sequence modeling literature on associative memories, fast weight programmers, and the xLSTM model to develop a novel GNN architecture with improved capacity. We demonstrate strong performance of this architecture both on our capacity synthetic task, as well as a range of real-world graph benchmarks.

<title>Integral Signatures of Activation Functions: A 9-Dimensional Taxonomy and Stability Theory for Deep Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08456</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.08456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Activation functions govern the expressivity and stability of neural networks, yet existing comparisons remain largely heuristic. We propose a rigorous framework for their classification via a nine-dimensional integral signature S_sigma(phi), combining Gaussian propagation statistics (m1, g1, g2, m2, eta), asymptotic slopes (alpha_plus, alpha_minus), and regularity measures (TV(phi'), C(phi)). This taxonomy establishes well-posedness, affine reparameterization laws with bias, and closure under bounded slope variation. Dynamical analysis yields Lyapunov theorems with explicit descent constants and identifies variance stability regions through (m2', g2). From a kernel perspective, we derive dimension-free Hessian bounds and connect smoothness to bounded variation of phi'. Applying the framework, we classify eight standard activations (ReLU, leaky-ReLU, tanh, sigmoid, Swish, GELU, Mish, TeLU), proving sharp distinctions between saturating, linear-growth, and smooth families. Numerical Gauss-Hermite and Monte Carlo validation confirms theoretical predictions. Our framework provides principled design guidance, moving activation choice from trial-and-error to provable stability and kernel conditioning.

Abstract: We present a platform-agnostic modular architecture that addresses the increasingly fragmented landscape of quantum computing benchmarking by decoupling problem generation, circuit execution, and results analysis into independent, interoperable components. Supporting over 20 benchmark variants ranging from simple algorithmic tests like Bernstein-Vazirani to complex Hamiltonian simulation with observable calculations, the system integrates with multiple circuit generation APIs (Qiskit, CUDA-Q, Cirq) and enables diverse workflows. We validate the architecture through successful integration with Sandia's $\textit{pyGSTi}$ for advanced circuit analysis and CUDA-Q for multi-GPU HPC simulations. Extensibility of the system is demonstrated by implementing dynamic circuit variants of existing benchmarks and a new quantum reinforcement learning benchmark, which become readily available across multiple execution and analysis modes. Our primary contribution is identifying and formalizing modular interfaces that enable interoperability between incompatible benchmarking frameworks, demonstrating that standardized interfaces reduce ecosystem fragmentation while preserving optimization flexibility. This architecture has been developed as a key enhancement to the continually evolving QED-C Application-Oriented Performance Benchmarks for Quantum Computing suite.

Abstract: Parallel scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm to enhance reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) by generating multiple Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces simultaneously. However, this approach introduces significant computational inefficiency due to inter-trace redundancy -- our analysis reveals that over 80% of parallel reasoning traces yield identical final answers, representing substantial wasted computation. To address this critical efficiency bottleneck, we propose DeepPrune, a novel framework that enables efficient parallel scaling through dynamic pruning. Our method features a specialized judge model trained with focal loss and oversampling techniques to accurately predict answer equivalence from partial reasoning traces which realizes 0.87 AUROC on equivalence prediction, combined with an online greedy clustering algorithm that dynamically prunes redundant paths while preserving answer diversity. Comprehensive evaluations across three challenging benchmarks (AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and GPQA) and multiple reasoning models demonstrate that DeepPrune achieves remarkable token reduction by over 80% compared to conventional consensus sampling on most cases, while maintaining competitive accuracy within 3 percentage points. Our work establishes a new standard for efficient parallel reasoning, making high-performance reasoning more efficient. Our code and data are here: https://deepprune.github.io/

Abstract: Traumatic brain injuries present significant diagnostic challenges in emergency medicine, where the timely interpretation of medical images is crucial for patient outcomes. In this paper, we propose a novel AI-based approach for automatic radiology report generation tailored to cranial trauma cases. Our model integrates an AC-BiFPN with a Transformer architecture to capture and process complex medical imaging data such as CT and MRI scans. The AC-BiFPN extracts multi-scale features, enabling the detection of intricate anomalies like intracranial hemorrhages, while the Transformer generates coherent, contextually relevant diagnostic reports by modeling long-range dependencies. We evaluate the performance of our model on the RSNA Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection dataset, where it outperforms traditional CNN-based models in both diagnostic accuracy and report generation. This solution not only supports radiologists in high-pressure environments but also provides a powerful educational tool for trainee physicians, offering real-time feedback and enhancing their learning experience. Our findings demonstrate the potential of combining advanced feature extraction with transformer-based text generation to improve clinical decision-making in the diagnosis of traumatic brain injuries.

<title>To Sink or Not to Sink: Visual Information Pathways in Large Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have recently emerged as powerful architectures capable of understanding and reasoning over both visual and textual information. These models typically rely on two key components: a Vision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM). ViT encodes visual content into a sequence of image tokens and serves as the perceptual front-end -- the eyes of the model. In contrast, the LLM interprets these tokens to perform high-level reasoning, generates responses, and functions as the cognitive core -- the brain of the model. However, it remains unclear which visual tokens contribute most significantly to understanding and reasoning, and how effectively these signals are propagated from ViT to the LLM. While most existing works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens receiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus to the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from ViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely studied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these ViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the LLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning. Despite their importance, these sink tokens are often overlooked in existing LVLM architectures. To explore their contribution, we present both qualitative and quantitative analyses of the information embedded in these sink tokens. We also propose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage how this information is interpreted by the LLM, and to what extent. By explicitly utilizing these tokens, we demonstrate substantial improvements across a range of LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, highlighting the untapped potential of ViT attention sinks in enhancing visual reasoning.

Abstract: Self-evolution is a central research topic in enabling large language model (LLM)-based agents to continually improve their capabilities after pretraining. Recent research has witnessed a transition from reinforcement learning (RL)-free to RL-based methods. Current RL-based methods either rely on dense external reward signals or extract intrinsic reward signals from LLMs themselves. However, these approaches diverge from the self-evolution mechanisms observed in human intelligence, where individuals learn and improve through mutual discussion and collaboration. In this work, we introduce Co-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems (CoMAS), a novel framework that enables agents to improve autonomously by learning from inter-agent interactions without external supervision. CoMAS generates intrinsic rewards from rich discussion dynamics, employs an LLM-as-a-judge mechanism to formulate these rewards, and optimizes each agent's policy through RL, thereby enabling decentralized and scalable co-evolution. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMAS consistently outperforms untrained agents and achieves state-of-the-art performance across most evaluation settings. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of interaction-based reward signals and reveal promising scalability as the number and diversity of agents increase. These findings establish CoMAS as a novel and effective paradigm for self-evolution in LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning remains a fundamental challenge for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), with current approaches struggling to achieve robust performance despite recent advances. We identify that this limitation stems from a critical gap: existing methods attempt to learn spatial reasoning directly without establishing the hierarchical foundations of perception and understanding. To address this challenge, we present a comprehensive methodology for building spatial intelligence progressively. We introduce SpatialLadder-26k, a multimodal dataset containing 26,610 samples spanning object localization, single image, multi-view, and video spatial reasoning tasks, constructed through a standardized pipeline that ensures systematic coverage across modalities. Building on this dataset, we design a three-stage progressive training framework that (1) establishes spatial perception through object localization, (2) develops spatial understanding through multi-dimensional spatial tasks, and (3) strengthens complex reasoning via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. This approach yields SpatialLadder, a 3B-parameter model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning benchmarks, with 23.4% average improvement over the base model, surpassing GPT-4o by 20.8% and Gemini-2.0-Flash by 10.1%. Notably, SpatialLadder maintains strong generalization with 7.2% improvement on out-of-domain benchmarks, demonstrating that progressive training from perception to reasoning is essential for robust spatial intelligence.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing offers a powerful and intuitive way to manipulate images through natural language. Yet, relying solely on text instructions limits fine-grained control over the extent of edits. We introduce Kontinuous Kontext, an instruction-driven editing model that provides a new dimension of control over edit strength, enabling users to adjust edits gradually from no change to a fully realized result in a smooth and continuous manner. Kontinuous Kontext extends a state-of-the-art image editing model to accept an additional input, a scalar edit strength which is then paired with the edit instruction, enabling explicit control over the extent of the edit. To inject this scalar information, we train a lightweight projector network that maps the input scalar and the edit instruction to coefficients in the model's modulation space. For training our model, we synthesize a diverse dataset of image-edit-instruction-strength quadruplets using existing generative models, followed by a filtering stage to ensure quality and consistency. Kontinuous Kontext provides a unified approach for fine-grained control over edit strength for instruction driven editing from subtle to strong across diverse operations such as stylization, attribute, material, background, and shape changes, without requiring attribute-specific training.

<title>On the optimization dynamics of RLVR: Gradient gap and step size thresholds</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which uses simple binary feedback to post-train large language models, has shown significant empirical success. However, a principled understanding of why it works has been lacking. This paper builds a theoretical foundation for RLVR by analyzing its training process at both the full-response (trajectory) and token levels. Central to our analysis is a quantity called the Gradient Gap, which formalizes the direction of improvement from low-reward to high-reward regions of the response space. We prove that convergence critically depends on aligning the update direction with this Gradient Gap. Moreover, we derive a sharp step-size threshold based on the magnitude of the Gradient Gap: below it, learning converges, whereas above it, performance collapses. Our theory further predicts how the critical step size must scale with response length and the success rate, thereby explaining why practical heuristics such as length normalization improve stability and showing that, with a fixed learning rate, the success rate can stagnate strictly below $100\%$. We validate these predictions through controlled bandit simulations and LLM experiments, including training Qwen2.5-7B with GRPO.

Abstract: As Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) are deployed globally, they require understanding of and grounding in the relevant cultural background. To properly assess these models' cultural awareness, adequate benchmarks are needed. We introduce VideoNorms, a benchmark of over 1000 (video clip, norm) pairs from US and Chinese cultures annotated with socio-cultural norms grounded in speech act theory, norm adherence and violations labels, and verbal and non-verbal evidence. To build VideoNorms, we use a human-AI collaboration framework, where a teacher model using theoretically-grounded prompting provides candidate annotations and a set of trained human experts validate and correct the annotations. We benchmark a variety of open-weight VideoLLMs on the new dataset which highlight several common trends: 1) models performs worse on norm violation than adherence; 2) models perform worse w.r.t Chinese culture compared to the US culture; 3) models have more difficulty in providing non-verbal evidence compared to verbal for the norm adhere/violation label and struggle to identify the exact norm corresponding to a speech-act; and 4) unlike humans, models perform worse in formal, non-humorous contexts. Our findings emphasize the need for culturally-grounded video language model training - a gap our benchmark and framework begin to address.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to follow natural language instructions through environments, with memory-persistent variants demanding progressive improvement through accumulated experience. Existing approaches for memory-persistent VLN face critical limitations: they lack effective memory access mechanisms, instead relying on entire memory incorporation or fixed-horizon lookup, and predominantly store only environmental observations while neglecting navigation behavioral patterns that encode valuable decision-making strategies. We present Memoir, which employs imagination as a retrieval mechanism grounded by explicit memory: a world model imagines future navigation states as queries to selectively retrieve relevant environmental observations and behavioral histories. The approach comprises: 1) a language-conditioned world model that imagines future states serving dual purposes: encoding experiences for storage and generating retrieval queries; 2) Hybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory that anchors both observations and behavioral patterns to viewpoints, enabling hybrid retrieval; and 3) an experience-augmented navigation model that integrates retrieved knowledge through specialized encoders. Extensive evaluation across diverse memory-persistent VLN benchmarks with 10 distinctive testing scenarios demonstrates Memoir's effectiveness: significant improvements across all scenarios, with 5.4% SPL gains on IR2R over the best memory-persistent baseline, accompanied by 8.3x training speedup and 74% inference memory reduction. The results validate that predictive retrieval of both environmental and behavioral memories enables more effective navigation, with analysis indicating substantial headroom (73.3% vs 93.4% upper bound) for this imagination-guided paradigm.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress across various capabilities; however, complex video reasoning in the scientific domain remains a significant and challenging frontier. Current video benchmarks predominantly target general scenarios where perception/recognition is heavily relied on, while with relatively simple reasoning tasks, leading to saturation and thus failing to effectively evaluate advanced multimodal cognitive skills. To address this critical gap, we introduce SciVideoBench, a rigorous benchmark specifically designed to assess advanced video reasoning in scientific contexts. SciVideoBench consists of 1,000 carefully crafted multiple-choice questions derived from cutting-edge scientific experimental videos spanning over 25 specialized academic subjects and verified by a semi-automatic system. Each question demands sophisticated domain-specific knowledge, precise spatiotemporal perception, and intricate logical reasoning, effectively challenging models' higher-order cognitive abilities. Our evaluation highlights significant performance deficits in state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LMMs, including Gemini 2.5 Pro and Qwen2.5-VL, indicating substantial room for advancement in video reasoning capabilities. Detailed analyses of critical factors such as reasoning complexity and visual grounding provide valuable insights and clear direction for future developments in LMMs, driving the evolution of truly capable multimodal AI co-scientists. We hope SciVideoBench could fit the interests of the community and help to push the boundary of cutting-edge AI for border science.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as controllers with access to external tools for complex reasoning and decision-making, yet their effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal trajectories and the cost of manual annotation. We address this challenge with a vision-centric agent tuning framework that automatically synthesizes multimodal trajectories, generates step-wise preference pairs, and trains a VLM controller for robust tool-use reasoning. Our pipeline first constructs M-TRACE, a large-scale dataset of 28.5K multimodal tasks with 177K verified trajectories, enabling imitation-based trajectory tuning. Building on this, we develop MATRIX Agent, a controller finetuned on M-TRACE for step-wise tool reasoning. To achieve finer alignment, we further introduce Pref-X, a set of 11K automatically generated preference pairs, and optimize MATRIX on it via step-wise preference learning. Across three benchmarks, Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA, MATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs, demonstrating scalable and effective multimodal tool use.

Abstract: Enabling robots to execute novel manipulation tasks zero-shot is a central goal in robotics. Most existing methods assume in-distribution tasks or rely on fine-tuning with embodiment-matched data, limiting transfer across platforms. We present NovaFlow, an autonomous manipulation framework that converts a task description into an actionable plan for a target robot without any demonstrations. Given a task description, NovaFlow synthesizes a video using a video generation model and distills it into 3D actionable object flow using off-the-shelf perception modules. From the object flow, it computes relative poses for rigid objects and realizes them as robot actions via grasp proposals and trajectory optimization. For deformable objects, this flow serves as a tracking objective for model-based planning with a particle-based dynamics model. By decoupling task understanding from low-level control, NovaFlow naturally transfers across embodiments. We validate on rigid, articulated, and deformable object manipulation tasks using a table-top Franka arm and a Spot quadrupedal mobile robot, and achieve effective zero-shot execution without demonstrations or embodiment-specific training.

Abstract: Benchmarks are central to measuring the capabilities of large language models and guiding model development, yet widespread data leakage from pretraining corpora undermines their validity. Models can match memorized content rather than demonstrate true generalization, which inflates scores, distorts cross-model comparisons, and misrepresents progress. We introduce ArenaBencher, a model-agnostic framework for automatic benchmark evolution that updates test cases while preserving comparability. Given an existing benchmark and a diverse pool of models to be evaluated, ArenaBencher infers the core ability of each test case, generates candidate question-answer pairs that preserve the original objective, verifies correctness and intent with an LLM as a judge, and aggregates feedback from multiple models to select candidates that expose shared weaknesses. The process runs iteratively with in-context demonstrations that steer generation toward more challenging and diagnostic cases. We apply ArenaBencher to math problem solving, commonsense reasoning, and safety domains and show that it produces verified, diverse, and fair updates that uncover new failure modes, increase difficulty while preserving test objective alignment, and improve model separability. The framework provides a scalable path to continuously evolve benchmarks in step with the rapid progress of foundation models.

Abstract: Scaling data and models has played a pivotal role in the remarkable progress of computer vision and language. Inspired by these domains, recent efforts in robotics have similarly focused on scaling both data and model size to develop more generalizable and robust policies. However, unlike vision and language, robotics lacks access to internet-scale demonstrations across diverse robotic tasks and environments. As a result, the scale of existing datasets typically suffers from the need for manual data collection and curation. To address this problem, here we propose BLAZER, a framework that learns manipulation policies from automatically generated training data. We build on the zero-shot capabilities of LLM planners and automatically generate demonstrations for diverse manipulation tasks in simulation. Successful examples are then used to finetune an LLM and to improve its planning capabilities without human supervision. Notably, while BLAZER training requires access to the simulator's state, we demonstrate direct transfer of acquired skills to sensor-based manipulation. Through extensive experiments, we show BLAZER to significantly improve zero-shot manipulation in both simulated and real environments. Moreover, BLAZER improves on tasks outside of its training pool and enables downscaling of LLM models. Our code and data will be made publicly available on the project page.

Abstract: The two fields of urban planning and artificial intelligence (AI) arose and developed separately. However, there is now cross-pollination and increasing interest in both fields to benefit from the advances of the other. In the present paper, we introduce the importance of urban planning from the sustainability, living, economic, disaster, and environmental perspectives. We review the fundamental concepts of urban planning and relate these concepts to crucial open problems of machine learning, including adversarial learning, generative neural networks, deep encoder-decoder networks, conversational AI, and geospatial and temporal machine learning, thereby assaying how AI can contribute to modern urban planning. Thus, a central problem is automated land-use configuration, which is formulated as the generation of land uses and building configuration for a target area from surrounding geospatial, human mobility, social media, environment, and economic activities. Finally, we delineate some implications of AI for urban planning and propose key research areas at the intersection of both topics.

Abstract: Integrating first-order logic constraints (FOLCs) with neural networks is a crucial but challenging problem since it involves modeling intricate correlations to satisfy the constraints. This paper proposes a novel neural layer, LogicMP, whose layers perform mean-field variational inference over an MLN. It can be plugged into any off-the-shelf neural network to encode FOLCs while retaining modularity and efficiency. By exploiting the structure and symmetries in MLNs, we theoretically demonstrate that our well-designed, efficient mean-field iterations effectively mitigate the difficulty of MLN inference, reducing the inference from sequential calculation to a series of parallel tensor operations. Empirical results in three kinds of tasks over graphs, images, and text show that LogicMP outperforms advanced competitors in both performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Our interest is in the design of software systems involving a human-expert interacting -- using natural language -- with a large language model (LLM) on data analysis tasks. For complex problems, it is possible that LLMs can harness human expertise and creativity to find solutions that were otherwise elusive. On one level, this interaction takes place through multiple turns of prompts from the human and responses from the LLM. Here we investigate a more structured approach based on an abstract protocol described in [3] for interaction between agents. The protocol is motivated by a notion of "two-way intelligibility" and is modelled by a pair of communicating finite-state machines. We provide an implementation of the protocol, and provide empirical evidence of using the implementation to mediate interactions between an LLM and a human-agent in two areas of scientific interest (radiology and drug design). We conduct controlled experiments with a human proxy (a database), and uncontrolled experiments with human subjects. The results provide evidence in support of the protocol's capability of capturing one- and two-way intelligibility in human-LLM interaction; and for the utility of two-way intelligibility in the design of human-machine systems. Our code is available at https://github.com/karannb/interact.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the identifiability of average controlled direct effects and average natural direct effects in causal systems represented by summary causal graphs, which are abstractions of full causal graphs, often used in dynamic systems where cycles and omitted temporal information complicate causal inference. Unlike in the traditional linear setting, where direct effects are typically easier to identify and estimate, non-parametric direct effects, which are crucial for handling real-world complexities, particularly in epidemiological contexts where relationships between variables (e.g, genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors) are often non-linear, are much harder to define and identify. In particular, we give sufficient conditions for identifying average controlled micro direct effect and average natural micro direct effect from summary causal graphs in the presence of hidden confounding. Furthermore, we show that the conditions given for the average controlled micro direct effect become also necessary in the setting where there is no hidden confounding and where we are only interested in identifiability by adjustment.

Abstract: Automated planning using a symbolic planning language, such as PDDL, is a general approach to producing optimal plans to achieve a stated goal. However, creating suitable machine understandable descriptions of the planning domain, problem, and goal requires expertise in the planning language, limiting the utility of these tools for non-expert humans. Recent efforts have explored utilizing a symbolic planner in conjunction with a large language model to generate plans from natural language descriptions given by a non-expert human (LLM+PDDL). Our approach performs initial translation of goal specifications to a set of PDDL goal constraints using an LLM; such translations often result in imprecise symbolic specifications, which are difficult to validate directly. We account for this using an evolutionary approach to generate a population of symbolic goal specifications with slight differences from the initial translation, and utilize a trained LSTM-based validation model to assess whether each induced plan in the population adheres to the natural language specifications. We evaluate our approach on a collection of prototypical specifications in a notional naval disaster recovery task, and demonstrate that our evolutionary approach improve adherence of generated plans to natural language specifications when compared to plans generated using only LLM translations. The code for our method can be found at https://github.com/owenonline/PlanCritic.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred growing interest in automatic theorem proving using Lean4, where effective tree search methods are crucial for navigating the underlying large proof search spaces. While the existing approaches primarily rely on value functions and/or Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), the potential of simpler methods like Best-First Tree Search (BFS) remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate whether BFS can achieve competitive performance in large-scale theorem proving tasks. We present BFS-Prover, a scalable expert iteration framework, featuring three key innovations. First, we implement strategic data filtering at each expert iteration round, excluding problems solvable via beam search node expansion to focus on harder cases. Second, we improve the sample efficiency of BFS through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) applied to state-tactic pairs automatically annotated with compiler error feedback, refining the LLM's policy to prioritize productive expansions. Third, we employ length normalization in BFS to encourage exploration of deeper proof paths. BFS-Prover achieves a state-of-the-art score of $72.95\%$ on the MiniF2F test set and therefore challenges the perceived necessity of complex tree search methods, demonstrating that BFS can achieve competitive performance when properly scaled. To facilitate further research and development in this area, we have open-sourced our model at https://huggingface.co/ByteDance-Seed/BFS-Prover-V1-7B.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) Agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in task automation and intelligent decision-making, driving the widespread adoption of agent development frameworks such as LangChain and AutoGen. However, these frameworks predominantly serve developers with extensive technical expertise - a significant limitation considering that only 0.03 % of the global population possesses the necessary programming skills. This stark accessibility gap raises a fundamental question: Can we enable everyone, regardless of technical background, to build their own LLM agents using natural language alone? To address this challenge, we introduce AutoAgent-a Fully-Automated and highly Self-Developing framework that enables users to create and deploy LLM agents through Natural Language Alone. Operating as an autonomous Agent Operating System, AutoAgent comprises four key components: i) Agentic System Utilities, ii) LLM-powered Actionable Engine, iii) Self-Managing File System, and iv) Self-Play Agent Customization module. This lightweight yet powerful system enables efficient and dynamic creation and modification of tools, agents, and workflows without coding requirements or manual intervention. Beyond its code-free agent development capabilities, AutoAgent also serves as a versatile multi-agent system for General AI Assistants. Comprehensive evaluations on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate AutoAgent's effectiveness in generalist multi-agent tasks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, AutoAgent's Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-related capabilities have shown consistently superior performance compared to many alternative LLM-based solutions.

Abstract: The Los Angeles wildfires of January 2025 caused more than 250 billion dollars in damage and lasted for nearly an entire month before containment. Following our previous work, the Digital Twin Building, we modify and leverage the multi-agent large language model framework as well as the cloud-mapping integration to study the air quality during the Los Angeles wildfires. Recent advances in large language models have allowed for out-of-the-box automated large-scale data analysis. We use a multi-agent large language system comprised of an Instructor agent and Worker agents. Upon receiving the users' instructions, the Instructor agent retrieves the data from the cloud platform and produces instruction prompts to the Worker agents. The Worker agents then analyze the data and provide summaries. The summaries are finally input back into the Instructor agent, which then provides the final data analysis. We test this system's capability for data-based policy recommendation by assessing our Instructor-Worker LLM system's health recommendations based on air quality during the Los Angeles wildfires.

Abstract: We propose a technology-agnostic, collaboration-ready stance for Human-AI Agents Collaboration Systems (HAACS) that closes long-standing gaps in prior stages (automation; flexible autonomy; agentic multi-agent collectives). Reading empirical patterns through a seven-dimension collaboration spine and human-agent contrasts, we identify missing pieces: principled budgeting of initiative, instantaneous and auditable reconfiguration, a system-wide knowledge backbone with an epistemic promotion gate, capacity-aware human interfaces; and, as a prerequisite to all of the above, unified definitions of agent and formal collaborative dynamics. We respond with (i) a boundary-centric ontology of agenthood synthesized with cybernetics; (ii) a Petri net family (colored and interpreted) that models ownership, cross-boundary interaction, concurrency, guards, and rates with collaboration transitions; and (iii) a three-level orchestration (meta, agent, execution) that governs behavior families via guard flips. On the knowledge side, we ground collaborative learning in Conversation Theory and SECI with teach-back gates and an evolving backbone; on the problem-solving side, we coordinate routine MEA-style control with practice-guided open-ended discovery. The result is the Hierarchical Exploration-Exploitation Net (HE2-Net): a policy-controlled stance that splits provisional from validated assets, promotes only after tests and peer checks, and budgets concurrent probing while keeping reuse fast and safe. We show interoperability with emerging agent protocols without ad hoc glue and sketch bio-cybernetic extensions (autopoiesis, autogenesis, evolving boundaries, synergetics, etc). Altogether, the framework keeps humans central to setting aims, justifying knowledge, and steering theory-practice dynamics, while scaling agents as reliable collaborators within audited governance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) promise to accelerate biomedical discovery, yet their reliability remains unclear. We introduce ARIEL (AI Research Assistant for Expert-in-the-Loop Learning), an open-source evaluation and optimization framework that pairs a curated multimodal biomedical corpus with expert-vetted tasks to probe two capabilities: full-length article summarization and fine-grained figure interpretation. Using uniform protocols and blinded PhD-level evaluation, we find that state-of-the-art models generate fluent but incomplete summaries, whereas LMMs struggle with detailed visual reasoning. We later observe that prompt engineering and lightweight fine-tuning substantially improve textual coverage, and a compute-scaled inference strategy enhances visual question answering. We build an ARIEL agent that integrates textual and visual cues, and we show it can propose testable mechanistic hypotheses. ARIEL delineates current strengths and limitations of foundation models, and provides a reproducible platform for advancing trustworthy AI in biomedicine.

Abstract: We study a sequential decision-making problem on a $n$-node graph $\mathcal{G}$ where each node has an unknown label from a finite set $\mathbf{\Omega}$, drawn from a joint distribution $\mathcal{P}$ that is Markov with respect to $\mathcal{G}$. At each step, selecting a node reveals its label and yields a label-dependent reward. The goal is to adaptively choose nodes to maximize expected accumulated discounted rewards. We impose a frontier exploration constraint, where actions are limited to neighbors of previously selected nodes, reflecting practical constraints in settings such as contact tracing and robotic exploration. We design a Gittins index-based policy that applies to general graphs and is provably optimal when $\mathcal{G}$ is a forest. Our implementation runs in $\mathcal{O}(n^2 \cdot |\mathbf{\Omega}|^2)$ time while using $\mathcal{O}(n \cdot |\mathbf{\Omega}|^2)$ oracle calls to $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{O}(n^2 \cdot |\mathbf{\Omega}|)$ space. Experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs show that our method consistently outperforms natural baselines, including in non-tree, budget-limited, and undiscounted settings. For example, in HIV testing simulations on real-world sexual interaction networks, our policy detects nearly all positive cases with only half the population tested, substantially outperforming other baselines.

Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs has garnered significant attention in both the mathematical and computer science communities. Recent works have made substantial progress in both Natural Language (NL) reasoning and Formal Language (FL) reasoning by leveraging the potential of pure Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods on base models. However, RL approaches struggle to impart new capabilities not presented in the base model, highlighting the need to integrate more knowledge like FL into NL math reasoning effectively. Yet, this integration is challenging due to inherent disparities in problem structure and reasoning format between NL and FL. To address these challenges, we introduce **NL-FL HybridReasoning (NFL-HR)**, an end-to-end framework designed to incorporate the FL expert into NL math problem-solving. To bridge the NL and FL input format gap, we propose the NL-FL Problem Alignment method, which reformulates the Question-Answering (QA) problems in NL as existence theorems in FL. Subsequently, the Mixed Problem Input technique we provide enables the FL reasoner to handle both QA and existence problems concurrently. Lastly, we mitigate the NL and FL output format gap in reasoning through an LLM-based Answer Extraction mechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the NFL-HR framework achieves **89.80**% and **84.34%** accuracy rates on the MATH-500 and the AMC benchmarks, surpassing the NL baseline by **4.60%** and **4.82%**, respectively. Notably, some problems resolved by our framework remain unsolved by the NL baseline model even under a larger number of trials.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with invoking enterprise APIs, yet they routinely falter when near-duplicate tools vie for the same user intent or when required arguments are left underspecified. We introduce DiaFORGE (Dialogue Framework for Organic Response Generation & Evaluation), a disambiguation-centric, three-stage pipeline that (i) synthesizes persona-driven, multi-turn dialogues in which the assistant must distinguish among highly similar tools, (ii) performs supervised fine-tuning of open-source models with reasoning traces across 3B - 70B parameters, and (iii) evaluates real-world readiness via a dynamic suite that redeploys each model in a live agentic loop and reports end-to-end goal completion alongside conventional static metrics. On our dynamic benchmark DiaBENCH, models trained with DiaFORGE raise tool-invocation success by 27 pp over GPT-4o and by 49 pp over Claude-3.5-Sonnet, both under optimized prompting. To spur further research, we release an open corpus of 5000 production-grade enterprise API specifications paired with rigorously validated, disambiguation-focused dialogues, offering a practical blueprint for building reliable, enterprise-ready tool-calling agents.

Abstract: Generative AI, large language models, and agentic AI have emerged separately of urban planning. However, the convergence between AI and urban planning presents an interesting opportunity towards AI urban planners. Existing studies conceptualizes urban planning as a generative AI task, where AI synthesizes land-use configurations under geospatial, social, and human-centric constraints and reshape automated urban design. We further identify critical gaps of existing generative urban planning studies: 1) the generative structure has to be predefined with strong assumption: all of adversarial generator-discriminator, forward and inverse diffusion structures, hierarchical zone-POI generative structure are predefined by humans; 2) ignore the power of domain expert developed tools: domain urban planners have developed various tools in the urban planning process guided by urban theory, while existing pure neural networks based generation ignore the power of the tools developed by urban planner practitioners. To address these limitations, we outline a future research direction agentic urban AI planner, calling for a new synthesis of agentic AI and participatory urbanism.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-agent systems highlight the potential of specialized small agents that collaborate via division of labor. Existing tool-integrated reasoning systems, however, often follow a single-agent paradigm in which one large model interleaves long-horizon reasoning with precise tool operations, leading to cognitive-load interference and unstable coordination. We present MSARL, a Multi-Small-Agent Reinforcement Learning framework that explicitly decouples reasoning from tool use. In MSARL, a Reasoning Agent decomposes problems and plans tool invocations, while multiple Tool Agents specialize in specific external tools, each trained via a combination of imitation learning and reinforcement learning with role-specific rewards. On mathematical problem solving with code execution, MSARL significantly improves reasoning stability and final-answer accuracy over single-agent baselines. Moreover, the architecture generalizes to diverse tool-use tasks, demonstrating that cognitive-role decoupling with small agents is a scalable blueprint for multi-agent AI design.

Abstract: An agent powered by large language models have achieved impressive results, but effectively handling the vast amounts of historical data generated during interactions remains a challenge. The current approach is to design a memory module for the agent to process these data. However, existing methods, such as MemoryBank and A-MEM, have poor quality of stored memory content, which affects recall performance and response quality. In order to better construct high-quality long-term memory content, we have designed a multiple memory system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes short-term memory to multiple long-term memory fragments, and constructs retrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these fragments, with a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase, MMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's query. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the context for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively utilizing historical data. Experiments on LoCoMo dataset compared our method with three others, proving its effectiveness. Ablation studies confirmed the rationality of our memory units. We also analyzed the robustness regarding the number of selected memory segments and the storage overhead, demonstrating its practical value.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into automated theorem proving has shown immense promise, yet is fundamentally constrained by challenges in scaling up both training-time reinforcement learning (RL) and inference-time compute. This paper introduces \texttt{BFS-Prover-V2}, a system designed to address this dual scaling problem. We present two primary innovations. The first is a novel multi-turn off-policy RL framework for continually improving the performance of LLM step-prover at training time. This framework, inspired by the principles of AlphaZero, utilizes a multi-stage expert iteration pipeline featuring adaptive tactic-level data filtering and periodic retraining to surmount the performance plateaus that typically curtail long-term RL in LLM-based agents. The second innovation is a planner-enhanced multi-agent search architecture that scales reasoning capabilities at inference time. This architecture employs a general reasoning model as a high-level planner to iteratively decompose complex theorems into a sequence of simpler subgoals. This hierarchical approach substantially reduces the search space, enabling a team of parallel prover agents to collaborate efficiently by leveraging a shared proof cache. We demonstrate that this dual approach to scaling yields state-of-the-art results on established formal mathematics benchmarks. \texttt{BFS-Prover-V2} achieves 95.08\% and 41.4\% on the MiniF2F and ProofNet test sets respectively. While demonstrated in the domain of formal mathematics, the RL and inference techniques presented in this work are of broader interest and may be applied to other domains requiring long-horizon multi-turn reasoning and complex search.

Abstract: The development of intelligent agents, particularly those powered by language models (LMs), has shown the critical role in various environments that require intelligent and autonomous decision. Environments are not passive testing grounds and they represent the data required for agents to learn and exhibit very challenging conditions that require adaptive, complex and autonomous capacity to make decisions. While the paradigm of scaling models and datasets has led to remarkable emergent capabilities, we argue that scaling the structure, fidelity, and logical consistency of agent reasoning within these environments is a crucial, yet underexplored, dimension of AI research. This paper introduces a neuro-symbolic multi-agent architecture where the belief states of individual agents are formally represented as Kripke models. This foundational choice enables them to reason about known concepts of \emph{possibility} and \emph{necessity} using the formal language of modal logic. In this work, we use of immutable, domain-specific knowledge to make infere information, which is encoded as logical constraints essential for proper diagnosis. In the proposed model, we show constraints that actively guide the hypothesis generation of LMs, effectively preventing them from reaching physically or logically untenable conclusions. In a high-fidelity simulated particle accelerator environment, our system successfully diagnoses complex, cascading failures by combining the powerful semantic intuition of LMs with the rigorous, verifiable validation of modal logic and a factual world model and showcasing a viable path toward more robust, reliable, and verifiable autonomous agents.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to software engineering (SWE), with SWE-bench as a key benchmark. Solutions are split into SWE-Agent frameworks with multi-turn interactions and workflow-based Agentless methods with single-turn verifiable steps. We argue these paradigms are not mutually exclusive: reasoning-intensive Agentless training induces skill priors, including localization, code edit, and self-reflection that enable efficient and effective SWE-Agent adaptation. In this work, we first curate the Agentless training recipe and present Kimi-Dev, an open-source SWE LLM achieving 60.4\% on SWE-bench Verified, the best among workflow approaches. With additional SFT adaptation on 5k publicly-available trajectories, Kimi-Dev powers SWE-Agents to 48.6\% pass@1, on par with that of Claude 3.5 Sonnet (241022 version). These results show that structured skill priors from Agentless training can bridge workflow and agentic frameworks for transferable coding agents.

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) often depends upon the choice of a sampling-based decoding strategy to probabilistically choose the next token at each generation step. While a variety of such sampling methods have been proposed, their performance can be sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which may require different settings depending upon the generation task and temperature configuration. In this work, we introduce $p$-less sampling: an information-theoretic approach to sampling which dynamically sets a truncation threshold at each decoding step based on the entire token probability distribution. Unlike existing methods, $p$-less sampling has no hyperparameters and consistently produces high-quality outputs as temperature increases. We provide theoretical perspectives on $p$-less sampling to ground our proposed method and conduct experiments to empirically validate its effectiveness across a range of math, logical reasoning, and creative writing tasks. Our results demonstrate how $p$-less sampling consistently outperforms existing sampling approaches while exhibiting much less degradation in text quality at higher temperature values. We further show how $p$-less achieves greater inference-time efficiency than alternative methods through lower average token sampling times and shorter generation lengths, without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we provide analyses to highlight the benefits of $p$-less through qualitative examples, case studies, and diversity assessments.

In this work, we propose a Spatial-Functional Awareness Transformer-based Graph Archetype Contrastive Learning (SFTG) framework to enhance EEG-based visual decoding. Specifically, we introduce the EEG Graph Transformer (EGT), a novel graph-based neural architecture that simultaneously encodes spatial brain connectivity and temporal neural dynamics. To mitigate high intra-subject variability, we propose Graph Archetype Contrastive Learning (GAC), which learns subject-specific EEG graph archetypes to improve feature consistency and class separability. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive subject-dependent and subject-independent evaluations on the Things-EEG dataset, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art EEG decoding methods.The results underscore the transformative potential of integrating graph-based learning with contrastive objectives to enhance EEG-based brain decoding, paving the way for more generalizable and robust neural representations.

Abstract: Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT can fundamentally change the way investors process information. We probe the economic usefulness of these tools in summarizing complex corporate disclosures using the stock market as a laboratory. The unconstrained summaries are remarkably shorter compared to the originals, whereas their information content is amplified. When a document has a positive (negative) sentiment, its summary becomes more positive (negative). Importantly, the summaries are more effective at explaining stock market reactions to the disclosed information. Motivated by these findings, we propose a measure of information ``bloat." We show that bloated disclosure is associated with adverse capital market consequences, such as lower price efficiency and higher information asymmetry. Finally, we show that the model is effective at constructing targeted summaries that identify firms' (non-)financial performance. Collectively, our results indicate that generative AI adds considerable value for investors with information processing constraints.

Abstract: Predicting and reasoning about the future lie at the heart of many time-series questions. For example, goal-conditioned reinforcement learning can be viewed as learning representations to predict which states are likely to be visited in the future. While prior methods have used contrastive predictive coding to model time series data, learning representations that encode long-term dependencies usually requires large amounts of data. In this paper, we introduce a temporal difference version of contrastive predictive coding that stitches together pieces of different time series data to decrease the amount of data required to learn predictions of future events. We apply this representation learning method to derive an off-policy algorithm for goal-conditioned RL. Experiments demonstrate that, compared with prior RL methods, ours achieves $2 \times$ median improvement in success rates and can better cope with stochastic environments. In tabular settings, we show that our method is about $20 \times$ more sample efficient than the successor representation and $1500 \times$ more sample efficient than the standard (Monte Carlo) version of contrastive predictive coding.

Abstract: Smart glasses are rapidly gaining advanced functions thanks to cutting-edge computing technologies, especially accelerated hardware architectures, and tiny Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms. However, integrating AI into smart glasses featuring a small form factor and limited battery capacity remains challenging for a satisfactory user experience. To this end, this paper proposes the design of a smart glasses platform for always-on on-device object detection with an all-day battery lifetime. The proposed platform is based on GAP9, a novel multi-core RISC-V processor from Greenwaves Technologies. Additionally, a family of sub-million parameter TinyissimoYOLO networks are proposed. They are benchmarked on established datasets, capable of differentiating up to 80 classes on MS-COCO. Evaluations on the smart glasses prototype demonstrate TinyissimoYOLO's inference latency of only 17ms and consuming 1.59mJ energy per inference. An end-to-end latency of 56ms is achieved which is equivalent to 18 frames per seconds (FPS) with a total power consumption of 62.9mW. This ensures continuous system runtime of up to 9.3 hours on a 154mAh battery. These results outperform MCUNet (TinyNAS+TinyEngine), which runs a simpler task (image classification) at just 7.3 FPS, while the 18 FPS achieved in this paper even include image-capturing, network inference, and detection post-processing. The algorithm's code is released open with this paper and can be found here: https://github.com/ETH-PBL/TinyissimoYOLO

Abstract: In the largest survey of its kind, 2,778 researchers who had published in top-tier artificial intelligence (AI) venues gave predictions on the pace of AI progress and the nature and impacts of advanced AI systems The aggregate forecasts give at least a 50% chance of AI systems achieving several milestones by 2028, including autonomously constructing a payment processing site from scratch, creating a song indistinguishable from a new song by a popular musician, and autonomously downloading and fine-tuning a large language model. If science continues undisrupted, the chance of unaided machines outperforming humans in every possible task was estimated at 10% by 2027, and 50% by 2047. The latter estimate is 13 years earlier than that reached in a similar survey we conducted only one year earlier [Grace et al., 2022]. However, the chance of all human occupations becoming fully automatable was forecast to reach 10% by 2037, and 50% as late as 2116 (compared to 2164 in the 2022 survey).
  Most respondents expressed substantial uncertainty about the long-term value of AI progress: While 68.3% thought good outcomes from superhuman AI are more likely than bad, of these net optimists 48% gave at least a 5% chance of extremely bad outcomes such as human extinction, and 59% of net pessimists gave 5% or more to extremely good outcomes. Between 38% and 51% of respondents gave at least a 10% chance to advanced AI leading to outcomes as bad as human extinction. More than half suggested that "substantial" or "extreme" concern is warranted about six different AI-related scenarios, including misinformation, authoritarian control, and inequality. There was disagreement about whether faster or slower AI progress would be better for the future of humanity. However, there was broad agreement that research aimed at minimizing potential risks from AI systems ought to be prioritized more.

Abstract: Limited access to mental healthcare resources hinders timely depression diagnosis, leading to detrimental outcomes. Social media platforms present a valuable data source for early detection, yet this task faces two significant challenges: 1) the need for medical knowledge to distinguish clinical depression from transient mood changes, and 2) the dual requirement for high accuracy and model explainability. To address this, we propose DORIS, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs). To integrate medical knowledge, DORIS utilizes LLMs to annotate user texts against established medical diagnostic criteria and to summarize historical posts into temporal mood courses. These medically-informed features are then used to train an accurate Gradient Boosting Tree (GBT) classifier. Explainability is achieved by generating justifications for predictions based on the LLM-derived symptom annotations and mood course analyses. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness as well as interpretability of our method, highlighting its potential as a supportive clinical tool.

Abstract: Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is a critical task for ensuring the safety and reliability of civil infrastructures, typically realized on bridges and viaducts by means of vibration monitoring. In this paper, we propose for the first time the use of Transformer neural networks, with a Masked Auto-Encoder architecture, as Foundation Models for SHM. We demonstrate the ability of these models to learn generalizable representations from multiple large datasets through self-supervised pre-training, which, coupled with task-specific fine-tuning, allows them to outperform state-of-the-art traditional methods on diverse tasks, including Anomaly Detection (AD) and Traffic Load Estimation (TLE). We then extensively explore model size versus accuracy trade-offs and experiment with Knowledge Distillation (KD) to improve the performance of smaller Transformers, enabling their embedding directly into the SHM edge nodes.
  We showcase the effectiveness of our foundation models using data from three operational viaducts. For AD, we achieve a near-perfect 99.9% accuracy with a monitoring time span of just 15 windows. In contrast, a state-of-the-art method based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) obtains its first good result (95.03% accuracy), only considering 120 windows. On two different TLE tasks, our models obtain state-of-the-art performance on multiple evaluation metrics (R$^2$ score, MAE% and MSE%). On the first benchmark, we achieve an R$^2$ score of 0.97 and 0.90 for light and heavy vehicle traffic, respectively, while the best previous approach (a Random Forest) stops at 0.91 and 0.84. On the second one, we achieve an R$^2$ score of 0.54 versus the 0.51 of the best competitor method, a Long-Short Term Memory network.

Abstract: Wearable sensors and IoT/IoMT platforms enable continuous, real-time monitoring, but objective digital markers for eating disorders are limited. In this study, we examined whether actimetry and machine learning (ML) could provide objective criteria for food addiction (FA) and symptom counts (SC). In 78 participants (mean age 22.1 +/- 9.5 y; 73.1% women), one week of non-dominant wrist actimetry and psychometric data (YFAS, DEBQ, ZSDS) were collected. The time series were segmented into daytime activity and nighttime rest, and statistical and entropy descriptors (FuzzyEn, DistEn, SVDEn, PermEn, PhaseEn; 256 features) were calculated. The mean Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) was used as the primary metric in a K-nearest neighbors (KNN) pipeline with five-fold stratified cross-validation (one hundred repetitions; 500 evaluations); SHAP was used to assist in interpretation. For binary FA, activity-segment features performed best (MCC = 0.78 +/- 0.02; Accuracy ~ 95.3% +/- 0.5; Sensitivity ~ 0.77 +/- 0.03; Specificity ~ 0.98 +/- 0.004), exceeding OaS (Objective and Subjective Features) (MCC = 0.69 +/- 0.03) and rest-only (MCC = 0.50 +/- 0.03). For SC (four classes), OaS slightly surpassed actimetry (MCC = 0.40 +/- 0.01 vs 0.38 +/- 0.01; Accuracy ~ 58.1% vs 56.9%). Emotional and restrained eating were correlated with actimetric features. These findings support wrist-worn actimetry as a digital biomarker of FA that complements questionnaires and may facilitate privacy-preserving clinical translation.

Abstract: Molecular sequence analysis is crucial for comprehending several biological processes, including protein-protein interactions, functional annotation, and disease classification. The large number of sequences and the inherently complicated nature of protein structures make it challenging to analyze such data. Finding patterns and enhancing subsequent research requires the use of dimensionality reduction and feature selection approaches. Recently, a method called Correlated Clustering and Projection (CCP) has been proposed as an effective method for biological sequencing data. The CCP technique is still costly to compute even though it is effective for sequence visualization. Furthermore, its utility for classifying molecular sequences is still uncertain. To solve these two problems, we present a Nearest Neighbor Correlated Clustering and Projection (CCP-NN)-based technique for efficiently preprocessing molecular sequence data. To group related molecular sequences and produce representative supersequences, CCP makes use of sequence-to-sequence correlations. As opposed to conventional methods, CCP doesn't rely on matrix diagonalization, therefore it can be applied to a range of machine-learning problems. We estimate the density map and compute the correlation using a nearest-neighbor search technique. We performed molecular sequence classification using CCP and CCP-NN representations to assess the efficacy of our proposed approach. Our findings show that CCP-NN considerably improves classification task accuracy as well as significantly outperforms CCP in terms of computational runtime.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is increasingly recognized as an effective approach to mitigating the hallucination of large language models (LLMs) through the integration of external knowledge. While numerous efforts, most studies focus on a single type of external knowledge source. However, in real-world applications, most situations involve diverse knowledge from various sources, yet this area has been less explored. The main dilemma is the lack of a suitable dataset containing multiple knowledge sources and pre-exploration of the associated issues. To address these challenges, we standardize a benchmark dataset that combines structured and unstructured knowledge across diverse and complementary domains. Based on this dataset, we further develop a plug-and-play RAG framework, \textbf{PruningRAG}, whose main characteristic is the use of multi-granularity pruning strategies to optimize the integration of relevant information while minimizing misleading context. It consistently improves performance across various existing RAG variants, demonstrating its robustness and broad applicability. Building upon the standardized dataset and PruningRAG, we also report a series of experimental results, as well as insightful findings. Our dataset and code are publicly available\footnote{https://github.com/USTCAGI/PruningRAG}, with the aim of advancing future research in the RAG community.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization is ubiquitous in experimental design and black-box optimization for improving search efficiency. However, most existing approaches rely on regression models which are limited to fixed search spaces and structured, tabular input features. This paper explores the use of LLM embeddings over string inputs for in-context regression in Bayesian Optimization. Our results show that representing inputs as strings enables general-purpose regression across diverse domains, including synthetic, combinatorial, and hyperparameter optimization. Furthermore, our approach achieves optimization performance comparable to state-of-the-art Gaussian Process-based methods such as Google Vizier, and demonstrates potential for broader and more flexible applications.

Abstract: One of the biggest challenges of building artificial intelligence (AI) model in the healthcare area is the data sharing. Since healthcare data is private, sensitive, and heterogeneous, collecting sufficient data for modelling is exhausting, costly, and sometimes impossible. In this paper, we propose a framework for global healthcare modelling using datasets from multi-continents (Europe, North America, and Asia) without sharing the local datasets, and choose glucose management as a study model to verify its effectiveness. Technically, blockchain-enabled federated learning is implemented with adaptation to meet the privacy and safety requirements of healthcare data, meanwhile, it rewards honest participation and penalizes malicious activities using its on-chain incentive mechanism. Experimental results show that the proposed framework is effective, efficient, and privacy-preserving. Its prediction accuracy consistently outperforms models trained on limited personal data and achieves comparable or even slightly better results than centralized training in certain scenarios, all while preserving data privacy. This work paves the way for international collaborations on healthcare projects, where additional data is crucial for reducing bias and providing benefits to humanity.

Abstract: Despite the impressive generative abilities of black-box large language models (LLMs), their inherent opacity hinders further advancements in capabilities such as reasoning, planning, and personalization. Existing works aim to enhance LLM capabilities via domain-specific adaptation, which require additional training on accessible model parameters, an infeasible option for black-box LLMs. To address this challenge, we introduce Matryoshka Pilot (M-Pilot), a lightweight white-box LLM controller that guides a large-scale black-box LLM generator by decomposing complex tasks into a series of intermediate outputs. Specifically, we consider the black-box LLM as an environment, with M-Pilot serving as a policy to provide intermediate guidance through prompts for driving the black-box LLM. M-Pilot is trained to pivot the outputs of the black-box LLM aligning with preferences during iterative interaction, which enables controllable multi-turn generation and self-improvement in optimizing intermediate guidance. Empirical evaluations on diverse tasks demonstrate that our method effectively enhances the capabilities of black-box LLMs in complex, long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: Rapid advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred demand for processing extended context sequences in contemporary applications. However, this progress faces two challenges: performance degradation due to sequence lengths out-of-distribution, and excessively long inference times caused by the quadratic computational complexity of attention. These issues limit LLMs in long-context scenarios. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Token-Level KV Cache Selection (TokenSelect), a training-free method for efficient and accurate long-context inference. TokenSelect builds upon the observation of non-contiguous attention sparsity, using QK dot products to measure per-head KV Cache criticality at token-level. By per-head soft voting mechanism, TokenSelect selectively involves a few critical KV cache tokens in attention calculation without sacrificing accuracy. To further accelerate TokenSelect, we design the Selection Cache based on observations of consecutive Query similarity and implemented the efficient Paged Dot Product Kernel, significantly reducing the selection overhead. A comprehensive evaluation of TokenSelect demonstrates up to $23.84\times$ speedup in attention computation and up to $2.28\times$ acceleration in end-to-end latency, while providing superior performance compared to state-of-the-art long-context inference methods.

Abstract: Standard clothing asset generation involves restoring forward-facing flat-lay garment images displayed on a clear background by extracting clothing information from diverse real-world contexts, which presents significant challenges due to highly standardized structure sampling distributions and clothing semantic absence in complex scenarios. Existing models have limited spatial perception, often exhibiting structural hallucinations and texture distortion in this high-specification generative task. To address this issue, we propose a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, termed RAGDiffusion, to enhance structure determinacy and mitigate hallucinations by assimilating knowledge from language models and external databases. RAGDiffusion consists of two processes: (1) Retrieval-based structure aggregation, which employs contrastive learning and a Structure Locally Linear Embedding (SLLE) to derive global structure and spatial landmarks, providing both soft and hard guidance to counteract structural ambiguities; and (2) Omni-level faithful garment generation, which introduces a coarse-to-fine texture alignment that ensures fidelity in pattern and detail components within the diffusing. Extensive experiments on challenging real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGDiffusion synthesizes structurally and texture-faithful clothing assets with significant performance improvements, representing a pioneering effort in high-specification faithful generation with RAG to confront intrinsic hallucinations and enhance fidelity.

Abstract: Binary classification tasks with imbalanced classes pose significant challenges in machine learning. Traditional classifiers often struggle to accurately capture the characteristics of the minority class, resulting in biased models with subpar predictive performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to tackle this issue by leveraging Universum points to support the minority class within quadratic twin support vector machine models. Unlike traditional classifiers, our models utilize quadratic surfaces instead of hyperplanes for binary classification, providing greater flexibility in modeling complex decision boundaries. By incorporating Universum points, our approach enhances classification accuracy and generalization performance on imbalanced datasets. We generated four artificial datasets to demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed methods. Additionally, we validated the effectiveness of our approach through empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets, showing superior performance compared to conventional classifiers and existing methods for imbalanced classification.

Abstract: With Large Language Models (LLMs) recently demonstrating impressive proficiency in code generation, it is promising to extend their abilities to Hardware Description Language (HDL). However, LLMs tend to generate single HDL code blocks rather than hierarchical structures for hardware designs, leading to hallucinations, particularly in complex designs like Domain-Specific Accelerators (DSAs). To address this, we propose HiVeGen, a hierarchical LLM-based Verilog generation framework that decomposes generation tasks into LLM-manageable hierarchical submodules. HiVeGen further harnesses the advantages of such hierarchical structures by integrating automatic Design Space Exploration (DSE) into hierarchy-aware prompt generation, introducing weight-based retrieval to enhance code reuse, and enabling real-time human-computer interaction to lower error-correction cost, significantly improving the quality of generated designs.

Abstract: Existing methods for code generation use code snippets as seed data, restricting the complexity and diversity of the synthesized data. In this paper, we introduce a novel feature tree-based synthesis framework, which revolves around hierarchical code features derived from high-level abstractions of code. The feature tree is constructed from raw data and refined iteratively to increase the quantity and diversity of the extracted features, which captures and recognizes more complex patterns and relationships within the code. By adjusting the depth and breadth of the sampled subtrees, our framework provides precise control over the complexity of the generated code, enabling functionalities that range from function-level operations to multi-file scenarios. We fine-tuned widely-used base models to obtain EpiCoder series, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks at both the function and file levels. In particular, empirical evidence indicates that our approach shows significant potential in the synthesizing of repository-level code data. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/EpiCoder.

Abstract: Disaster events occur around the world and cause significant damage to human life and property. Earth observation (EO) data enables rapid and comprehensive building damage assessment (BDA), an essential capability in the aftermath of a disaster to reduce human casualties and to inform disaster relief efforts. Recent research focuses on the development of AI models to achieve accurate mapping of unseen disaster events, mostly using optical EO data. However, solutions based on optical data are limited to clear skies and daylight hours, preventing a prompt response to disasters. Integrating multimodal (MM) EO data, particularly the combination of optical and SAR imagery, makes it possible to provide all-weather, day-and-night disaster responses. Despite this potential, the development of robust multimodal AI models has been constrained by the lack of suitable benchmark datasets. In this paper, we present a BDA dataset using veRy-hIGH-resoluTion optical and SAR imagery (BRIGHT) to support AI-based all-weather disaster response. To the best of our knowledge, BRIGHT is the first open-access, globally distributed, event-diverse MM dataset specifically curated to support AI-based disaster response. It covers five types of natural disasters and two types of man-made disasters across 14 regions worldwide, with a particular focus on developing countries where external assistance is most needed. The optical and SAR imagery in BRIGHT, with a spatial resolution between 0.3-1 meters, provides detailed representations of individual buildings, making it ideal for precise BDA. In our experiments, we have tested seven advanced AI models trained with our BRIGHT to validate the transferability and robustness. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/ChenHongruixuan/BRIGHT. BRIGHT also serves as the official dataset for the 2025 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in language understanding and reasoning across diverse domains. Recently, there has been increasing interest in utilizing LLMs not merely as assistants in optimization tasks, but as primary optimizers, particularly for network-structured combinatorial problems. However, before LLMs can be reliably deployed in this role, a fundamental question must be addressed: Can LLMs iteratively manipulate solutions that consistently adhere to problem constraints? In this work, we propose a systematic framework to evaluate the capability of LLMs to engage with problem structures. Rather than treating the model as a black-box generator, we adopt the commonly used evolutionary optimizer (EVO) and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework that rigorously assesses the output fidelity of LLM-based operators across different stages of the evolutionary process. To enhance robustness, we introduce a hybrid error-correction mechanism that mitigates uncertainty in LLMs outputs. Moreover, we explore a cost-efficient population-level optimization strategy that significantly improves efficiency compared to traditional individual-level approaches. Extensive experiments on a representative node-level combinatorial network optimization task demonstrate the effectiveness, adaptability, and inherent limitations of LLM-based EVO. Our findings present perspectives on integrating LLMs into evolutionary computation and discuss paths that may support scalable and context-aware optimization in networked systems.

Abstract: Meta-reinforcement learning (Meta-RL) facilitates rapid adaptation to unseen tasks but faces challenges in long-horizon environments. Skill-based approaches tackle this by decomposing state-action sequences into reusable skills and employing hierarchical decision-making. However, these methods are highly susceptible to noisy offline demonstrations, leading to unstable skill learning and degraded performance. To address this, we propose Self-Improving Skill Learning (SISL), which performs self-guided skill refinement using decoupled high-level and skill improvement policies, while applying skill prioritization via maximum return relabeling to focus updates on task-relevant trajectories, resulting in robust and stable adaptation even under noisy and suboptimal data. By mitigating the effect of noise, SISL achieves reliable skill learning and consistently outperforms other skill-based meta-RL methods on diverse long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion models have quickly become the state-of-the-art for numerous generation tasks across many different applications. Encoding samples from the data distribution back into the models underlying prior distribution is an important task that arises in many downstream applications. This task is often called the inversion of diffusion models. Prior approaches for solving this task, however, are often simple heuristic solvers that come with several drawbacks in practice. In this work, we propose a new family of solvers for diffusion models by exploiting the connection between this task and the broader study of algebraically reversible solvers for differential equations. In particular, we construct a family of reversible solvers using an application of Lawson methods to construct exponential Runge-Kutta methods for the diffusion models. We call this family of reversible exponential solvers Rex. In addition to a rigorous theoretical analysis of the proposed solvers we also emonstrate the utility of the methods through a variety of empirical illustrations.

Abstract: Linear sequence modeling methods, such as linear attention, state space modeling, and linear RNNs, offer significant efficiency improvements by reducing the complexity of training and inference. However, these methods typically compress the entire input sequence into a single fixed-size memory state, which leads to suboptimal performance on recall-intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel architecture called Mixture-of-Memories (MoM). MoM utilizes multiple independent memory states, with a router network directing input tokens to specific memory states. This approach greatly enhances the overall memory capacity while minimizing memory interference. MoM serves as a general framework that can be seamlessly combined with diverse memory update mechanisms across linear models. As a result, MoM performs exceptionally well on recall-intensive tasks, surpassing existing linear sequence modeling techniques. Despite incorporating multiple memory states, the computation of each memory state remains linear in complexity, allowing MoM to retain the linear-complexity advantage during training, while constant-complexity during inference. Our experimental results show that MoM outperforms current linear sequence models on downstream language tasks, particularly recall-intensive tasks, and even achieves performance comparable to Transformer models. The code is released at https://github.com/OpenSparseLLMs/MoM and is also released as a part of https://github.com/OpenSparseLLMs/Linear-MoE.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents show great promise in accelerating scientific research. Existing benchmarks for measuring this potential and guiding future development continue to evolve from pure recall and rote knowledge tasks, towards more practical work such as literature review and experimental planning. Bioinformatics is a domain where fully autonomous AI-driven discovery may be near, but no extensive benchmarks for measuring progress have been introduced to date. We therefore present the Bioinformatics Benchmark (BixBench), a dataset comprising over 50 real-world scenarios of practical biological data analysis with nearly 300 associated open-answer questions designed to measure the ability of LLM-based agents to explore biological datasets, perform long, multi-step analytical trajectories, and interpret the nuanced results of those analyses. We evaluate the performance of two frontier LLMs (GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) using a custom agent framework we open source. We find that even the latest frontier models only achieve 17% accuracy in the open-answer regime, and no better than random in a multiple-choice setting. By exposing the current limitations of frontier models, we hope BixBench can spur the development of agents capable of conducting rigorous bioinformatic analysis and accelerate scientific discovery.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination stemming from misaligned self-awareness, particularly when processing queries exceeding their knowledge boundaries. While existing mitigation strategies employ uncertainty estimation or query rejection mechanisms, they suffer from computational efficiency and sacrificed helpfulness. To address these issues, we propose the Explicit Knowledge Boundary Modeling (EKBM) framework, integrating fast and slow reasoning systems to harmonize reliability and usability. The framework first employs a fast-thinking model to generate confidence-labeled responses, enabling immediate utilization of high-confidence outputs, whereas uncertain predictions trigger a slow refinement model for accuracy improvement. To align model behavior with our proposed object, we propose a hybrid training pipeline, enhancing self-awareness without degrading task performance. Evaluations on dialogue state tracking tasks demonstrate that EKBM achieves superior model reliability over uncertainty-based baselines. Further analysis reveals that refinement substantially boosts accuracy while maintaining low computational overhead. The framework establishes a scalable paradigm for deploying reliable LLMs in error-sensitive applications, effectively balancing accuracy and practical utility.

<title>Teaching Your Models to Understand Code via Focal Preference Alignment</title>

Abstract: Preference learning extends the performance of Code LLMs beyond traditional supervised fine-tuning by leveraging relative quality comparisons. In existing approaches, a set of n candidate solutions is evaluated based on test case success rates, with the candidate demonstrating a higher pass rate being labeled as positive and its counterpart with a lower pass rate as negative. However, because this approach aligns entire failing code blocks rather than pinpointing specific errors, it lacks the granularity necessary to capture meaningful error-correction relationships. As a result, the model is unable to learn more informative error-correction patterns. To address these issues, we propose Target-DPO, a new preference alignment framework that mimics human iterative debugging to refine Code LLMs. Target-DPO explicitly locates error regions and aligns the corresponding tokens via a tailored DPO algorithm. To facilitate it, we introduce the CodeFlow dataset, where samples are iteratively refined until passing tests, with modifications capturing error corrections. Extensive experiments show that a diverse suite of Code LLMs equipped with Target-DPO achieves significant performance gains in code generation and improves on challenging tasks like BigCodeBench. In-depth analysis reveals that Target-DPO yields fewer errors. Code, model and datasets are in: https://github.com/JieWu02/Target-DPO.

Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has given rise to four major application paradigms: LLM app stores, LLM agents, self-hosted LLM services, and LLM-powered devices. Each has its advantages but also shares common challenges. LLM app stores lower the barrier to development but lead to platform lock-in; LLM agents provide autonomy but lack a unified communication mechanism; self-hosted LLM services enhance control but increase deployment complexity; and LLM-powered devices improve privacy and real-time performance but are limited by hardware. This paper reviews and analyzes these paradigms, covering architecture design, application ecosystem, research progress, as well as the challenges and open problems they face. Based on this, we outline the next frontier of LLM applications, characterizing them through three interconnected layers: infrastructure, protocol, and application. We describe their responsibilities and roles of each layer and demonstrate how to mitigate existing fragmentation limitations and improve security and scalability. Finally, we discuss key future challenges, identify opportunities such as protocol-driven cross-platform collaboration and device integration, and propose a research roadmap for openness, security, and sustainability.

Abstract: Bilevel reinforcement learning (BRL) has emerged as a powerful framework for aligning generative models, yet its theoretical foundations, especially sample complexity bounds, remain underexplored. In this work, we present the first sample complexity bound for BRL, establishing a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ in continuous state-action spaces. Traditional MDP analysis techniques do not extend to BRL due to its nested structure and non-convex lower-level problems. We overcome these challenges by leveraging the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) condition and the MDP structure to obtain closed-form gradients, enabling tight sample complexity analysis. Our analysis also extends to general bi-level optimization settings with non-convex lower levels, where we achieve state-of-the-art sample complexity results of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ improving upon existing bounds of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-6})$. Additionally, we address the computational bottleneck of hypergradient estimation by proposing a fully first-order, Hessian-free algorithm suitable for large-scale problems.

Abstract: AI-generated images have become so good in recent years that individuals often cannot distinguish them any more from "real" images. This development, combined with the rapid spread of AI-generated content online, creates a series of societal risks. Watermarking, a technique that involves embedding information within images and other content to indicate their AI-generated nature, has emerged as a primary mechanism to address the risks posed by AI-generated content. Indeed, watermarking and AI labelling measures are now becoming a legal requirement in many jurisdictions, including under the 2024 European Union AI Act. Despite the widespread use of AI image generation systems, the practical implications and the current status of implementation of these measures remain largely unexamined. The present paper therefore provides both an empirical and a legal analysis of these measures. In our legal analysis, we identify four categories of generative AI deployment scenarios and outline how the legal obligations could apply in each category. In our empirical analysis, we find that only a minority number of AI image generators currently implement adequate watermarking (38%) and deep fake labelling (18%) practices. In response, we suggest a range of avenues of how the implementation of these legally mandated techniques can be improved, and publicly share our tooling for the detection of watermarks in images.

Abstract: We introduce the Entropy-Driven Uncertainty Process Reward Model (EDU-PRM), a novel entropy-driven training framework for process reward modeling that enables dynamic, uncertainty-aligned segmentation of complex reasoning steps, eliminating the need for costly manual step annotations. Unlike previous Process Reward Models (PRMs) that rely on static partitioning and human labeling, EDU-PRM automatically anchors step boundaries at tokens with high predictive entropy, effectively capturing intrinsic logical transitions and facilitating efficient exploration of diverse reasoning paths. On the ProcessBench benchmark, EDU-PRM outperforms strong public PRM baselines, such as Math-Shepherd PRM and Omega PRM, and EDU-PRM achieves comparable results with SOTA models while only using 1.5% training data. Furthermore, by leveraging our proposed EDU sampling strategy, we observe accuracy boosts from 64.7% to 67.3% for generative reasoning tasks, accompanied by a reduction of 32% in token usage. These findings underscore the potential of EDU-PRM as a scalable and annotation-efficient paradigm for process supervision in mathematical reasoning, paving the way for more efficient and robust approaches to complex mathematical problem solving.

Abstract: Various layer-skipping methods have been proposed to accelerate token generation in large language models (LLMs). However, limited attention has been paid to a fundamental question: How do computational demands vary across the generation of different tokens? In this work, we introduce FlexiDepth, a method that dynamically adjusts the number of Transformer layers used in text generation. By incorporating a plug-in router and adapter, FlexiDepth enables adaptive computation in LLMs without modifying their original parameters. Applied to Llama-3-8B, it skips 8 out of 32 layers while maintaining full benchmark performance. Our experiments reveal that computational demands in LLMs significantly vary based on token type. Specifically, generating repetitive tokens or fixed phrases requires fewer layers, whereas producing tokens involving computation or high uncertainty requires more layers. Despite the computational savings, FlexiDepth does not yet achieve wall-clock speedup due to varied skipping patterns and I/O overhead. To inspire future work and advance research on practical speedup, we open-sourced FlexiDepth and a dataset documenting its layer allocation patterns.

Abstract: Most discussions about Large Language Model (LLM) safety have focused on single-agent settings but multi-agent LLM systems now create novel adversarial risks because their behavior depends on communication between agents and decentralized reasoning. In this work, we innovatively focus on attacking pragmatic systems that have constrains such as limited token bandwidth, latency between message delivery, and defense mechanisms. We design a $\textit{permutation-invariant adversarial attack}$ that optimizes prompt distribution across latency and bandwidth-constraint network topologies to bypass distributed safety mechanisms within the system. Formulating the attack path as a problem of $\textit{maximum-flow minimum-cost}$, coupled with the novel $\textit{Permutation-Invariant Evasion Loss (PIEL)}$, we leverage graph-based optimization to maximize attack success rate while minimizing detection risk. Evaluating across models including $\texttt{Llama}$, $\texttt{Mistral}$, $\texttt{Gemma}$, $\texttt{DeepSeek}$ and other variants on various datasets like $\texttt{JailBreakBench}$ and $\texttt{AdversarialBench}$, our method outperforms conventional attacks by up to $7\times$, exposing critical vulnerabilities in multi-agent systems. Moreover, we demonstrate that existing defenses, including variants of $\texttt{Llama-Guard}$ and $\texttt{PromptGuard}$, fail to prohibit our attack, emphasizing the urgent need for multi-agent specific safety mechanisms.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which integrate vision and other modalities into Large Language Models (LLMs), significantly enhance AI capabilities but also introduce new security vulnerabilities. By exploiting the vulnerabilities of the visual modality and the long-tail distribution characteristic of code training data, we present PiCo, a novel jailbreaking framework designed to progressively bypass multi-tiered defense mechanisms in advanced MLLMs. PiCo employs a tier-by-tier jailbreak strategy, using token-level typographic attacks to evade input filtering and embedding harmful intent within programming context instructions to bypass runtime monitoring. To comprehensively assess the impact of attacks, a new evaluation metric is further proposed to assess both the toxicity and helpfulness of model outputs post-attack. By embedding harmful intent within code-style visual instructions, PiCo achieves an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 84.13% on Gemini-Pro Vision and 52.66% on GPT-4, surpassing previous methods. Experimental results highlight the critical gaps in current defenses, underscoring the need for more robust strategies to secure advanced MLLMs.

Abstract: This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) for annotating document utility in training retrieval and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, aiming to reduce dependence on costly human annotations. We address the gap between retrieval relevance and generative utility by employing LLMs to annotate document utility. To effectively utilize multiple positive samples per query, we introduce a novel loss that maximizes their summed marginal likelihood. Using the Qwen-2.5-32B model, we annotate utility on the MS MARCO dataset and conduct retrieval experiments on MS MARCO and BEIR, as well as RAG experiments on MS MARCO QA, NQ, and HotpotQA. Our results show that LLM-generated annotations enhance out-of-domain retrieval performance and improve RAG outcomes compared to models trained solely on human annotations or downstream QA metrics. Furthermore, combining LLM annotations with just 20% of human labels achieves performance comparable to using full human annotations. Our study offers a comprehensive approach to utilizing LLM annotations for initializing QA systems on new corpora.

Abstract: Hallucination, i.e., generating factually incorrect content, remains a critical challenge for large language models (LLMs). We introduce TOHA, a TOpology-based HAllucination detector in the RAG setting, which leverages a topological divergence metric to quantify the structural properties of graphs induced by attention matrices. Examining the topological divergence between prompt and response subgraphs reveals consistent patterns: higher divergence values in specific attention heads correlate with hallucinated outputs, independent of the dataset. Extensive experiments - including evaluation on question answering and summarization tasks - show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art or competitive results on several benchmarks while requiring minimal annotated data and computational resources. Our findings suggest that analyzing the topological structure of attention matrices can serve as an efficient and robust indicator of factual reliability in LLMs.

Abstract: The specialized vocabulary and nuanced concepts of the telecommunications industry pose persistent challenges for standard Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. Generic embedding models often struggle to represent telecom-specific semantics, limiting their utility in retrieval and downstream tasks. We present T-VEC (Telecom Vectorization Model), a domain-adapted embedding model fine-tuned from the gte-Qwen2-1.5B-instruct backbone using a triplet loss objective. Fine-tuning was performed on T-Embed, a high-quality, large-scale dataset covering diverse telecom concepts, standards, and operational scenarios. Although T-Embed contains some proprietary material and cannot be fully released, we open source 75% of the dataset to support continued research in domain-specific representation learning. On a custom benchmark comprising 1500 query-passage pairs from IETF RFCs and vendor manuals, T-VEC surpasses MPNet, BGE, Jina and E5, demonstrating superior domain grounding and semantic precision in telecom-specific retrieval. Embedding visualizations further showcase tight clustering of telecom-relevant concepts. We release T-VEC and its tokenizer to support semantically faithful NLP applications within the telecom domain.

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a significant obstacle to the reliability and widespread adoption of language models, yet their accurate measurement remains a persistent challenge. While many task- and domain-specific metrics have been proposed to assess faithfulness and factuality concerns, the robustness and generalization of these metrics are still untested. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical evaluation of 6 diverse sets of hallucination detection metrics across 4 datasets, 37 language models from 5 families, and 5 decoding methods. Our extensive investigation reveals concerning gaps in current hallucination evaluation: metrics often fail to align with human judgments, take an overtly myopic view of the problem, and show inconsistent gains with parameter scaling. Encouragingly, LLM-based evaluation, particularly with GPT-4, yields the best overall results, and mode-seeking decoding methods seem to reduce hallucinations, especially in knowledge-grounded settings. These findings underscore the need for more robust metrics to understand and quantify hallucinations, and better strategies to mitigate them.

Abstract: To perform few-shot learning, language models extract signals from a few input-label pairs, aggregate these into a learned prediction rule, and apply this rule to new inputs. How is this implemented in the forward pass of modern transformer models? To explore this question, we study a structured family of few-shot learning tasks for which the true prediction rule is to add an integer $k$ to the input. We introduce a novel optimization method that localizes the model's few-shot ability to only a few attention heads. We then perform an in-depth analysis of individual heads, via dimensionality reduction and decomposition. As an example, on Llama-3-8B-instruct, we reduce its mechanism on our tasks to just three attention heads with six-dimensional subspaces, where four dimensions track the unit digit with trigonometric functions at periods $2$, $5$, and $10$, and two dimensions track magnitude with low-frequency components. To deepen our understanding of the mechanism, we also derive a mathematical identity relating ``aggregation'' and ``extraction'' subspaces for attention heads, allowing us to track the flow of information from individual examples to a final aggregated concept. Using this, we identify a self-correction mechanism where mistakes learned from earlier demonstrations are suppressed by later demonstrations. Our results demonstrate how tracking low-dimensional subspaces of localized heads across a forward pass can provide insight into fine-grained computational structures in language models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text embedding have significantly improved natural language understanding across many languages, yet Persian remains notably underrepresented in large-scale embedding research. In this paper, we present Hakim, a novel state-of-the-art Persian text embedding model that achieves a 8.5% performance improvement over existing approaches on the FaMTEB benchmark, outperforming all previously developed Persian language models. As part of this work, we introduce three new datasets - Corpesia, Pairsia-sup, and Pairsia-unsup - to support supervised and unsupervised training scenarios. Additionally, Hakim is designed for applications in chatbots and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, particularly addressing retrieval tasks that require incorporating message history within these systems. We also propose a new baseline model built on the BERT architecture. Our language model consistently achieves higher accuracy across various Persian NLP tasks, while the RetroMAE-based model proves particularly effective for textual information retrieval applications. Together, these contributions establish a new foundation for advancing Persian language understanding.

Existing preprocessing approaches generally lack transparent mechanisms for identifying which features or instances are responsible for unfairness. This obscures the rationale behind data modifications. We introduce FairSHAP, a novel pre-processing framework that leverages Shapley value attribution to improve both individual and group fairness. FairSHAP identifies fairness-critical instances in the training data using an interpretable measure of feature importance, and systematically modifies them through instance-level matching across sensitive groups. This process reduces discriminative risk - an individual fairness metric - while preserving data integrity and model accuracy. We demonstrate that FairSHAP significantly improves demographic parity and equality of opportunity across diverse tabular datasets, achieving fairness gains with minimal data perturbation and, in some cases, improved predictive performance. As a model-agnostic and transparent method, FairSHAP integrates seamlessly into existing machine learning pipelines and provides actionable insights into the sources of bias.Our code is on https://github.com/youlei202/FairSHAP.

<title>Logic Jailbreak: Efficiently Unlocking LLM Safety Restrictions Through Formal Logical Expression</title>

Abstract: Despite substantial advancements in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values, current safety mechanisms remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks. We hypothesize that this vulnerability stems from distributional discrepancies between alignment-oriented prompts and malicious prompts. To investigate this, we introduce LogiBreak, a novel and universal black-box jailbreak method that leverages logical expression translation to circumvent LLM safety systems. By converting harmful natural language prompts into formal logical expressions, LogiBreak exploits the distributional gap between alignment data and logic-based inputs, preserving the underlying semantic intent and readability while evading safety constraints. We evaluate LogiBreak on a multilingual jailbreak dataset spanning three languages, demonstrating its effectiveness across various evaluation settings and linguistic contexts.

<title>LLINBO: Trustworthy LLM-in-the-Loop Bayesian Optimization</title>

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a sequential decision-making tool widely used for optimizing expensive black-box functions. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable adaptability in low-data regimes, making them promising tools for black-box optimization by leveraging contextual knowledge to propose high-quality query points. However, relying solely on LLMs as optimization agents introduces risks due to their lack of explicit surrogate modeling and calibrated uncertainty, as well as their inherently opaque internal mechanisms. This structural opacity makes it difficult to characterize or control the exploration-exploitation trade-off, ultimately undermining theoretical tractability and reliability. To address this, we propose LLINBO: LLM-in-the-Loop BO, a hybrid framework for BO that combines LLMs with statistical surrogate experts (e.g., Gaussian Processes (GP)). The core philosophy is to leverage contextual reasoning strengths of LLMs for early exploration, while relying on principled statistical models to guide efficient exploitation. Specifically, we introduce three mechanisms that enable this collaboration and establish their theoretical guarantees. We end the paper with a real-life proof-of-concept in the context of 3D printing. The code to reproduce the results can be found at https://github.com/UMDataScienceLab/LLM-in-the-Loop-BO.

<title>Watch your steps: Dormant Adversarial Behaviors that Activate upon LLM Finetuning</title>

Abstract: Finetuning open-weight Large Language Models (LLMs) is standard practice for achieving task-specific performance improvements. Until now, finetuning has been regarded as a controlled and secure process in which training on benign datasets leads to predictable behaviors. In this paper, we demonstrate, for the first time, that an adversary can create compromised LLMs that are performant and benign, yet exhibit adversarial behaviors once finetuned by downstream users. To this end, we propose an attack, FAB (Finetuning-activated Adversarial Behaviors), which compromises an LLM via meta-learning techniques that simulate downstream finetuning, explicitly optimizing for the emergence of adversarial behaviors in the finetuned models. At the same time, the compromised LLM is regularized to retain general capabilities and to exhibit no adversarial behaviors prior to finetuning. As a result, when users finetune (e.g., instruction-tuning, distillation, DPO) the seemingly benign model on their own datasets, they unknowingly trigger its dormant adversarial behavior. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of FAB across multiple LLMs and three commonly considered target behaviors: unsolicited advertising, jailbreakability, and over-refusal. We show that FAB-triggers are robust to various finetuning choices made by the user (e.g., dataset, number of steps, scheduler, post-training algorithm). Our findings challenge prevailing assumptions on the security of finetuning, revealing a critical attack vector.

<title>Search Wisely: Mitigating Sub-optimal Agentic Searches By Reducing Uncertainty</title>

Abstract: Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling dynamic, multi-step reasoning and information retrieval. However, these systems often exhibit sub-optimal search behaviors like over-search (retrieving redundant information) and under-search (failing to retrieve necessary information), which hinder efficiency and reliability. This work formally defines and quantifies these behaviors, revealing their prevalence across multiple QA datasets and agentic RAG systems (e.g., one model could have avoided searching in 27.7% of its search steps). Furthermore, we demonstrate a crucial link between these inefficiencies and the models' uncertainty regarding their own knowledge boundaries, where response accuracy correlates with model's uncertainty in its search decisions. To address this, we propose $\beta$-GRPO, a reinforcement learning-based training method that incorporates confidence threshold to reward high-certainty search decisions. Experiments on seven QA benchmarks show that $\beta$-GRPO enable a 3B model with better agentic RAG ability, outperforming other strong baselines with a 4% higher average exact match score.

Abstract: A key research area in deepfake speech detection is source tracing - determining the origin of synthesised utterances. The approaches may involve identifying the acoustic model (AM), vocoder model (VM), or other generation-specific parameters. However, progress is limited by the lack of a dedicated, systematically curated dataset. To address this, we introduce STOPA, a systematically varied and metadata-rich dataset for deepfake speech source tracing, covering 8 AMs, 6 VMs, and diverse parameter settings across 700k samples from 13 distinct synthesisers. Unlike existing datasets, which often feature limited variation or sparse metadata, STOPA provides a systematically controlled framework covering a broader range of generative factors, such as the choice of the vocoder model, acoustic model, or pretrained weights, ensuring higher attribution reliability. This control improves attribution accuracy, aiding forensic analysis, deepfake detection, and generative model transparency.

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human feedback at inference time has received increasing attention due to its flexibility. Existing methods rely on generating multiple responses from the base policy for search using a reward model, which can be considered as searching in a discrete response space. However, these methods struggle to explore informative candidates when the base policy is weak or the candidate set is small, resulting in limited effectiveness. In this paper, to address this problem, we propose Simple Energy Adaptation ($\textbf{SEA}$), a simple yet effective algorithm for inference-time alignment. In contrast to expensive search over the discrete space, SEA directly adapts original responses from the base policy toward the optimal one via gradient-based sampling in continuous latent space. Specifically, SEA formulates inference as an iterative optimization procedure on an energy function over actions in the continuous space defined by the optimal policy, enabling simple and effective alignment. For instance, despite its simplicity, SEA outperforms the second-best baseline with a relative improvement of up to $ \textbf{77.51%}$ on AdvBench and $\textbf{16.36%}$ on MATH.

Abstract: Biomedical researchers increasingly rely on large-scale structured databases for complex analytical tasks. However, current text-to-SQL systems often struggle to map qualitative scientific questions into executable SQL, particularly when implicit domain reasoning is required. We introduce BiomedSQL, the first benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate scientific reasoning in text-to-SQL generation over a real-world biomedical knowledge base. BiomedSQL comprises 68,000 question/SQL query/answer triples generated from templates and grounded in a harmonized BigQuery knowledge base that integrates gene-disease associations, causal inference from omics data, and drug approval records. Each question requires models to infer domain-specific criteria, such as genome-wide significance thresholds, effect directionality, or trial phase filtering, rather than rely on syntactic translation alone. We evaluate a range of open- and closed-source LLMs across prompting strategies and interaction paradigms. Our results reveal a substantial performance gap: GPT-o3-mini achieves 59.0% execution accuracy, while our custom multi-step agent, BMSQL, reaches 62.6%, both well below the expert baseline of 90.0%. BiomedSQL provides a new foundation for advancing text-to-SQL systems capable of supporting scientific discovery through robust reasoning over structured biomedical knowledge bases. Our dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/NIH-CARD/BiomedSQL, and our code is open-source at https://github.com/NIH-CARD/biomedsql.

<title>The Shape of Adversarial Influence: Characterizing LLM Latent Spaces with Persistent Homology</title>

arXiv:2505.20435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing interpretability methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often fall short by focusing on linear directions or isolated features, overlooking the high-dimensional, nonlinear, and relational geometry within model representations. This study focuses on how adversarial inputs systematically affect the internal representation spaces of LLMs, a topic which remains poorly understood. We propose persistent homology (PH), a tool from topological data analysis, as a principled framework to characterize the multi-scale dynamics within LLM activations. Using PH, we systematically analyze six state-of-the-art models under two distinct adversarial conditions, indirect prompt injection and backdoor fine-tuning, and identify a consistent topological signature of adversarial influence. Across architectures and model sizes, adversarial inputs induce ``topological compression'', where the latent space becomes structurally simpler, collapsing from varied, compact, small-scale features into fewer, dominant, and more dispersed large-scale ones. This topological signature is statistically robust across layers, highly discriminative, and provides interpretable insights into how adversarial effects emerge and propagate. By quantifying the shape of activations and neuronal information flow, our architecture-agnostic framework reveals fundamental invariants of representational change, offering a complementary perspective to existing interpretability methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly evaluated on Standard American English (SAE), often overlooking the diversity of global English varieties. This narrow focus may raise fairness concerns as degraded performance on non-standard varieties can lead to unequal benefits for users worldwide. Therefore, it is critical to extensively evaluate the linguistic robustness of LLMs on multiple non-standard English varieties. We introduce Trans-EnV, a framework that automatically transforms SAE datasets into multiple English varieties to evaluate the linguistic robustness. Our framework combines (1) linguistics expert knowledge to curate variety-specific features and transformation guidelines from linguistic literature and corpora, and (2) LLM-based transformations to ensure both linguistic validity and scalability. Using Trans-EnV, we transform six benchmark datasets into 38 English varieties and evaluate seven state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results reveal significant performance disparities, with accuracy decreasing by up to 46.3% on non-standard varieties. These findings highlight the importance of comprehensive linguistic robustness evaluation across diverse English varieties. Each construction of Trans-EnV was validated through rigorous statistical testing and consultation with a researcher in the field of second language acquisition, ensuring its linguistic validity. Our code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/jiyounglee-0523/TransEnV and https://huggingface.co/collections/jiyounglee0523/transenv-681eadb3c0c8cf363b363fb1.

Abstract: Instance segmentation demands costly per-pixel annotations and computationally expensive models. We introduce CAST, a semi-supervised knowledge distillation (SSKD) framework that compresses pre-trained vision foundation models (VFM) into compact experts using limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. CAST unfolds in three stages: (1) domain adaptation of the VFM(s) via self-training with contrastive calibration, (2) knowledge transfer through a unified multi-objective loss, and (3) student refinement to mitigate residual pseudo-label bias. Central to CAST is an \emph{instance-aware pixel-wise contrastive loss} that fuses mask and class scores to extract informative negatives and enforce clear inter-instance margins. By maintaining this contrastive signal across both adaptation and distillation, we align teacher and student embeddings and fully leverage unlabeled images. On Cityscapes and ADE20K, our ~11x smaller student improves over its zero-shot VFM teacher(s) by +8.5 and +7.1 AP, surpasses adapted teacher(s) by +3.4 and +1.5 AP, and further outperforms state-of-the-art SSKD methods on both benchmarks.

Abstract: Document Image Enhancement (DIE) serves as a critical component in Document AI systems, where its performance substantially determines the effectiveness of downstream tasks. To address the limitations of existing methods confined to single-degradation restoration or grayscale image processing, we present Global with Local Parametric Generation Enhancement Network (GL-PGENet), a novel architecture designed for multi-degraded color document images, ensuring both efficiency and robustness in real-world scenarios. Our solution incorporates three key innovations: First, a hierarchical enhancement framework that integrates global appearance correction with local refinement, enabling coarse-to-fine quality improvement. Second, a Dual-Branch Local-Refine Network with parametric generation mechanisms that replaces conventional direct prediction, producing enhanced outputs through learned intermediate parametric representations rather than pixel-wise mapping. This approach enhances local consistency while improving model generalization. Finally, a modified NestUNet architecture incorporating dense block to effectively fuse low-level pixel features and high-level semantic features, specifically adapted for document image characteristics. In addition, to enhance generalization performance, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: large-scale pretraining on a synthetic dataset of 500,000+ samples followed by task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of GL-PGENet, achieving state-of-the-art SSIM scores of 0.7721 on DocUNet and 0.9480 on RealDAE. The model also exhibits remarkable cross-domain adaptability and maintains computational efficiency for high-resolution images without performance degradation, confirming its practical utility in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We tackle the task of any-reference video generation, which aims to synthesize videos conditioned on arbitrary types and combinations of reference subjects, together with textual prompts. This task faces persistent challenges, including identity inconsistency, entanglement among multiple reference subjects, and copy-paste artifacts. To address these issues, we introduce MAGREF, a unified and effective framework for any-reference video generation. Our approach incorporates masked guidance and a subject disentanglement mechanism, enabling flexible synthesis conditioned on diverse reference images and textual prompts. Specifically, masked guidance employs a region-aware masking mechanism combined with pixel-wise channel concatenation to preserve appearance features of multiple subjects along the channel dimension. This design preserves identity consistency and maintains the capabilities of the pre-trained backbone, without requiring any architectural changes. To mitigate subject confusion, we introduce a subject disentanglement mechanism which injects the semantic values of each subject derived from the text condition into its corresponding visual region. Additionally, we establish a four-stage data pipeline to construct diverse training pairs, effectively alleviating copy-paste artifacts. Extensive experiments on a comprehensive benchmark demonstrate that MAGREF consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, paving the way for scalable, controllable, and high-fidelity any-reference video synthesis.

arXiv:2506.01723v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Idioms present a unique challenge for language models due to their non-compositional figurative interpretations, which often strongly diverge from the idiom's literal interpretation. In this paper, we employ causal tracing to systematically analyze how pretrained causal transformers deal with this ambiguity. We localize three mechanisms: (i) Early sublayers and specific attention heads retrieve an idiom's figurative interpretation, while suppressing its literal interpretation. (ii) When disambiguating context precedes the idiom, the model leverages it from the earliest layer and later layers refine the interpretation if the context conflicts with the retrieved interpretation. (iii) Then, selective, competing pathways carry both interpretations: an intermediate pathway prioritizes the figurative interpretation and a parallel direct route favors the literal interpretation, ensuring that both readings remain available. Our findings provide mechanistic evidence for idiom comprehension in autoregressive transformers.

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a core capability for large language models (LLMs), yet existing benchmarks that rely solely on final-answer accuracy fail to capture the quality of the reasoning process. To address this, we introduce FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level probing. Leveraging this framework, we conduct a comprehensive study on how different supervision formats in fine-tuning shape reasoning abilities. We fine-tune LLMs on four supervision styles: one in natural language and three symbolic variants. We find a key trade-off: natural language supervision excels at generalization to out-of-distribution and long-chain problems, whereas symbolic supervision is superior at instilling structurally sound, atomic reasoning steps. Furthermore, our probing analysis indicates that fine-tuning primarily refines the model's step-by-step generation process, rather than improving its ability to converge on an answer early. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more rigorous lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning in LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/YujunZhou/FineLogic.

<title>Modality-Balancing Preference Optimization of Large Multimodal Models by Adversarial Negative Mining</title>

Abstract: The task adaptation and alignment of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have been significantly advanced by instruction tuning and further strengthened by recent preference optimization. Yet, most LMMs still suffer from severe modality imbalance during reasoning, i.e., outweighing language prior biases over visual inputs, which bottlenecks their generalization to downstream tasks and causes hallucinations. However, existing preference optimization approaches for LMMs do not focus on restraining the internal biases of their Large Language Model (LLM) backbones when curating the training data. Moreover, they heavily rely on offline data and lack the capacity to explore diverse responses adaptive to dynamic distributional shifts during training. Meanwhile, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent method using online-generated data and verified rewards to improve reasoning capabilities, remains largely underexplored in LMM alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel preference learning framework, Modality-Balancing Preference Optimization (MBPO), to address the modality imbalance in LMMs. MBPO constructs a more effective offline preference dataset by generating hard negatives, i.e., rejected responses misled by LLM biases due to limited usage of visual information, through adversarial perturbation of input images. Moreover, MBPO leverages the easy-to-verify nature of close-ended tasks to generate online responses with verified rewards. GRPO is then employed to train the model with offline-online hybrid data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MBPO can enhance LMM performance on challenging vision-language tasks and effectively reduce hallucinations.

Abstract: Modern neural models capture rich priors and have complementary knowledge over shared data domains, e.g., images and videos. Integrating diverse knowledge from multiple sources -- including visual generative models, visual language models, and sources with human-crafted knowledge such as graphics engines and physics simulators -- remains under-explored. We propose a Product of Experts (PoE) framework that performs inference-time knowledge composition from heterogeneous models. This training-free approach samples from the product distribution across experts via Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS). Our framework shows practical benefits in image and video synthesis tasks, yielding better controllability than monolithic methods and additionally providing flexible user interfaces for specifying visual generation goals.

Abstract: Large-scale pre-training has fundamentally changed how machine learning research is done today: large foundation models are trained once, and then can be used by anyone in the community (including those without data or compute resources to train a model from scratch) to adapt and fine-tune to specific tasks. Applying this same framework to reinforcement learning (RL) is appealing because it offers compelling avenues for addressing core challenges in RL, including sample efficiency and robustness. However, there remains a fundamental challenge to pre-train large models in the context of RL: actions have long-term dependencies, so training a foundation model that reasons across time is important. Recent advances in generative AI have provided new tools for modeling highly complex distributions. In this paper, we build a probabilistic model to predict which states an agent will visit in the temporally distant future (i.e., an occupancy measure) using flow matching. As large datasets are often constructed by many distinct users performing distinct tasks, we include in our model a latent variable capturing the user intention. This intention increases the expressivity of our model, and enables adaptation with generalized policy improvement. We call our proposed method intention-conditioned flow occupancy models (InFOM). Comparing with alternative methods for pre-training, our experiments on $36$ state-based and $4$ image-based benchmark tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves $1.8 \times$ median improvement in returns and increases success rates by $36\%$.

Abstract: Reasoning-based large language models have excelled in mathematics and programming, yet their potential in knowledge-intensive medical question answering remains underexplored and insufficiently validated in clinical contexts. To bridge this gap, we introduce ReasonMed, the largest medical reasoning dataset to date, comprising 370k high-quality examples distilled from 1.75 million initial reasoning paths generated by complementary LLMs and curated through a cost-efficient easy-medium-difficult (EMD) pipeline. ReasonMed is built through a multi-agent generation, verification, and refinement process, in which an Error Refiner improves reasoning paths by correcting error-prone steps identified by a verifier. Using ReasonMed, we investigate effective strategies for training medical reasoning models and find that integrating detailed CoT reasoning with concise answer summaries yields the most robust fine-tuning results. Models trained on ReasonMed set a new benchmark: ReasonMed-7B surpasses the prior best sub-10B models by 4.17% and even exceeds LLaMA3.1-70B on PubMedQA by 4.60%. When scaled to ReasonMed-14B, it remains highly competitive, underscoring consistent scaling potential. The codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/YuSun-Work/ReasonMed.

Abstract: Long-video understanding~(LVU) is a challenging problem in computer vision. Existing methods either downsample frames for single-pass reasoning, sacrificing fine-grained details, or depend on textual reasoning over task-agnostic representations, hindering task-specific perception and exploration. In this paper, we propose VideoExplorer, a framework grounded in the principle of ``thinking with video'', which naturally intertwines planning, temporal grounding, and scalable perception into a coherent reasoning process. Rather than reasoning over a static context, VideoExplorer iteratively formulates sub-questions, locates relevant moments, and performs task-oriented, temporally scalable video understanding until reaching the final answer, enabling faithful, efficient, and interpretable reasoning. To address the lack of LVU training resources, we construct a long-video reasoning dataset using difficulty-adaptive sampling to ensure high-quality trajectories on complex tasks. Building on this dataset, we design a two-stage training pipeline: supervised trajectory initialization followed by trajectory-level preference optimization, encouraging adaptive temporal grounding and iterative information integration guided by downstream rewards. Extensive evaluations on popular long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate VideoExplorer's significant advantage over existing baselines, highlighting its robustness, adaptability, and efficiency. Our code is made publicly available in this repository(https://github.com/yhy-2000/VideoDeepResearch).

Abstract: Diffusion bridges are a promising class of deep-learning methods for sampling from unnormalized distributions. Recent works show that the Log Variance (LV) loss consistently outperforms the reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) loss when using the reparametrization trick to compute rKL-gradients. While the on-policy LV loss yields identical gradients to the rKL loss when combined with the log-derivative trick for diffusion samplers with non-learnable forward processes, this equivalence does not hold for diffusion bridges or when diffusion coefficients are learned. Based on this insight we argue that for diffusion bridges the LV loss does not represent an optimization objective that can be motivated like the rKL loss via the data processing inequality. Our analysis shows that employing the rKL loss with the log-derivative trick (rKL-LD) does not only avoid these conceptual problems but also consistently outperforms the LV loss. Experimental results with different types of diffusion bridges on challenging benchmarks show that samplers trained with the rKL-LD loss achieve better performance. From a practical perspective we find that rKL-LD requires significantly less hyperparameter optimization and yields more stable training behavior.

Abstract: As AI becomes more personal, e.g., Agentic AI, there is an increasing need for personalizing models for various use cases. Personalized federated learning (PFL) enables each client to collaboratively leverage other clients' knowledge for better adaptation to the task of interest, without privacy risks. Despite its potential, existing PFL methods remain confined to rather simplified scenarios where data and models are the same across clients. To move towards realistic scenarios, we propose FedMosaic, a method that jointly addresses data and model heterogeneity with a task-relevance-aware model aggregation strategy to reduce parameter interference, and a dimension-invariant module that enables knowledge sharing across heterogeneous architectures without huge computational cost. To mimic the real-world task diversity, we propose a multi-modal PFL benchmark spanning 40 distinct tasks with distribution shifts over time. The empirical study shows that FedMosaic outperforms the state-of-the-art PFL methods, excelling in both personalization and generalization capabilities under challenging, realistic scenarios.

Abstract: Peer review is essential for maintaining academic quality, but the increasing volume of submissions places a significant burden on reviewers. Large language models (LLMs) offer potential assistance in this process, yet their susceptibility to textual adversarial attacks raises reliability concerns. This paper investigates the robustness of LLMs used as automated reviewers in the presence of such attacks. We focus on three key questions: (1) The effectiveness of LLMs in generating reviews compared to human reviewers. (2) The impact of adversarial attacks on the reliability of LLM-generated reviews. (3) Challenges and potential mitigation strategies for LLM-based review. Our evaluation reveals significant vulnerabilities, as text manipulations can distort LLM assessments. We offer a comprehensive evaluation of LLM performance in automated peer reviewing and analyze its robustness against adversarial attacks. Our findings emphasize the importance of addressing adversarial risks to ensure AI strengthens, rather than compromises, the integrity of scholarly communication.

Abstract: Foundation models have gained growing interest in the IoT domain due to their reduced reliance on labeled data and strong generalizability across tasks, which address key limitations of traditional machine learning approaches. However, most existing foundation model based methods are developed for specific IoT tasks, making it difficult to compare approaches across IoT domains and limiting guidance for applying them to new tasks. This survey aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive overview of current methodologies and organizing them around four shared performance objectives by different domains: efficiency, context-awareness, safety, and security & privacy. For each objective, we review representative works, summarize commonly-used techniques and evaluation metrics. This objective-centric organization enables meaningful cross-domain comparisons and offers practical insights for selecting and designing foundation model based solutions for new IoT tasks. We conclude with key directions for future research to guide both practitioners and researchers in advancing the use of foundation models in IoT applications.

<title>The Role of Model Confidence on Bias Effects in Measured Uncertainties for Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: With the growing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) for open-ended tasks, accurately assessing epistemic uncertainty, which reflects a model's lack of knowledge, has become crucial to ensuring reliable outcomes. However, quantifying epistemic uncertainty in such tasks is challenging due to the presence of aleatoric uncertainty, which arises from multiple valid answers. While bias can introduce noise into epistemic uncertainty estimation, it may also reduce noise from aleatoric uncertainty. To investigate this trade-off, we conduct experiments on Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks and find that mitigating prompt-introduced bias improves uncertainty quantification in GPT-4o. Building on prior work showing that LLMs tend to copy input information when model confidence is low, we further analyze how these prompt biases affect measured epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty across varying bias-free confidence levels with GPT-4o and Qwen2-VL. We find that all considered biases have greater effects in both uncertainties when bias-free model confidence is lower. Moreover, lower bias-free model confidence is associated with greater bias-induced underestimation of epistemic uncertainty, resulting in overconfident estimates, whereas it has no significant effect on the direction of bias effect in aleatoric uncertainty estimation. These distinct effects deepen our understanding of bias mitigation for uncertainty quantification and potentially inform the development of more advanced techniques.

Abstract: Running Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is constrained by high compute and memory demands posing a barrier for real-time applications in sectors like healthcare, education, and embedded systems. Current solutions such as quantization, pruning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offer only partial optimizations and often compromise on speed or accuracy. We introduce HOLA, an end-to-end optimization framework for efficient LLM deployment. Internally, it leverages Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD) for faster inference without quality loss. Externally, AdaComp-RAG adjusts retrieval complexity based on context needs. Together with LoBi, which blends structured pruning (LoRA) and quantization, HOLA delivers significant gains: 17.6% EMA on GSM8K, 10.5% MCA on ARC, and reduced latency and memory on edge devices like Jetson Nano--proving both scalable and production-ready.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for transforming digital health by enabling automated medical question answering. However, ensuring these models meet critical industry standards for factual accuracy, usefulness, and safety remains a challenge, especially for open-source solutions. We present a rigorous benchmarking framework using a dataset of over 1,000 health questions. We assess model performance across honesty, helpfulness, and harmlessness. Our results highlight trade-offs between factual reliability and safety among evaluated models -- Mistral-7B, BioMistral-7B-DARE, and AlpaCare-13B. AlpaCare-13B achieves the highest accuracy (91.7%) and harmlessness (0.92), while domain-specific tuning in BioMistral-7B-DARE boosts safety (0.90) despite its smaller scale. Few-shot prompting improves accuracy from 78% to 85%, and all models show reduced helpfulness on complex queries, highlighting ongoing challenges in clinical QA.

<title>Efficiency-Effectiveness Reranking FLOPs for LLM-based Rerankers</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06223</link>

arXiv:2507.06223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been applied to reranking tasks in information retrieval, achieving strong performance. However, their high computational demands often hinder practical deployment. Existing studies evaluate the efficiency of LLM-based rerankers using proxy metrics such as latency, the number of forward passes, input tokens, and output tokens. However, these metrics depend on hardware and running-time choices (\eg parallel or not, batch size, etc), and often fail to account for model size, making it difficult to interpret and obscuring the evaluation of the efficiency-effectiveness tradeoff. To address this issue, we propose \ours\footnote{https://github.com/zhiyuanpeng/EER-FLOPs.} for LLM-based rerankers: RPP (ranking metrics per PetaFLOP), measuring how much ranking quality (e.g., NDCG or MRR) a method achieves per PetaFLOP, and QPP (queries per PetaFLOP), measuring how many queries can be processed per PetaFLOP. Accompanied by the new metrics, an interpretable FLOPs estimator is developed to estimate the FLOPs of an LLM-based reranker even without running any experiments. Based on the proposed metrics, we conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate a wide range of LLM-based rerankers with different architectures, studying the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off and bringing this issue to the attention of the research community.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into conversational robots has made human-robot conversations more dynamic. Yet, LLM-powered conversational robots remain prone to errors, e.g., misunderstanding user intent, prematurely interrupting users, or failing to respond altogether. Detecting and addressing these failures is critical for preventing conversational breakdowns, avoiding task disruptions, and sustaining user trust. To tackle this problem, the ERR@HRI 2.0 Challenge provides a multimodal dataset of LLM-powered conversational robot failures during human-robot conversations and encourages researchers to benchmark machine learning models designed to detect robot failures. The dataset includes 16 hours of dyadic human-robot interactions, incorporating facial, speech, and head movement features. Each interaction is annotated with the presence or absence of robot errors from the system perspective, and perceived user intention to correct for a mismatch between robot behavior and user expectation. Participants are invited to form teams and develop machine learning models that detect these failures using multimodal data. Submissions will be evaluated using various performance metrics, including detection accuracy and false positive rate. This challenge represents another key step toward improving failure detection in human-robot interaction through social signal analysis.

Abstract: AI companion chatbots are increasingly popular with teens, while these interactions are entertaining, they also risk overuse that can potentially disrupt offline daily life. We examined how adolescents describe reliance on AI companions, mapping their experiences onto behavioral addiction frameworks and exploring pathways to disengagement, by analyzing 318 Reddit posts made by users who self-disclosed as 13-17 years old on the Character.AI subreddit. We found teens often begin using chatbots for support or creative play, but these activities can deepen into strong attachments marked by conflict, withdrawal, tolerance, relapse, and mood regulation. Reported consequences include sleep loss, academic decline, and strained real-world connections. Disengagement commonly arises when teens recognize harm, re-engage with offline life, or encounter restrictive platform changes. We highlight specific risks of character-based companion chatbots based on teens' perspectives and introduce a design framework (CARE) for guidance for safer systems and setting directions for future teen-centered research.

<title>Leveraging Personalized PageRank and Higher-Order Topological Structures for Heterophily Mitigation in Graph Neural Networks</title>

arXiv:2507.16347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in node classification tasks but often assume homophily, where connected nodes share similar labels. This assumption does not hold in many real-world heterophilic graphs. Existing models for heterophilic graphs primarily rely on pairwise relationships, overlooking multi-scale information from higher-order structures. This leads to suboptimal performance, particularly under noise from conflicting class information across nodes. To address these challenges, we propose HPGNN, a novel model integrating Higher-order Personalized PageRank with Graph Neural Networks. HPGNN introduces an efficient high-order approximation of Personalized PageRank (PPR) to capture long-range and multi-scale node interactions. This approach reduces computational complexity and mitigates noise from surrounding information. By embedding higher-order structural information into convolutional networks, HPGNN effectively models key interactions across diverse graph dimensions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate HPGNN's effectiveness. The model achieves better performance than five out of seven state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs in downstream tasks while maintaining competitive performance on homophilic graphs. HPGNN's ability to balance multi-scale information and robustness to noise makes it a versatile solution for real-world graph learning challenges. Codes are available at https://github.com/streetcorner/HPGNN.

<title>Controllable Hybrid Captioner for Improved Long-form Video Understanding</title>

Abstract: Video data, especially long-form video, is extremely dense and high-dimensional. Text-based summaries of video content offer a way to represent query-relevant content in a much more compact manner than raw video. In addition, textual representations are easily ingested by state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), which enable reasoning over video content to answer complex natural language queries. To solve this issue, we rely on the progressive construction of a text-based memory by a video captioner operating on shorter chunks of the video, where spatio-temporal modeling is computationally feasible. We explore ways to improve the quality of the activity log comprised solely of short video captions. Because the video captions tend to be focused on human actions, and questions may pertain to other information in the scene, we seek to enrich the memory with static scene descriptions using Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our video understanding system relies on the LaViLa video captioner in combination with a LLM to answer questions about videos. We first explored different ways of partitioning the video into meaningful segments such that the textual descriptions more accurately reflect the structure of the video content. Furthermore, we incorporated static scene descriptions into the captioning pipeline using LLaVA VLM, resulting in a more detailed and complete caption log and expanding the space of questions that are answerable from the textual memory. Finally, we have successfully fine-tuned the LaViLa video captioner to produce both action and scene captions, significantly improving the efficiency of the captioning pipeline compared to using separate captioning models for the two tasks. Our model, controllable hybrid captioner, can alternate between different types of captions according to special input tokens that signals scene changes detected in the video.

Abstract: AI-generated clinical notes are increasingly used in healthcare, but evaluating their quality remains a challenge due to high subjectivity and limited scalability of expert review. Existing automated metrics often fail to align with real-world physician preferences. To address this, we propose a pipeline that systematically distills real user feedback into structured checklists for note evaluation. These checklists are designed to be interpretable, grounded in human feedback, and enforceable by LLM-based evaluators. Using deidentified data from over 21,000 clinical encounters (prepared in accordance with the HIPAA safe harbor standard) from a deployed AI medical scribe system, we show that our feedback-derived checklist outperforms a baseline approach in our offline evaluations in coverage, diversity, and predictive power for human ratings. Extensive experiments confirm the checklist's robustness to quality-degrading perturbations, significant alignment with clinician preferences, and practical value as an evaluation methodology. In offline research settings, our checklist offers a practical tool for flagging notes that may fall short of our defined quality standards.

<title>Distilling a Small Utility-Based Passage Selector to Enhance Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating retrieved information. Standard retrieval process prioritized relevance, focusing on topical alignment between queries and passages. In contrast, in RAG, the emphasis has shifted to utility, which considers the usefulness of passages for generating accurate answers. Despite empirical evidence showing the benefits of utility-based retrieval in RAG, the high computational cost of using LLMs for utility judgments limits the number of passages evaluated. This restriction is problematic for complex queries requiring extensive information. To address this, we propose a method to distill the utility judgment capabilities of LLMs into smaller, more efficient models. Our approach focuses on utility-based selection rather than ranking, enabling dynamic passage selection tailored to specific queries without the need for fixed thresholds. We train student models to learn pseudo-answer generation and utility judgments from teacher LLMs, using a sliding window method that dynamically selects useful passages. Our experiments demonstrate that utility-based selection provides a flexible and cost-effective solution for RAG, significantly reducing computational costs while improving answer quality. We present the distillation results using Qwen3-32B as the teacher model for both relevance ranking and utility-based selection, distilled into RankQwen1.7B and UtilityQwen1.7B. Our findings indicate that for complex questions, utility-based selection is more effective than relevance ranking in enhancing answer generation performance. We will release the relevance ranking and utility-based selection annotations for the MS MARCO dataset, supporting further research in this area.

Abstract: Style-conditioned data poisoning is identified as a covert vector for amplifying sociolinguistic bias in large language models. Using small poisoned budgets that pair dialectal prompts -- principally African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and a Southern dialect -- with toxic or stereotyped completions during instruction tuning, this work probes whether linguistic style can act as a latent trigger for harmful behavior. Across multiple model families and scales, poisoned exposure elevates toxicity and stereotype expression for dialectal inputs -- most consistently for AAVE -- while Standard American English remains comparatively lower yet not immune. A multi-metric audit combining classifier-based toxicity with an LLM-as-a-judge reveals stereotype-laden content even when lexical toxicity appears muted, indicating that conventional detectors under-estimate sociolinguistic harms. Additionally, poisoned models exhibit emergent jailbreaking despite the absence of explicit slurs in the poison, suggesting weakened alignment rather than memorization. These findings underscore the need for dialect-aware evaluation, content-level stereotype auditing, and training protocols that explicitly decouple style from toxicity to prevent bias amplification through seemingly minor, style-based contamination.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs), especially for knowledge-intensive tasks. Despite its advantages, current RAG methods often struggle to fully exploit knowledge during generation. In particular, the synergy between the model's internal parametric knowledge and external retrieved knowledge remains limited. Retrieved contents may sometimes mislead generation, while certain generated content can guide the model toward more accurate outputs. In this work, we propose Collaborative Chain-of-Agents, a framework designed to enhance explicitly synergy over both parametric and retrieved knowledge. Specifically, we first introduce CoCoA-zero, a multi-agent RAG framework that first performs conditional knowledge induction and then reasons answers. Building on this, we develop CoCoA, a long-chain training strategy that synthesizes extended multi-agent reasoning trajectories from CoCoA-zero to fine-tune the LLM. This strategy enhances the model's capability to explicitly integrate and jointly leverage parametric and retrieved knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of CoCoA in open-domain QA and multi-hop QA.

Abstract: Despite recent advances, long-sequence video generation frameworks still suffer from significant limitations: poor assistive capability, suboptimal visual quality, and limited expressiveness. To mitigate these limitations, we propose MAViS, a multi-agent collaborative framework designed to assist in long-sequence video storytelling by efficiently translating ideas into visual narratives. MAViS orchestrates specialized agents across multiple stages, including script writing, shot designing, character modeling, keyframe generation, video animation, and audio generation. In each stage, agents operate under the 3E Principle--Explore, Examine, and Enhanc--to ensure the completeness of intermediate outputs. Considering the capability limitations of current generative models, we propose the Script Writing Guidelines to optimize compatibility between scripts and generative tools. Experimental results demonstrate that MAViS achieves state-of-the-art performance in assistive capability, visual quality, and video expressiveness. Its modular framework further enables scalability with diverse generative models and tools. With just a brief idea description, MAViS enables users to rapidly explore diverse visual storytelling and creative directions for sequential video generation by efficiently producing high-quality, complete long-sequence videos. To the best of our knowledge, MAViS is the only framework that provides multimodal design output -- videos with narratives and background music.

Abstract: We present MInDI-3D (Medical Inversion by Direct Iteration in 3D), the first 3D conditional diffusion-based model for real-world sparse-view Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) artefact removal, aiming to reduce imaging radiation exposure. A key contribution is extending the "InDI" concept from 2D to a full 3D volumetric approach for medical images, implementing an iterative denoising process that refines the CBCT volume directly from sparse-view input. A further contribution is the generation of a large pseudo-CBCT dataset (16,182) from chest CT volumes of the CT-RATE public dataset to robustly train MInDI-3D. We performed a comprehensive evaluation, including quantitative metrics, scalability analysis, generalisation tests, and a clinical assessment by 11 clinicians. Our results show MInDI-3D's effectiveness, achieving a 12.96 (6.10) dB PSNR gain over uncorrected scans with only 50 projections on the CT-RATE pseudo-CBCT (independent real-world) test set and enabling an 8x reduction in imaging radiation exposure. We demonstrate its scalability by showing that performance improves with more training data. Importantly, MInDI-3D matches the performance of a 3D U-Net on real-world scans from 16 cancer patients across distortion and task-based metrics. It also generalises to new CBCT scanner geometries. Clinicians rated our model as sufficient for patient positioning across all anatomical sites and found it preserved lung tumour boundaries well.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into real-world applications via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a universal, open standard for connecting AI agents with data sources and external tools. While MCP enhances the capabilities of LLM-based agents, it also introduces new security risks and expands their attack surfaces. In this paper, we present the first systematic taxonomy of MCP security, identifying 17 attack types across 4 primary attack surfaces. We introduce MCPSecBench, a comprehensive security benchmark and playground that integrates prompt datasets, MCP servers, MCP clients, attack scripts, and protection mechanisms to evaluate these attacks across three major MCP providers. Our benchmark is modular and extensible, allowing researchers to incorporate custom implementations of clients, servers, and transport protocols for systematic security assessment. Experimental results show that over 85% of the identified attacks successfully compromise at least one platform, with core vulnerabilities universally affecting Claude, OpenAI, and Cursor, while prompt-based and tool-centric attacks exhibit considerable variability across different hosts and models. In addition, current protection mechanisms have little effect against these attacks. Overall, MCPSecBench standardizes the evaluation of MCP security and enables rigorous testing across all MCP layers.

<title>MAHL: Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Hierarchical Chiplet Design with Adaptive Debugging</title>

Abstract: As program workloads (e.g., AI) increase in size and algorithmic complexity, the primary challenge lies in their high dimensionality, encompassing computing cores, array sizes, and memory hierarchies. To overcome these obstacles, innovative approaches are required. Agile chip design has already benefited from machine learning integration at various stages, including logic synthesis, placement, and routing. With Large Language Models (LLMs) recently demonstrating impressive proficiency in Hardware Description Language (HDL) generation, it is promising to extend their abilities to 2.5D integration, an advanced technique that saves area overhead and development costs. However, LLM-driven chiplet design faces challenges such as flatten design, high validation cost and imprecise parameter optimization, which limit its chiplet design capability. To address this, we propose MAHL, a hierarchical LLM-based chiplet design generation framework that features six agents which collaboratively enable AI algorithm-hardware mapping, including hierarchical description generation, retrieval-augmented code generation, diverseflow-based validation, and multi-granularity design space exploration. These components together enhance the efficient generation of chiplet design with optimized Power, Performance and Area (PPA). Experiments show that MAHL not only significantly improves the generation accuracy of simple RTL design, but also increases the generation accuracy of real-world chiplet design, evaluated by Pass@5, from 0 to 0.72 compared to conventional LLMs under the best-case scenario. Compared to state-of-the-art CLARIE (expert-based), MAHL achieves comparable or even superior PPA results under certain optimization objectives.

Abstract: While large reasoning models have shown remarkable ability to generate long chains-of-thought (CoTs) in English, we still lack understanding of how these long-form reasoning abilities transfer to the vast majority of the world's languages. In this work, we systematically investigate four key stages of model development--scaling, pretraining, post-training, and inference--to understand how long CoT capabilities extend beyond English. We compare two reasoning settings across nine non-English target languages: En-CoT, where models process target-language inputs, but reason in English; and Target-CoT, where models both process inputs and generate long CoTs in the target language. We find that scaling reasoning model size improves multilingual task performance in En-CoT, but Target-CoT performance lags behind. This gap widens for tasks requiring long, multi-step CoTs such as mathematical reasoning. Shifting to pretraining, we find that adding a specialized reasoning stage enhances En-CoT performance but degrades Target-CoT, whereas broad multilingual pretraining improves both modes simultaneously. Given the scarcity of high-quality reasoning traces in languages other than English, we explore synthetic data curation approaches for post-training. We demonstrate that fine-tuning on reasoning traces automatically translated from gold English traces outperforms fine-tuning on target-language traces distilled from large reasoning models. Finally, we report disparities in inference efficiency between languages and uncover language-specific failure modes in CoTs. We release models, datasets, and code to foster further research.

arXiv:2508.17364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The image-to-image generation task aims to produce controllable images by leveraging conditional inputs and prompt instructions. However, existing methods often train separate control branches for each type of condition, leading to redundant model structures and inefficient use of computational resources. To address this, we propose a Unified image-to-image Generation (UniGen) framework that supports diverse conditional inputs while enhancing generation efficiency and expressiveness. Specifically, to tackle the widely existing parameter redundancy and computational inefficiency in controllable conditional generation architectures, we propose the Condition Modulated Expert (CoMoE) module. This module aggregates semantically similar patch features and assigns them to dedicated expert modules for visual representation and conditional modeling. By enabling independent modeling of foreground features under different conditions, CoMoE effectively mitigates feature entanglement and redundant computation in multi-condition scenarios. Furthermore, to bridge the information gap between the backbone and control branches, we propose WeaveNet, a dynamic, snake-like connection mechanism that enables effective interaction between global text-level control from the backbone and fine-grained control from conditional branches. Extensive experiments on the Subjects-200K and MultiGen-20M datasets across various conditional image generation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its advantages in both versatility and effectiveness. The code has been uploaded to https://github.com/gavin-gqzhang/UniGen.

<title>Safe-Control: A Safety Patch for Mitigating Unsafe Content in Text-to-Image Generation Models</title>

arXiv:2508.21099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their potential for misuse or even abuse raises serious safety concerns. Model developers have made tremendous efforts to introduce safety mechanisms that can address these concerns in T2I models. However, the existing safety mechanisms, whether external or internal, either remain susceptible to evasion under distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments. To address these limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models. Using data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects safety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a patch-like manner. Model developers can also construct various safety patches to meet the evolving safety requirements, which can be flexibly merged into a single, unified patch. Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability, making it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoising architecture. We conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models. Empirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe content generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generative architectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of benign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including both external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all baselines in reducing unsafe content generation. For example, it reduces the probability of unsafe content generation to 7%, compared to approximately 20% for most baseline methods, under both unsafe prompts and the latest adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Large Language Models (LLM) fundamentally rely on high-quality training data. While data selection and data synthesis are two common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns (complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores (quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our Middo consistently enhances the quality of seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Word2VecT/Middo.

Abstract: Prompt injection attacks pose a significant challenge to the safe deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications. While prompt-based detection offers a lightweight and interpretable defense strategy, its effectiveness has been hindered by the need for manual prompt engineering. To address this issue, we propose AEGIS , an Automated co-Evolutionary framework for Guarding prompt Injections Schema. Both attack and defense prompts are iteratively optimized against each other using a gradient-like natural language prompt optimization technique. This framework enables both attackers and defenders to autonomously evolve via a Textual Gradient Optimization (TGO) module, leveraging feedback from an LLM-guided evaluation loop. We evaluate our system on a real-world assignment grading dataset of prompt injection attacks and demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving superior robustness in both attack success and detection. Specifically, the attack success rate (ASR) reaches 1.0, representing an improvement of 0.26 over the baseline. For detection, the true positive rate (TPR) improves by 0.23 compared to the previous best work, reaching 0.84, and the true negative rate (TNR) remains comparable at 0.89. Ablation studies confirm the importance of co-evolution, gradient buffering, and multi-objective optimization. We also confirm that this framework is effective in different LLMs. Our results highlight the promise of adversarial training as a scalable and effective approach for guarding prompt injections.

Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and a major driver of climate change, making its timely detection critical for effective mitigation. Machine learning (ML) deployed onboard satellites can enable rapid detection while reducing downlink costs, supporting faster response systems. Conventional methane detection methods often rely on image processing techniques, such as orthorectification to correct geometric distortions and matched filters to enhance plume signals. We introduce a novel approach that bypasses these preprocessing steps by using \textit{unorthorectified} data (UnorthoDOS). We find that ML models trained on this dataset achieve performance comparable to those trained on orthorectified data. Moreover, we also train models on an orthorectified dataset, showing that they can outperform the matched filter baseline (mag1c). We release model checkpoints and two ML-ready datasets comprising orthorectified and unorthorectified hyperspectral images from the Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) sensor at https://huggingface.co/datasets/SpaceML/UnorthoDOS , along with code at https://github.com/spaceml-org/plume-hunter.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show best-in-class performance across a wide range of natural language processing applications. Training these models is an extremely computationally expensive task; frontier Artificial Intelligence (AI) research companies are investing billions of dollars into supercomputing infrastructure to train progressively larger models on increasingly massive datasets. Unfortunately, very little information about the scaling performance and training considerations of these large training pipelines is released publicly. Working with very large datasets and models can be complex and practical recommendations are scarce in the public literature for tuning training performance when scaling up large language models. In this paper, we aim to demystify the large language model pretraining pipeline somewhat - in particular with respect to distributed training, managing large datasets across hundreds of nodes, and scaling up data parallelism with an emphasis on fully leveraging available GPU compute capacity.

<title>Barycentric Neural Networks and Length-Weighted Persistent Entropy Loss: A Green Geometric and Topological Framework for Function Approximation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.06694v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While artificial neural networks are known as universal approximators for continuous functions, many modern approaches rely on overparameterized architectures with high computational cost. In this work, we introduce the Barycentric Neural Network (BNN): a compact shallow architecture that encodes both structure and parameters through a fixed set of base points and their associated barycentric coordinates. We show that the BNN enables the exact representation of continuous piecewise linear functions (CPLFs), ensuring strict continuity across segments. Given that any continuous function on a compact domain can be uniformly approximated by CPLFs, the BNN emerges as a flexible and interpretable tool for function approximation.
  To enhance geometric fidelity in low-resource scenarios, such as those with few base points to create BNNs or limited training epochs, we propose length-weighted persistent entropy (LWPE): a stable variant of persistent entropy. Our approach integrates the BNN with a loss function based on LWPE to optimize the base points that define the BNN, rather than its internal parameters. Experimental results show that our approach achieves superior and faster approximation performance compared to standard losses (MSE, RMSE, MAE and LogCosh), offering a computationally sustainable alternative for function approximation.

Abstract: Multi-turn-to-single-turn (M2S) compresses iterative red-teaming into one structured prompt, but prior work relied on a handful of manually written templates. We present X-Teaming Evolutionary M2S, an automated framework that discovers and optimizes M2S templates through language-model-guided evolution. The system pairs smart sampling from 12 sources with an LLM-as-judge inspired by StrongREJECT and records fully auditable logs.
  Maintaining selection pressure by setting the success threshold to $\theta = 0.70$, we obtain five evolutionary generations, two new template families, and 44.8% overall success (103/230) on GPT-4.1. A balanced cross-model panel of 2,500 trials (judge fixed) shows that structural gains transfer but vary by target; two models score zero at the same threshold. We also find a positive coupling between prompt length and score, motivating length-aware judging.
  Our results demonstrate that structure-level search is a reproducible route to stronger single-turn probes and underscore the importance of threshold calibration and cross-model evaluation. Code, configurations, and artifacts are available at https://github.com/hyunjun1121/M2S-x-teaming.

Abstract: In this paper, we survey recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs). RL has achieved remarkable success in advancing the frontier of LLM capabilities, particularly in addressing complex logical tasks such as mathematics and coding. As a result, RL has emerged as a foundational methodology for transforming LLMs into LRMs. With the rapid progress of the field, further scaling of RL for LRMs now faces foundational challenges not only in computational resources but also in algorithm design, training data, and infrastructure. To this end, it is timely to revisit the development of this domain, reassess its trajectory, and explore strategies to enhance the scalability of RL toward Artificial SuperIntelligence (ASI). In particular, we examine research applying RL to LLMs and LRMs for reasoning abilities, especially since the release of DeepSeek-R1, including foundational components, core problems, training resources, and downstream applications, to identify future opportunities and directions for this rapidly evolving area. We hope this review will promote future research on RL for broader reasoning models. Github: https://github.com/TsinghuaC3I/Awesome-RL-for-LRMs

Abstract: We present TalkPlayData 2, a synthetic dataset for multimodal conversational music recommendation generated by an agentic data pipeline. In the proposed pipeline, multiple large language model (LLM) agents are created under various roles with specialized prompts and access to different parts of information, and the chat data is acquired by logging the conversation between the Listener LLM and the Recsys LLM. To cover various conversation scenarios, for each conversation, the Listener LLM is conditioned on a finetuned conversation goal. Finally, all the LLMs are multimodal with audio and images, allowing a simulation of multimodal recommendation and conversation. In the LLM-as-a-judge and subjective evaluation experiments, TalkPlayData 2 achieved the proposed goal in various aspects related to training a generative recommendation model for music. TalkPlayData 2 and its generation code are released at https://talkpl.ai/talkplaydata2.

Abstract: Medical image classification requires not only high predictive performance but also interpretability to ensure clinical trust and adoption. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful framework for modeling relational structures within datasets; however, standard GNNs often operate as black boxes, limiting transparency and usability, particularly in clinical settings. In this work, we present an interpretable graph-based learning framework named FireGNN that integrates trainable fuzzy rules into GNNs for medical image classification. These rules embed topological descriptors - node degree, clustering coefficient, and label agreement - using learnable thresholds and sharpness parameters to enable intrinsic symbolic reasoning. Additionally, we explore auxiliary self-supervised tasks (e.g., homophily prediction, similarity entropy) as a benchmark to evaluate the contribution of topological learning. Our fuzzy-rule-enhanced model achieves strong performance across five MedMNIST benchmarks and the synthetic dataset MorphoMNIST, while also generating interpretable rule-based explanations. To our knowledge, this is the first integration of trainable fuzzy rules within a GNN. Source Code: https://github.com/basiralab/FireGNN

arXiv:2509.11552v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the response capabilities of language models by integrating external knowledge sources. However, document chunking as an important part of RAG system often lacks effective evaluation tools. This paper first analyzes why existing RAG evaluation benchmarks are inadequate for assessing document chunking quality, specifically due to evidence sparsity. Based on this conclusion, we propose HiCBench, which includes manually annotated multi-level document chunking points, synthesized evidence-dense quetion answer(QA) pairs, and their corresponding evidence sources. Additionally, we introduce the HiChunk framework, a multi-level document structuring framework based on fine-tuned LLMs, combined with the Auto-Merge retrieval algorithm to improve retrieval quality. Experiments demonstrate that HiCBench effectively evaluates the impact of different chunking methods across the entire RAG pipeline. Moreover, HiChunk achieves better chunking quality within reasonable time consumption, thereby enhancing the overall performance of RAG systems.

Abstract: Online artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are an important component of digital health interventions. These online algorithms are designed to continually learn and improve their performance as streaming data is collected on individuals. Deploying online AI presents a key challenge: balancing adaptability of online AI with reproducibility. Online AI in digital interventions is a rapidly evolving area, driven by advances in algorithms, sensors, software, and devices. Digital health intervention development and deployment is a continuous process, where implementation - including the AI decision-making algorithm - is interspersed with cycles of re-development and optimization. Each deployment informs the next, making iterative deployment a defining characteristic of this field. This iterative nature underscores the importance of reproducibility: data collected across deployments must be accurately stored to have scientific utility, algorithm behavior must be auditable, and results must be comparable over time to facilitate scientific discovery and trustworthy refinement. This paper proposes a reproducible scientific workflow for developing, deploying, and analyzing online AI decision-making algorithms in digital health interventions. Grounded in practical experience from multiple real-world deployments, this workflow addresses key challenges to reproducibility across all phases of the online AI algorithm development life-cycle.

Abstract: Large Language Model agents excel at solving complex tasks through iterative reasoning and tool use, but typically depend on ultra-large, costly backbones. Existing distillation approaches train smaller students to imitate full teacher trajectories, yet reasoning and knowledge gaps between the teacher and student can cause compounding errors. We propose SCoRe, a student-centered framework in which the student generates training trajectories and the teacher corrects only the earliest error, producing training data matched to the student's ability and exposing specific weaknesses. The student is first fine-tuned on corrected trajectories. Subsequently, short-horizon reinforcement learning starts from the verified prefix preceding the earliest error, with target rewards assigned at that step. This design encourages autonomous problem-solving beyond imitation and enhances training stability. On 12 challenging benchmarks, a 7B-parameter student distilled with SCoRe matches the agentic performance of a 72B-parameter teacher.

Abstract: Bone health studies are crucial in medical practice for the early detection and treatment of Osteopenia and Osteoporosis. Clinicians usually make a diagnosis based on densitometry (DEXA scans) and patient history. The applications of AI in this field are ongoing research. Most successful methods rely on deep learning models that use vision alone (DEXA/X-ray imagery) and focus on prediction accuracy, while explainability is often disregarded and left to post hoc assessments of input contributions. We propose ProtoMedX, a multi-modal (multimodal) model that uses both DEXA scans of the lumbar spine and patient records. ProtoMedX's prototype-based architecture is explainable by design, which is crucial for medical applications, especially in the context of the upcoming EU AI Act, as it allows explicit analysis of model decisions, including incorrect ones. ProtoMedX demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in bone health classification while also providing explanations that can be visually understood by clinicians. Using a dataset of 4,160 real NHS patients, the proposed ProtoMedX achieves 87.58% accuracy in vision-only tasks and 89.8% in its multi-modal variant, both surpassing existing published methods.

arXiv:2509.15799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving safe and coordinated behavior in dynamic, constraint-rich environments remains a major challenge for learning-based control. Pure end-to-end learning often suffers from poor sample efficiency and limited reliability, while model-based methods depend on predefined references and struggle to generalize. We propose a hierarchical framework that combines tactical decision-making via reinforcement learning (RL) with low-level execution through Model Predictive Control (MPC). For the case of multi-agent systems this means that high-level policies select abstract targets from structured regions of interest (ROIs), while MPC ensures dynamically feasible and safe motion. Tested on a predator-prey benchmark, our approach outperforms end-to-end and shielding-based RL baselines in terms of reward, safety, and consistency, underscoring the benefits of combining structured learning with model-based control.

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (DLLMs) have recently attracted growing interest as an alternative to autoregressive decoders. In this work, we present an empirical study on using the diffusion-based large language model LLaDA for automatic speech recognition (ASR). We first investigate its use as an external deliberation-based processing module for Whisper-LLaMA transcripts. By leveraging the bidirectional attention and denoising capabilities of LLaDA, we explore random masking, low-confidence masking, and semi-autoregressive strategies, showing that Whisper-LLaDA substantially reduces WER compared with the baseline. On LibriSpeech, the best cascade system achieves 2.25%/4.94% WER on test-clean/test-other, representing a 12.3% relative improvement over the Whisper-LLaMA baseline on the test-other split. In contrast, a plain-text LLaDA without acoustic features fails to improve accuracy, highlighting the importance of audio-conditioned embeddings. We further evaluate Whisper-LLaDA as a standalone decoder for ASR with diffusion-based and semi-autoregressive decoding. Most experimental configurations achieve faster inference than the Whisper-LLaMA baseline, although recognition accuracy is slightly lower. These findings offer an empirical view of diffusion-based LLMs for ASR and point to promising directions for improvements.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in long-form, knowledge-grounded role-play dialogues remains challenging. This study compares LLM-generated and human-authored responses in multi-turn professional training simulations through human evaluation ($N=38$) and automated LLM-as-a-judge assessment. Human evaluation revealed significant degradation in LLM-generated response quality across turns, particularly in naturalness, context maintenance and overall quality, while human-authored responses progressively improved. In line with this finding, participants also indicated a consistent preference for human-authored dialogue. These human judgements were validated by our automated LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, where Gemini 2.0 Flash achieved strong alignment with human evaluators on both zero-shot pairwise preference and stochastic 6-shot construct ratings, confirming the widening quality gap between LLM and human responses over time. Our work contributes a multi-turn benchmark exposing LLM degradation in knowledge-grounded role-play dialogues and provides a validated hybrid evaluation framework to guide the reliable integration of LLMs in training simulations.

<title>Spiffy: Multiplying Diffusion LLM Acceleration via Lossless Speculative Decoding</title>

Abstract: Diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful alternative to autoregressive LLMs (AR-LLMs) with the potential to operate at significantly higher token generation rates. However, currently available open-source dLLMs often generate at much lower rates, typically decoding only a single token at every denoising timestep in order to maximize output quality. We present Spiffy, a speculative decoding algorithm that accelerates dLLM inference by $\mathbf{2.8{-}3.1\times}$ while provably preserving the model's output distribution. This work addresses the unique challenges involved in applying ideas from speculative decoding of AR-LLMs to the dLLM setting. Spiffy proposes draft states by leveraging the dLLM's distribution itself in an auto-speculative manner. This approach is efficient and effective, and eliminates the overheads of training and running an independent draft model. To structure the candidate draft states, we propose a novel directed draft graph which is uniquely designed to take advantage of the bidirectional, block-wise nature of dLLM generation and can be verified in parallel by the dLLM. To further optimize the structure of these draft graphs, we introduce an efficient, offline calibration algorithm that procedurally determines high-quality graph configurations. These optimized draft graphs, enabling increased acceptance rates, lead to a significant boost in the overall speedup achieved by the system. Crucially, Spiffy is also complementary to other recent innovations in improving dLLM generation speeds such as KV-caching and multi-token unmasking. We demonstrate that when combined with such parallel decoding algorithms, Spiffy is able to effectively multiply the benefits of these methods leading to total speedups of up to $\mathbf{7.9\times}$.

arXiv:2509.21670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce MORPH, a shape-agnostic, autoregressive foundation model for partial differential equations (PDEs). MORPH is built on a convolutional vision transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal datasets of varying data dimensionality (1D--3D) at different resolutions, multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorizes full spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters (LoRA), MORPH outperforms models trained from scratch in both zero-shot and full-shot generalization. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from heterogeneous and multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable and data-efficient scientific machine learning. The source code, datasets, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/lanl/MORPH.

Abstract: The immense computational cost of training Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a major barrier to innovation. While FP8 training offers a promising solution with significant theoretical efficiency gains, its widespread adoption has been hindered by the lack of a comprehensive, open-source training recipe. To bridge this gap, we introduce an end-to-end FP8 training recipe that seamlessly integrates continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. Our methodology employs a fine-grained, hybrid-granularity quantization strategy to maintain numerical fidelity while maximizing computational efficiency. Through extensive experiments, including the continue pre-training of models on a 160B-token corpus, we demonstrate that our recipe is not only remarkably stable but also essentially lossless, achieving performance on par with the BF16 baseline across a suite of reasoning benchmarks. Crucially, this is achieved with substantial efficiency improvements, including up to a 22% reduction in training time, a 14% decrease in peak memory usage, and a 19% increase in throughput. Our results establish FP8 as a practical and robust alternative to BF16, and we will release the accompanying code to further democratize large-scale model training.

<title>Learn the Ropes, Then Trust the Wins: Self-imitation with Progressive Exploration for Agentic Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is the dominant paradigm for sharpening strategic tool use capabilities of LLMs on long-horizon, sparsely-rewarded agent tasks, yet it faces a fundamental challenge of exploration-exploitation trade-off. Existing studies stimulate exploration through the lens of policy entropy, but such mechanical entropy maximization is prone to RL training instability due to the multi-turn distribution shifting. In this paper, we target the progressive exploration-exploitation balance under the guidance of the agent own experiences without succumbing to either entropy collapsing or runaway divergence. We propose SPEAR, a curriculum-based self-imitation learning (SIL) recipe for training agentic LLMs. It extends the vanilla SIL framework, where a replay buffer stores self-generated promising trajectories for off-policy update, by gradually steering the policy evolution within a well-balanced range of entropy across stages. Specifically, our approach incorporates a curriculum to manage the exploration process, utilizing intrinsic rewards to foster skill-level exploration and facilitating action-level exploration through SIL. At first, the auxiliary tool call reward plays a critical role in the accumulation of tool-use skills, enabling broad exposure to the unfamiliar distributions of the environment feedback with an upward entropy trend. As training progresses, self-imitation gets strengthened to exploit existing successful patterns from replayed experiences for comparative action-level exploration, accelerating solution iteration without unbounded entropy growth. To further stabilize training, we recalibrate the advantages of experiences in the replay buffer to address the potential policy drift. Reugularizations such as the clipping of tokens with high covariance between probability and advantage are introduced to the trajectory-level entropy control to curb over-confidence.

<title>Defending MoE LLMs against Harmful Fine-Tuning via Safety Routing Alignment</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22745</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.22745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have increasingly adopted the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture for efficiency. MoE-based LLMs heavily depend on a superficial safety mechanism in which harmful inputs are routed safety-critical experts. However, our analysis reveals that routing decisions for harmful inputs drift significantly after fine-tuning, exposing a critical vulnerability to harmful fine-tuning (HFT) attacks. Existing defenses, primarily designed for monolithic LLMs, are less effective for MoE LLMs as they fail to prevent drift in harmful input routing. To address this limitation, we propose SafeMoE, a safe fine-tuning method tailored to MoE LLMs. SafeMoE directly mitigates routing drift by penalizing the gap between the routing weights of a fine-tuned model and those of the initial safety-aligned model, thereby preserving the safety-aligned routing of harmful inputs to safety-critical experts. Experiments on open-source MoE LLMs ranging from 7B to 141B parameters demonstrate that SafeMoE effectively mitigates HFT attacks, reducing the harmfulness score of OLMoE from 62.0 to 5.0, for example, while maintaining task utility within 1% degradation and incurring only 2% overhead. It significantly outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods for safeguarding LLM fine-tuning and remains effective in recent large-scale MoE LLMs such as gpt-oss and Llama 4. Our implementation is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SafeMoE.

arXiv:2509.24528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D scene understanding is fundamental for embodied AI and robotics, supporting reliable perception for interaction and navigation. Recent approaches achieve zero-shot, open-vocabulary 3D semantic mapping by assigning embedding vectors to 2D class-agnostic masks generated via vision-language models (VLMs) and projecting these into 3D. However, these methods often produce fragmented masks and inaccurate semantic assignments due to the direct use of raw masks, limiting their effectiveness in complex environments. To address this, we leverage SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement to generate more accurate and numerous object-level masks, mitigating the over-segmentation commonly observed in mask generation models such as vanilla SAM, and improving downstream 3D semantic segmentation. To further enhance semantic context, we employ a context-aware CLIP encoding strategy that integrates multiple contextual views of each mask using empirically determined weighting, providing much richer visual context. We evaluate our approach on multiple 3D scene understanding tasks, including 3D semantic segmentation and object retrieval from language queries, across several benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: The systematic assessment of AI systems is increasingly vital as these technologies enter high-stakes domains. To address this, the EU's Artificial Intelligence Act introduces AI Regulatory Sandboxes (AIRS): supervised environments where AI systems can be tested under the oversight of Competent Authorities (CAs), balancing innovation with compliance, particularly for startups and SMEs. Yet significant challenges remain: assessment methods are fragmented, tests lack standardisation, and feedback loops between developers and regulators are weak. To bridge these gaps, we propose the Sandbox Configurator, a modular open-source framework that enables users to select domain-relevant tests from a shared library and generate customised sandbox environments with integrated dashboards. Its plug-in architecture aims to support both open and proprietary modules, fostering a shared ecosystem of interoperable AI assessment services. The framework aims to address multiple stakeholders: CAs gain structured workflows for applying legal obligations; technical experts can integrate robust evaluation methods; and AI providers access a transparent pathway to compliance. By promoting cross-border collaboration and standardisation, the Sandbox Configurator's goal is to support a scalable and innovation-friendly European infrastructure for trustworthy AI governance.

<title>Real-time Noise Detection and Classification in Single-Channel EEG: A Lightweight Machine Learning Approach for EMG, White Noise, and EOG Artifacts</title>

arXiv:2509.26058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) artifact detection in real-world settings faces significant challenges such as computational inefficiency in multi-channel methods, poor robustness to simultaneous noise, and trade-offs between accuracy and complexity in deep learning models. We propose a hybrid spectral-temporal framework for real-time detection and classification of ocular (EOG), muscular (EMG), and white noise artifacts in single-channel EEG. This method, in contrast to other approaches, combines time-domain low-pass filtering (targeting low-frequency EOG) and frequency-domain power spectral density (PSD) analysis (capturing broad-spectrum EMG), followed by PCA-optimized feature fusion to minimize redundancy while preserving discriminative information. This feature engineering strategy allows a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture to outperform advanced CNNs and RNNs by achieving 99% accuracy at low SNRs (SNR -7) dB and >90% accuracy in moderate noise (SNR 4 dB). Additionally, this framework addresses the unexplored problem of simultaneous multi-source contamination(EMG+EOG+white noise), where it maintains 96% classification accuracy despite overlapping artifacts. With 30-second training times (97% faster than CNNs) and robust performance across SNR levels, this framework bridges the gap between clinical applicability and computational efficiency, which enables real-time use in wearable brain-computer interfaces. This work also challenges the ubiquitous dependence on model depth for EEG artifact detection by demonstrating that domain-informed feature fusion surpasses complex architecture in noisy scenarios.

Abstract: Knowledge-graph retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) couples large language models (LLMs) with structured, verifiable knowledge graphs (KGs) to reduce hallucinations and expose reasoning traces. However, many KG-RAG systems compose multiple LLM modules (e.g planning, reasoning, and responding), inflating inference cost and binding behavior to a specific target KG. To address this, we introduce KG-R1, an agentic KG retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) framework through reinforcement learning (RL). KG-R1 utilizes a single agent that interacts with KGs as its environment, learning to retrieve at each step and incorporating the retrieved information into its reasoning and generation. The process is optimized through end-to-end RL. In controlled experiments across Knowledge-Graph Question Answering (KGQA) benchmarks, our method demonstrates both efficiency and transferability: Using Qwen-2.5-3B, KG-R1 improves answer accuracy with fewer generation tokens than prior multi-module workflow methods that use larger foundation or fine-tuned models. Furthermore, KG-R1 enables plug and play: after training, it maintains strong accuracy on new KGs without modification. These properties make KG-R1 a promising KG-RAG framework for real-world deployment. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Jinyeop3110/KG-R1.

Abstract: A dominant paradigm for teaching humanoid robots complex skills is to retarget human motions as kinematic references to train reinforcement learning (RL) policies. However, existing retargeting pipelines often struggle with the significant embodiment gap between humans and robots, producing physically implausible artifacts like foot-skating and penetration. More importantly, common retargeting methods neglect the rich human-object and human-environment interactions essential for expressive locomotion and loco-manipulation. To address this, we introduce OmniRetarget, an interaction-preserving data generation engine based on an interaction mesh that explicitly models and preserves the crucial spatial and contact relationships between an agent, the terrain, and manipulated objects. By minimizing the Laplacian deformation between the human and robot meshes while enforcing kinematic constraints, OmniRetarget generates kinematically feasible trajectories. Moreover, preserving task-relevant interactions enables efficient data augmentation, from a single demonstration to different robot embodiments, terrains, and object configurations. We comprehensively evaluate OmniRetarget by retargeting motions from OMOMO, LAFAN1, and our in-house MoCap datasets, generating over 8-hour trajectories that achieve better kinematic constraint satisfaction and contact preservation than widely used baselines. Such high-quality data enables proprioceptive RL policies to successfully execute long-horizon (up to 30 seconds) parkour and loco-manipulation skills on a Unitree G1 humanoid, trained with only 5 reward terms and simple domain randomization shared by all tasks, without any learning curriculum.

Abstract: We provide evidence that eigenanalysis of the empirical neural tangent kernel (eNTK) can surface the features used by trained neural networks. Across two standard toy models for mechanistic interpretability, Toy Models of Superposition (TMS) and a 1-layer MLP trained on modular addition, we find that the eNTK exhibits sharp spectral cliffs whose top eigenspaces align with ground-truth features. In TMS, the eNTK recovers the ground-truth features in both the sparse (high superposition) and dense regimes. In modular arithmetic, the eNTK can be used to recover Fourier feature families. Moreover, we provide evidence that a layerwise eNTK localizes features to specific layers and that the evolution of the eNTK spectrum can be used to diagnose the grokking phase transition. These results suggest that eNTK analysis may provide a practical handle for feature discovery and for detecting phase changes in small models.

Abstract: Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (ANNS) efficiently finds data items whose embeddings are close to that of a given query in a high-dimensional space, aiming to balance accuracy with speed. Used in recommendation systems, image and video retrieval, natural language processing, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), ANNS algorithms such as IVFPQ, HNSW graphs, Annoy, and MRPT utilize graph, tree, clustering, and quantization techniques to navigate large vector spaces. Despite this progress, ANNS systems spend up to 99\% of query time to compute distances in their final refinement phase. In this paper, we present PANORAMA, a machine learning-driven approach that tackles the ANNS verification bottleneck through data-adaptive learned orthogonal transforms that facilitate the accretive refinement of distance bounds. Such transforms compact over 90\% of signal energy into the first half of dimensions, enabling early candidate pruning with partial distance computations. We integrate PANORAMA into state-of-the-art ANNS methods, namely IVFPQ/Flat, HNSW, MRPT, and Annoy, without index modification, using level-major memory layouts, SIMD-vectorized partial distance computations, and cache-aware access patterns. Experiments across diverse datasets -- from image-based CIFAR-10 and GIST to modern embedding spaces including OpenAI's Ada 2 and Large 3 -- demonstrate that PANORAMA affords a 2--30$\times$ end-to-end speedup with no recall loss.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations -- unsupported content that undermines reliability. While most prior works frame hallucination detection as a binary task, many real-world applications require identifying hallucinated spans, which is a multi-step decision making process. This naturally raises the question of whether explicit reasoning can help the complex task of detecting hallucination spans. To answer this question, we first evaluate pretrained models with and without Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, and show that CoT reasoning has the potential to generate at least one correct answer when sampled multiple times. Motivated by this, we propose RL4HS, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes reasoning with a span-level reward function. RL4HS builds on Group Relative Policy Optimization and introduces Class-Aware Policy Optimization to mitigate reward imbalance issue. Experiments on the RAGTruth benchmark (summarization, question answering, data-to-text) show that RL4HS surpasses pretrained reasoning models and supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating the necessity of reinforcement learning with span-level rewards for detecting hallucination spans.

arXiv:2510.02227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising paradigm for enhancing the reasoning ability in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prevailing methods primarily rely on self-exploration or a single off-policy teacher to elicit long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) reasoning, which may introduce intrinsic model biases and restrict exploration, ultimately limiting reasoning diversity and performance. Drawing inspiration from multi-teacher strategies in knowledge distillation, we introduce Adaptive Multi-Guidance Policy Optimization (AMPO), a novel framework that adaptively leverages guidance from multiple proficient teacher models, but only when the on-policy model fails to generate correct solutions. This "guidance-on-demand" approach expands exploration while preserving the value of self-discovery. Moreover, AMPO incorporates a comprehension-based selection mechanism, prompting the student to learn from the reasoning paths that it is most likely to comprehend, thus balancing broad exploration with effective exploitation. Extensive experiments show AMPO substantially outperforms a strong baseline (GRPO), with a 4.3% improvement on mathematical reasoning tasks and 12.2% on out-of-distribution tasks, while significantly boosting Pass@k performance and enabling more diverse exploration. Notably, using four peer-sized teachers, our method achieves comparable results to approaches that leverage a single, more powerful teacher (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) with more data. These results demonstrate a more efficient and scalable path to superior reasoning and generalizability. Our code is available at https://github.com/SII-Enigma/AMPO.

Abstract: We introduce Equilibrium Matching (EqM), a generative modeling framework built from an equilibrium dynamics perspective. EqM discards the non-equilibrium, time-conditional dynamics in traditional diffusion and flow-based generative models and instead learns the equilibrium gradient of an implicit energy landscape. Through this approach, we can adopt an optimization-based sampling process at inference time, where samples are obtained by gradient descent on the learned landscape with adjustable step sizes, adaptive optimizers, and adaptive compute. EqM surpasses the generation performance of diffusion/flow models empirically, achieving an FID of 1.90 on ImageNet 256$\times$256. EqM is also theoretically justified to learn and sample from the data manifold. Beyond generation, EqM is a flexible framework that naturally handles tasks including partially noised image denoising, OOD detection, and image composition. By replacing time-conditional velocities with a unified equilibrium landscape, EqM offers a tighter bridge between flow and energy-based models and a simple route to optimization-driven inference.

Abstract: Academic presentation videos have become an essential medium for research communication, yet producing them remains highly labor-intensive, often requiring hours of slide design, recording, and editing for a short 2 to 10 minutes video. Unlike natural video, presentation video generation involves distinctive challenges: inputs from research papers, dense multi-modal information (text, figures, tables), and the need to coordinate multiple aligned channels such as slides, subtitles, speech, and human talker. To address these challenges, we introduce Paper2Video, the first benchmark of 101 research papers paired with author-created presentation videos, slides, and speaker metadata. We further design four tailored evaluation metrics--Meta Similarity, PresentArena, PresentQuiz, and IP Memory--to measure how videos convey the paper's information to the audience. Building on this foundation, we propose PaperTalker, the first multi-agent framework for academic presentation video generation. It integrates slide generation with effective layout refinement by a novel effective tree search visual choice, cursor grounding, subtitling, speech synthesis, and talking-head rendering, while parallelizing slide-wise generation for efficiency. Experiments on Paper2Video demonstrate that the presentation videos produced by our approach are more faithful and informative than existing baselines, establishing a practical step toward automated and ready-to-use academic video generation. Our dataset, agent, and code are available at https://github.com/showlab/Paper2Video.

<div> Keywords: temporal reasoning, large language models, real-world challenges, benchmark, social interactions <br />
Summary: <br />
Temporal reasoning is essential for Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand the real world, but current approaches do not adequately address the challenges of dealing with abundant temporal information, rapidly changing event dynamics, and complex dependencies in social interactions. To address this gap, a multi-level benchmark called TIME has been introduced, featuring 38,522 QA pairs across three levels and 11 sub-tasks. The benchmark includes three sub-datasets - TIME-Wiki, TIME-News, and TIME-Dial - each reflecting different real-world challenges. Extensive experiments were conducted on both reasoning and non-reasoning models, analyzing temporal reasoning performance across diverse scenarios and tasks.

Abstract: Temporal reasoning is pivotal for Large Language Models (LLMs) to comprehend the real world. However, existing works neglect the real-world challenges for temporal reasoning: (1) intensive temporal information, (2) fast-changing event dynamics, and (3) complex temporal dependencies in social interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose a multi-level benchmark TIME, designed for temporal reasoning in real-world scenarios. TIME consists of 38,522 QA pairs, covering 3 levels with 11 fine-grained sub-tasks. This benchmark encompasses 3 sub-datasets reflecting different real-world challenges: TIME-Wiki, TIME-News, and TIME-Dial. We conduct extensive experiments on reasoning models and non-reasoning models. And we conducted an in-depth analysis of temporal reasoning performance across diverse real-world scenarios and tasks, and summarized the impact of test-time scaling on temporal reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we release TIME-Lite, a human-annotated subset to foster future research and standardized evaluation in temporal reasoning. The code is available at https://github.com/sylvain-wei/TIME , the dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/SylvainWei/TIME , and the project page link is https://sylvain-wei.github.io/TIME/ .

<div> benchmark, LLM-judged, schematic adherence, psychometric validity, factor collapse  
Summary:  
The article discusses the use of LLM-judged benchmarks to evaluate complex model behaviors, highlighting the design issues that can lead to unreliable rankings. Two diagnostic mechanisms, schematic adherence and psychometric validity, are introduced to identify inconsistencies and uncertainty in benchmarking runs. A case study on Arena-Hard Auto reveals severe schema incoherence and factor collapse among popular judges, indicating high levels of unexplained variance and factor correlations. The study also shows that the ELO-style aggregation method used by Arena-Hard Auto masks genuine ranking uncertainty. The results underscore the importance of building better-scoped, reliability-aware LLM-judged benchmarks to ensure validity in model evaluations. The code and dataset for the study are available on GitHub for further exploration.

Abstract: LLM-judged benchmarks are increasingly used to evaluate complex model behaviors, yet their design introduces failure modes absent in conventional ground-truth based benchmarks. We argue that without tight objectives and verifiable constructions, benchmark rankings can produce high-confidence rankings that are in fact largely noise. We introduce two mechanisms to diagnose these issues. Schematic adherence quantifies how much of a judge's overall verdict is explained by the explicit evaluation schema, revealing unexplained variance when judges deviate from their own rubric. Psychometric validity aggregates internal consistency and discriminant validity signals to quantify irreducible uncertainty in any benchmarking run. Applying these tools to Arena-Hard Auto, we find severe schema incoherence and factor collapse across popular judges: for example, unexplained variance exceeding 90 percent for DeepSeek-R1-32B and factor correlations above 0.93 for most criteria. We also show that the ELO-style aggregation used by Arena-Hard Auto collapses and masks genuine ranking uncertainty. Our results highlight design failures that undermine validity and offer actionable principles for building better-scoped, reliability-aware LLM-judged benchmarks. We released our code and dataset at https://github.com/penfever/judgment-to-noise

<div> Keywords: AlphaApollo, self-evolving reasoning system, foundation model, computation tool, retrieval tool <br />
Summary: 
AlphaApollo is a self-evolving agentic reasoning system designed to overcome limitations in foundation models (FMs). It addresses bottlenecks such as model capacity and test-time iteration reliability by using professional tools like Python with numerical and symbolic libraries for computation and task-relevant external information for decision-making. The system supports multi-round, multi-model solution evolution through a shared state map that facilitates iterative refinement. Evaluations on AIME 2024/2025 show consistent performance gains across multiple models, with improved Average@32 and Pass@32 metrics. Tool-use analysis reveals a high success rate for tool calls, outperforming non-tool baselines and expanding the capability of FMs. Further details and results can be found at the official AlphaApollo Github repository. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We present AlphaApollo, a self-evolving agentic reasoning system that aims to address two bottlenecks in foundation model (FM) reasoning-limited model-intrinsic capacity and unreliable test-time iteration. AlphaApollo orchestrates multiple models with professional tools to enable deliberate, verifiable reasoning. It couples (i) a computation tool (Python with numerical and symbolic libraries) and (ii) a retrieval tool (task-relevant external information) to execute exact calculations and ground decisions. The system further supports multi-round, multi-model solution evolution via a shared state map that records candidates, executable checks, and feedback for iterative refinement. In evaluations on AIME 2024/2025 across multiple models, AlphaApollo delivers consistent gains: +5.15% Average@32 and +23.34% Pass@32 for Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, and +8.91% Average@32 with +26.67% Pass@32 for Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. Tool-use analysis shows that more than 80% of tool calls are successfully executed, with consistent outperformance of non-tool baselines, thereby lifting the capability ceiling of FMs. More empirical results and implementation details will be updated at https://github.com/tmlr-group/AlphaApollo.

<div> Keywords: AI, reasoning, generalization, Complexity OoD, Kolmogorov complexity

Summary:
Complexity Out of Distribution (Complexity OoD) generalization framework is proposed to define and measure reasoning ability in AI models. It focuses on maintaining performance on test instances with higher solution complexity than training examples. The concept of complexity is formalized using solution description Kolmogorov complexity and operational proxies. This approach unifies learning and reasoning, highlighting the transition from System1 to System2 processing under complexity pressure. Recommendations are provided for incorporating complexity into benchmark design, enhancing supervision targeting solution traces, and addressing learning to reason challenges. Scaling data alone is insufficient for solving Complexity OoD, requiring architectures and training regimes that explicitly model and allocate computation based on complexity. Progress toward robust reasoning involves designing inductive biases and addressing spurious shortcuts, semantic robustness, catastrophic forgetting, and step-wise calibration. <div>
arXiv:2510.06274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress has pushed AI frontiers from pattern recognition tasks toward problems that require step by step, System2 style reasoning, especially with large language models. Yet, unlike learning, where generalization and out of distribution (OoD) evaluation concepts are well formalized, there is no clear, consistent definition or metric for reasoning ability. We propose Complexity Out of Distribution (Complexity OoD) generalization as a framework and problem setting to define and measure reasoning. A model exhibits Complexity OoD generalization when it maintains performance on test instances whose minimal required solution complexity, either representational (richer solution structure) or computational (more reasoning steps/program length), exceeds that of all training examples. We formalize complexity via solution description Kolmogorov complexity and operational proxies (e.g., object/relation counts; reasoning step counts), clarifying how Complexity OoD differs from length and compositional OoD. This lens unifies learning and reasoning: many cases solvable with System1 like processing at low complexity become System2 like under complexity pressure, while System2 can be viewed as generalization over solution structures. We translate this perspective into practice with recommendations for operationalizing Complexity OoD across the stack: incorporating complexity into benchmark and evaluation metric design, rethinking supervision to target solution traces, seeking and designing inductive biases for Complexity OoD generalization, addressing learning to reason spillovers such as spurious shortcuts, semantic robustness, catastrophic forgetting, and step wise calibration. Because Complexity OoD cannot be solved by scaling data alone, progress toward robust reasoning will require architectures and training regimes that explicitly model and allocate computation with respect to complexity.

<div> Keywords: AI models, exploration, learning through interaction, BuilderBench, embodied reasoning

Summary: 
BuilderBench is introduced as a benchmark for accelerating research in agent pre-training focused on open-ended exploration. The benchmark requires agents to learn how to build various structures using blocks, with a task suite containing over 42 diverse target structures. Agents must explore and learn general principles about the environment without external supervision, testing their understanding of physics, mathematics, and long-horizon planning. The tasks in BuilderBench challenge current algorithms, highlighting the need for embodied reasoning and experimentation. A "training wheels" protocol is provided for agents to build a single target structure from the task suite. Additionally, single-file implementations of six different algorithms are provided as a reference for researchers. The goal is to enable agents to learn through interaction and exploration, moving beyond mimicry and sharpening to solve novel problems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today's AI models learn primarily through mimicry and sharpening, so it is not surprising that they struggle to solve problems beyond the limits set by existing data. To solve novel problems, agents should acquire skills for exploring and learning through experience. Finding a scalable learning mechanism for developing agents that learn through interaction remains a major open problem. In this work, we introduce BuilderBench, a benchmark to accelerate research into agent pre-training that centers open-ended exploration. BuilderBench requires agents to learn how to build any structure using blocks. BuilderBench is equipped with $(1)$ a hardware accelerated simulator of a robotic agent interacting with various physical blocks, and $(2)$ a task-suite with over 42 diverse target structures that are carefully curated to test an understanding of physics, mathematics, and long-horizon planning. During training, agents have to explore and learn general principles about the environment without any external supervision. During evaluation, agents have to build the unseen target structures from the task suite. Solving these tasks requires a sort of \emph{embodied reasoning} that is not reflected in words but rather in actions, experimenting with different strategies and piecing them together. Our experiments show that many of these tasks challenge the current iteration of algorithms. Hence, we also provide a ``training wheels'' protocol, in which agents are trained and evaluated to build a single target structure from the task suite. Finally, we provide single-file implementations of six different algorithms as a reference point for researchers.

<div> Keywords: post-merger integration, information system integration, game-based learning design, AMILI, AMILP

Summary:
Post-merger integration presents challenges for information system integration, lacking training in this area. The study proposes addressing this gap through game-based learning design. By transforming static method training into an engaging learning experience, the study aims to improve the effectiveness of training for information system integration in post-merger scenarios. Analyzing foundational learning theories, cognitive load, motivation models, and serious game design frameworks, essential requirements for a game-based learning design framework are identified. The framework will focus on the transformation process and resulting learning experience to enhance learner engagement and effectiveness. The paper outlines a plan for developing and evaluating the proposed framework through iterative design and real-world validation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-merger integration states unique challenges for professionals responsible for information system integration aimed on alignment and combination diverse system architectures of merging organizations. Although the theoretical and practical guidance exists for post-merger integration on the business level, there is a significant gap in training for information system integration in this context. In prior research specific methods AMILI (Support method for informed decision identification) and AMILP (Support method for informed decision-making) were introduced for the support of information system integration decisions in the post-merger integration. But during the practical application was reported high learning curve and low learner motivation. This paper explores how game-based learning design can address these limitations by transforming static method training into engaging learning experience. The study analyzes foundational learning theories, cognitive load and motivation models, and serious game design frameworks to identify the essential requirements for a game-based learning design framework tailored to information system integration in post-merger integration. Requirements are structured in two components: the transformation process and resulting learning experience. The paper concludes with a plan for developing and evaluating the proposed framework through iterative design and real-world validation.

<div> Keywords: multi-agent system, natural language processing, consensus-seeking, optimal collaborators, Belief-Calibrated Consensus Seeking (BCCS)

Summary:
A new approach called Belief-Calibrated Consensus Seeking (BCCS) is introduced to enhance the capacity of multi-agent systems in solving complex natural language processing tasks. This framework focuses on selecting optimal collaborators to maximize consensus stability by calibrating the consensus judgment based on system-internal beliefs. Existing consensus-seeking methods often overlook contradictions in system-internal beliefs, leading to instability in the consensus. By providing a theoretical framework for optimal collaborator selection, the BCCS framework outperforms existing approaches in accuracy on challenging tasks. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show significant improvements, making the BCCS framework a promising solution for enhancing collaboration among multiple agents in NLP tasks. The code and data for the BCCS framework are available on GitHub for further exploration and development. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multi-agent system (MAS) enhances its capacity to solve complex natural language processing (NLP) tasks through collaboration among multiple agents, where consensus-seeking serves as a fundamental mechanism. However, existing consensus-seeking approaches typically rely on voting mechanisms to judge consensus, overlooking contradictions in system-internal beliefs that destabilize the consensus. Moreover, these methods often involve agents updating their results through indiscriminate collaboration with every other agent. Such uniform interaction fails to identify the optimal collaborators for each agent, hindering the emergence of a stable consensus. To address these challenges, we provide a theoretical framework for selecting optimal collaborators that maximize consensus stability. Based on the theorems, we propose the Belief-Calibrated Consensus Seeking (BCCS) framework to facilitate stable consensus via selecting optimal collaborators and calibrating the consensus judgment by system-internal beliefs. Experimental results on the MATH and MMLU benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed BCCS framework outperforms the best existing results by 2.23% and 3.95% of accuracy on challenging tasks, respectively. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/dengwentao99/BCCS.

<div> Collaboration, Reasoning LLMs, Off-trajectory reasoning, Recoverability, Guidability

Summary:
This study investigates the ability of Reasoning LLMs to engage in off-trajectory reasoning by collaborating on each other's thinking within shared trajectories. The authors propose twin tests to evaluate the recoverability and guidability of LLMs, finding that stronger LLMs on benchmarks are more fragile under distractions. All models tested fail to effectively leverage guidance from collaborators beyond their inherent capabilities. Control studies isolate the effects of post-training factors on LLM behaviors, revealing that suboptimal recoverability behaviors of teacher models are transferred to student models even with correct distillation trajectories. The study provides insights for training strong reasoning collaborators and highlights the limitations of off-the-shelf reasoning LLMs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning LLMs are trained to verbalize their reasoning process, yielding strong gains on complex tasks. This transparency also opens a promising direction: multiple reasoners can directly collaborate on each other's thinking within a shared trajectory, yielding better inference efficiency and exploration. A key prerequisite, however, is the ability to assess the usefulness and build on another model's partial thinking -- we call this off-trajectory reasoning. Our paper investigates a critical question: can standard solo-reasoning training pipelines deliver desired off-trajectory behaviors? We propose twin tests that capture the two extremes of the off-trajectory spectrum, namely Recoverability, which tests whether LLMs can backtrack from "distractions" induced by misleading reasoning traces, and Guidability, which tests their ability to build upon correct reasoning from stronger collaborators. Our study evaluates 15 open-weight LLMs (1.5B-32B) and reveals a counterintuitive finding -- "stronger" LLMs on benchmarks are often more fragile under distraction. Moreover, all models tested fail to effectively leverage guiding steps from collaborators on problems beyond their inherent capabilities with solve rates remaining under 9.2%. Finally, we conduct control studies to isolate the effects of three factors in post-training on these behaviors: the choice of distillation teacher, the use of RL, and data selection strategy. Our results provide actionable insights for training natively strong reasoning collaborators; e.g., we find that suboptimal recoverability behaviors of teacher models are transferred to distilled students even if the distillation trajectories are correct. Taken together, this work lays the groundwork for evaluating multi-model collaborations in shared reasoning trajectories and highlights the limitations of off-the-shelf reasoning LLMs.

Abstract: The focus on "food as medicine" is gaining traction in the field of health and several studies conducted in the past few years discussed this aspect of food in the literature. However, very little research has been done on representing the relationship between food and health in a standardized, machine-readable format using a semantic web that can help us leverage this knowledge effectively. To address this gap, this study aims to create a knowledge graph to link food and health through the knowledge graph's ability to combine information from various platforms focusing on flavonoid contents of food found in the USDA databases and cancer connections found in the literature. We looked closely at these relationships using KNARM methodology and represented them in machine-operable format. The proposed knowledge graph serves as an example for researchers, enabling them to explore the complex interplay between dietary choices and disease management. Future work for this study involves expanding the scope of the knowledge graph by capturing nuances, adding more related data, and performing inferences on the acquired knowledge to uncover hidden relationships.

Abstract: This work investigates the reasoning and planning capabilities of foundation models and their scalability in complex, dynamic environments. We introduce PuzzlePlex, a benchmark designed to assess these capabilities through a diverse set of puzzles. PuzzlePlex consists of 15 types of puzzles, including deterministic and stochastic games of varying difficulty, as well as single-player and two-player scenarios. The PuzzlePlex framework provides a comprehensive environment for each game, and supports extensibility to generate more challenging instances as foundation models evolve. Additionally, we implement customized game-playing strategies for comparison. Building on this benchmark, we develop fine-grained metrics to measure performance and conduct an in-depth analysis of frontier foundation models across two settings: instruction-based and code-based. Furthermore, we systematically investigate their scaling limits. Our findings show that reasoning models outperform others in instruction-based settings, while code-based execution presents greater challenges but offers a scalable and efficient alternative. PuzzlePlex enables targeted evaluation and guides future improvements in reasoning, planning, and generalization for foundation models.

Summary:<br />
- The paper presents a reasoning-driven pipeline for agentic search using large language models. 
- Successful agentic search trajectories exhibit four beneficial reasoning behaviors: Information Verification, Authority Evaluation, Adaptive Search, and Error Recovery.
- The technique of Behavior Priming is proposed to train more effective agentic search models by integrating desired reasoning behaviors through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.
- Experiments show a significant performance improvement using behavior priming compared to direct training with reinforcement learning.
- The critical factor for strong final performance is the desired reasoning behaviors in the supervised fine-tuning data, rather than the correctness of the final answer. Effective reasoning behaviors lead to better exploration and scaling capabilities, providing a strong foundation for reinforcement learning. The code for the proposed technique will be made available as open source. <div>
arXiv:2510.06534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic search leverages large language models (LLMs) to interpret complex user information needs and execute a multi-step process of planning, searching, and synthesizing information to provide answers. This paradigm introduces unique challenges for LLMs' reasoning and agentic capabilities when interacting with retrieval systems and the broader web. In this paper, we propose a reasoning-driven LLM-based pipeline to study effective reasoning behavior patterns in agentic search. Using this pipeline, we analyze successful agentic search trajectories and identify four beneficial reasoning behaviors: Information Verification, Authority Evaluation, Adaptive Search, and Error Recovery. Based on these findings, we propose a technique called Behavior Priming to train more effective agentic search models. It synthesizes agentic search trajectories that exhibit these four behaviors and integrates them into the agentic search model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by standard reinforcement learning (RL). Experiments on three benchmarks (GAIA, WebWalker, and HLE) demonstrate that behavior priming yields over 35% gains in Llama3.2-3B and Qwen3-1.7B compared to directly training agentic search models with RL. Crucially, we demonstrate that the desired reasoning behaviors in the SFT data, rather than the correctness of the final answer, is the critical factor for achieving strong final performance after RL: fine-tuning on trajectories with desirable reasoning behaviors but incorrect answers leads to better performance than fine-tuning on trajectories with correct answers. Our analysis further reveals the underlying mechanism: the introduced reasoning behaviors endow models with more effective exploration (higher pass@k and entropy) and test-time scaling (longer trajectories) capabilities, providing a strong foundation for RL. Our code will be released as open source.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new framework called Auto-Prompt Ensemble (APE) that aims to enhance the reliability of Large Language Model (LLM) judges by incorporating additional evaluation dimensions. LLM judges often fail to capture implicit assessment standards, leading to missed crucial evaluation dimensions. APE addresses this by automatically learning evaluation dimensions from failure cases and using a confidence-based ensemble mechanism called Collective Confidence to determine when to include additional evaluation dimensions. Through extensive experiments, APE is shown to improve the reliability of LLM Judge across various benchmarks, such as enhancing GPT-4o agreement rate on Reward Bench from 87.2% to 90.5% in the zero-shot setting. Overall, APE provides a structured approach for LLM judges to leverage test-time computation and bridge the gap between human and LLM assessments.

Abstract: We present a novel framework that improves the reliability of LLM judges by selectively augmenting LLM with auxiliary evaluation dimensions. Existing LLM judges often miss crucial evaluation dimensions because they fail to recognize the implicit standards underlying human assessments. To address this challenge, we propose the Auto-Prompt Ensemble (APE), an adaptive framework that automatically learns evaluation dimensions from its failure cases. APE incorporates a confidence-based ensemble mechanism to decide when to adopt the judgments from additional evaluation dimensions through a novel confidence estimation approach called Collective Confidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that APE improves the reliability of LLM Judge across diverse standard benchmarks. For instance, APE enhances GPT-4o agreement rate on Reward Bench from 87.2% to 90.5% in the zero-shot setting. Overall, APE provides a principled approach for LLM Judge to leverage test-time computation, and bridge the evaluation gap between human and LLM judges.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces WebDART, a framework designed to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) agents in handling complex web tasks. WebDART dynamically breaks down objectives into navigation, information extraction, and execution subtasks, allowing the model to focus on one skill at a time. It continuously adjusts this decomposition as new webpages are encountered, optimizing exploration and utilizing newly discovered filters or shortcuts. In evaluations on WebChoreArena, WebDART significantly improves success rates compared to previous state-of-the-art agents, particularly in long-horizon navigation tasks. While maintaining performance levels on simpler tasks in the WebArena suite, WebDART completes objectives with fewer navigation steps, showcasing its effectiveness in tackling challenging web tasks.<br />

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are becoming competent at straightforward web tasks, such as opening an item page or submitting a form, but still struggle with objectives that require long horizon navigation, large scale information extraction, and reasoning under constraints. We present WebDART, a general framework that enables a single LLM to handle such complex chores. WebDART (i) dynamically decomposes each objective into three focused subtasks: navigation, information extraction, and execution, so the model concentrates on one skill at a time, and (ii) continuously replans the decomposition as new webpages are revealed, taking advantage of newly discovered filters or shortcuts and avoiding redundant exploration. Evaluated on WebChoreArena, WebDART lifts success rates by up to 13.7 percentage points over previous SOTA agents, while matching their performance on the easier WebArena suite and completing tasks with up to 14.7 fewer navigation steps.

<div> Keywords: emotion recognition, fine-grained, decision-making, prototype theory, In-Context Learning

Summary:
Emotion recognition is vital in various systems, using In-Context Learning (ICL) to enhance reasoning processes. However, ICL methods often overlook the decision-making process, leading to errors in emotion recognition. This paper explores decision-making in fine-grained emotion recognition using prototype theory. Emotion In-Context Learning (EICL) is proposed to improve query representations by incorporating emotionally similar examples and utilizing a dynamic soft-label strategy. The approach outperforms ICL by optimizing both reasoning and decision-making processes through a two-stage exclusion strategy, leading to improved accuracy in emotion recognition on multiple datasets. EICL addresses the challenge of emotional discrepancies introduced by semantically similar examples, allowing for more accurate representations and enhanced decision-making. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Fine-grained emotion recognition aims to identify the emotional type in queries through reasoning and decision-making processes, playing a crucial role in various systems. Recent methods use In-Context Learning (ICL), enhancing the representation of queries in the reasoning process through semantically similar examples, while further improving emotion recognition by explaining the reasoning mechanisms. However, these methods enhance the reasoning process but overlook the decision-making process. This paper investigates decision-making in fine-grained emotion recognition through prototype theory. We show that ICL relies on similarity matching between query representations and emotional prototypes within the model, where emotion-accurate representations are critical. However, semantically similar examples often introduce emotional discrepancies, hindering accurate representations and causing errors. To address this, we propose Emotion In-Context Learning (EICL), which introduces emotionally similar examples and uses a dynamic soft-label strategy to improve query representations in the emotion reasoning process. A two-stage exclusion strategy is then employed to assess similarity from multiple angles, further optimizing the decision-making process. Extensive experiments show that EICL significantly outperforms ICL on multiple datasets.

Summary: 
An Agent-in-the-Loop (AITL) framework is introduced to continuously enhance an LLM-based customer support system by integrating various types of annotations directly into live customer operations. These annotations include pairwise response preferences, agent adoption and rationales, knowledge relevance checks, and identification of missing knowledge. By incorporating these feedback signals into model updates, retraining cycles are significantly reduced from months to weeks. A production pilot with US-based customer support agents showed notable enhancements in retrieval accuracy, generation quality, and agent adoption rates. The results highlight the efficiency of embedding human feedback loops into operational workflows for constant refinement of LLM-based customer support systems. <div>

Abstract: We introduce an Agent-in-the-Loop (AITL) framework that implements a continuous data flywheel for iteratively improving an LLM-based customer support system. Unlike standard offline approaches that rely on batch annotations, AITL integrates four key types of annotations directly into live customer operations: (1) pairwise response preferences, (2) agent adoption and rationales, (3) knowledge relevance checks, and (4) identification of missing knowledge. These feedback signals seamlessly feed back into models' updates, reducing retraining cycles from months to weeks. Our production pilot involving US-based customer support agents demonstrated significant improvements in retrieval accuracy (+11.7% recall@75, +14.8% precision@8), generation quality (+8.4% helpfulness) and agent adoption rates (+4.5%). These results underscore the effectiveness of embedding human feedback loops directly into operational workflows to continuously refine LLM-based customer support system.

<div> Keywords: automated design, meta-agents, agent architectures, behavioral diversity, economic viability

Summary: 
Automated design of agentic systems using meta-agents faces several challenges. Firstly, incorporating all previous agent designs for learning across iterations does not perform well; an evolutionary approach yields better results. Secondly, while meta-agents design multiple agents during training, they often select only one for deployment, resulting in low behavioral diversity among the designed agents. Additionally, the high cost of designing and deploying automated agents may only be economically viable for specific datasets. Cost analysis shows that the overall cost of automated agent design is lower than that of human-designed agents for only two datasets when deployed on a large scale, indicating limited economic benefits for other datasets. This study emphasizes the importance of addressing these challenges to enhance the practicality and cost-effectiveness of automated design in agentic systems. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works began to automate the design of agentic systems using meta-agents that propose and iteratively refine new agent architectures. In this paper, we examine three key challenges in a common class of meta-agents. First, we investigate how a meta-agent learns across iterations and find that simply expanding the context with all previous agents, as proposed by previous works, performs worse than ignoring prior designs entirely. We show that the performance improves with an evolutionary approach. Second, although the meta-agent designs multiple agents during training, it typically commits to a single agent at test time. We find that the designed agents have low behavioral diversity, limiting the potential for their complementary use. Third, we assess when automated design is economically viable. We find that only in a few cases--specifically, two datasets--the overall cost of designing and deploying the agents is lower than that of human-designed agents when deployed on over 15,000 examples. In contrast, the performance gains for other datasets do not justify the design cost, regardless of scale.

arXiv:2510.06742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the integration of knowledge graphs (KGs) in biomedical and cognitive sciences, overcoming limitations in traditional machine learning methods for capturing intricate semantic links among genes, diseases, and cognitive processes. We introduce MultiCNKG, an innovative framework that merges three key knowledge sources: the Cognitive Neuroscience Knowledge Graph (CNKG) with 2.9K nodes and 4.3K edges across 9 node types and 20 edge types; Gene Ontology (GO) featuring 43K nodes and 75K edges in 3 node types and 4 edge types; and Disease Ontology (DO) comprising 11.2K nodes and 8.8K edges with 1 node type and 2 edge types. Leveraging LLMs like GPT-4, we conduct entity alignment, semantic similarity computation, and graph augmentation to create a cohesive KG that interconnects genetic mechanisms, neurological disorders, and cognitive functions. The resulting MultiCNKG encompasses 6.9K nodes across 5 types (e.g., Genes, Diseases, Cognitive Processes) and 11.3K edges spanning 7 types (e.g., Causes, Associated with, Regulates), facilitating a multi-layered view from molecular to behavioral domains. Assessments using metrics such as precision (85.20%), recall (87.30%), coverage (92.18%), graph consistency (82.50%), novelty detection (40.28%), and expert validation (89.50%) affirm its robustness and coherence. Link prediction evaluations with models like TransE (MR: 391, MRR: 0.411) and RotatE (MR: 263, MRR: 0.395) show competitive performance against benchmarks like FB15k-237 and WN18RR. This KG advances applications in personalized medicine, cognitive disorder diagnostics, and hypothesis formulation in cognitive neuroscience.

<div> tool, verification, language model, sequential decision-making, safety property

Summary:
A new tool has been introduced for the rigorous and automated verification of large language model (LLM)-based policies in memoryless sequential decision-making tasks. The tool constructs the reachable portion of the Markov decision process guided by the LLM's chosen actions and checks if the policy satisfies specified safety requirements expressed as a PCTL formula. Each state is represented as a natural language prompt, and the LLM's response is parsed into an action to expand reachable successor states. Experiments on standard grid world benchmarks show that LLMs accessed via Ollama can be verified when deterministically seeded but generally perform under deep reinforcement learning baselines. The tool integrates with Ollama and supports PRISM-specified tasks, enabling continuous benchmarking in user-specified sequential decision-making tasks and laying a practical foundation for formally verifying increasingly capable LLMs.

Abstract: We introduce a tool for rigorous and automated verification of large language model (LLM)- based policies in memoryless sequential decision-making tasks. Given a Markov decision process (MDP) representing the sequential decision-making task, an LLM policy, and a safety requirement expressed as a PCTL formula, our approach incrementally constructs only the reachable portion of the MDP guided by the LLM's chosen actions. Each state is encoded as a natural language prompt, the LLM's response is parsed into an action, and reachable successor states by the policy are expanded. The resulting formal model is checked with Storm to determine whether the policy satisfies the specified safety property. In experiments on standard grid world benchmarks, we show that open source LLMs accessed via Ollama can be verified when deterministically seeded, but generally underperform deep reinforcement learning baselines. Our tool natively integrates with Ollama and supports PRISM-specified tasks, enabling continuous benchmarking in user-specified sequential decision-making tasks and laying a practical foundation for formally verifying increasingly capable LLMs.

Summary:   
The article introduces the Double-Loop Multi-Agent (DLMA) framework for automating the scientific research process. The framework consists of two loops, with professor agents evolving research plans in the leader loop, and doctoral student agents executing the plans in the follower loop. Through evolutionary algorithms and dynamic plan adjustments, the DLMA framework generates high-quality research papers that outperform baselines in automated evaluation. Ablation studies confirm the importance of both loops in driving novelty and ensuring soundness throughout the research process. The proposed approach addresses the challenges of automated research by effectively combining high-level planning with adaptable execution, resulting in state-of-the-art research outcomes.

Abstract: Automating the end-to-end scientific research process poses a fundamental challenge: it requires both evolving high-level plans that are novel and sound, and executing these plans correctly amidst dynamic and uncertain conditions. To address this bilevel challenge, we propose a novel Double-Loop Multi-Agent (DLMA) framework to solve the given research problem automatically. The leader loop, composed of professor agents, is responsible for evolving research plans. It employs an evolutionary algorithm through involvement, improvement, and integration meetings to iteratively generate and refine a pool of research proposals, exploring the solution space effectively. The follower loop, composed of doctoral student agents, is responsible for executing the best-evolved plan. It dynamically adjusts the plan during implementation via pre-hoc and post-hoc meetings, ensuring each step (e.g., drafting, coding) is well-supported by contextual and external observations. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like ACLAward and Laboratory show that DLMA generates research papers that achieve state-of-the-art scores in automated evaluation, significantly outperforming strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm the critical roles of both loops, with evolution driving novelty and execution ensuring soundness.

Summary: 
Autoformalization is crucial for Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) due to data scarcity. The Autoformalizer with Tool Feedback (ATF) is a novel approach that incorporates syntax and consistency tools to improve formalization. By using Lean 4 compilers for syntax corrections and multiple language models for consistency validation, ATF refines generated statements. The training process involves a cold-start phase, expert iteration phase, and Direct Preference Optimization. Experimental results demonstrate ATF outperforms baseline models and human evaluations confirm its superiority. ATF also exhibits strong inference scaling properties. The open-source Numina-ATF dataset containing 750K synthetic formal statements is provided to drive advancements in autoformalization and ATP research. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoformalization addresses the scarcity of data for Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) by translating mathematical problems from natural language into formal statements. Efforts in recent work shift from directly prompting large language models to training an end-to-end formalizer model from scratch, achieving remarkable advancements. However, existing formalizer still struggles to consistently generate valid statements that meet syntactic validity and semantic consistency. To address this issue, we propose the Autoformalizer with Tool Feedback (ATF), a novel approach that incorporates syntactic and consistency information as tools into the formalization process. By integrating Lean 4 compilers for syntax corrections and employing a multi-LLMs-as-judge approach for consistency validation, the model is able to adaptively refine generated statements according to the tool feedback, enhancing both syntactic validity and semantic consistency. The training of ATF involves a cold-start phase on synthetic tool-calling data, an expert iteration phase to improve formalization capabilities, and Direct Preference Optimization to alleviate ineffective revisions. Experimental results show that ATF markedly outperforms a range of baseline formalizer models, with its superior performance further validated by human evaluations. Subsequent analysis reveals that ATF demonstrates excellent inference scaling properties. Moreover, we open-source Numina-ATF, a dataset containing 750K synthetic formal statements to facilitate advancements in autoformalization and ATP research.

Summary:<br />
Iterative refinement is a promising approach for improving the problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, effectively searching through the vast space of possible refinements poses a significant challenge. The Tree-Guided Policy Refinement (TGPR) framework introduced in this study combines GRPO with a Thompson-Sampling-based tree search to actively explore both failed and successful refinement paths, leading to more adaptive policies. Testing on various benchmarks showed that TGPR outperformed a competitive GRPO baseline, achieving significant improvements in pass rates. By focusing on combining learned policies with structured search methods, TGPR provides a principled approach for enhancing iterative refinement and stateful reasoning in LLMs. <div>

Abstract: Iterative refinement has been a promising paradigm to enable large language models (LLMs) to resolve difficult reasoning and problem-solving tasks. One of the key challenges, however, is how to effectively search through the enormous search space of possible refinements. Existing methods typically fall back on predefined heuristics, which are troubled by the exploration-exploitation dilemma and cannot adapt based on past refinement outcomes. We introduce Tree-Guided Policy Refinement (TGPR), a novel framework that combines GRPO with a Thompson-Sampling-based tree search. TGPR explores both failed and successful refinement paths actively, with denser training trajectories and more adaptive policies. On HumanEval, MBPP, and APPS benchmarks, our method achieves up to +4.2 percentage points absolute improvement in pass@1 (on MBPP) and up to +12.51 percentage points absolute improvement in pass@10 (on APPS) compared to a competitive GRPO baseline. Apart from debugging code, TGPR focuses on a principled approach to combining learned policies with structured search methods, offering a general framework for enhancing iterative refinement and stateful reasoning in LLMs.

Summary:
The article discusses the challenges of modeling agent behaviors using semantic Web standards in the AJAN framework. It focuses on the difficulties in defining agent behaviors in RDF/RDFS and SPARQL, highlighting issues such as handling URIs and complex SPARQL queries. To address these challenges, an integrated development environment is proposed to simplify the modeling process and expand the user community for AJAN. Additionally, the use of Large Language Models is suggested to enhance agent engineering capabilities. By integrating these solutions, the framework aims to facilitate the creation and management of multi-agent systems based on semantic Web standards. <div>
arXiv:2510.06911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are many established semantic Web standards for implementing multi-agent driven applications. The AJAN framework allows to engineer multi-agent systems based on these standards. In particular, agent knowledge is represented in RDF/RDFS and OWL, while agent behavior models are defined with Behavior Trees and SPARQL to access and manipulate this knowledge. However, the appropriate definition of RDF/RDFS and SPARQL-based agent behaviors still remains a major hurdle not only for agent modelers in practice. For example, dealing with URIs is very error-prone regarding typos and dealing with complex SPARQL queries in large-scale environments requires a high learning curve. In this paper, we present an integrated development environment to overcome such hurdles of modeling AJAN agents and at the same time to extend the user community for AJAN by the possibility to leverage Large Language Models for agent engineering.

Summary:<br />
The study examines the Uniform Information Density (UID) hypothesis in the context of large language model (LLM) reasoning traces, focusing on the relationship between step-level uniformity and reasoning quality. A new entropy-based stepwise information density metric is introduced, along with local and global uniformity scores. Experimental results across six reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that higher step-level uniformity correlates with improved accuracy, indicating the practical benefits of maintaining a uniform flow of information during reasoning. Correct reasoning traces exhibit consistent information density, while incorrect traces display irregular spikes. The study shows that uniform information density measures are reliable predictors of reasoning quality, outperforming other internal signals. These findings suggest that ensuring uniformity in information density can enhance the reliability and accuracy of reasoning systems. <div>

Abstract: The Uniform Information Density (UID) hypothesis suggests that effective communication maintains a stable flow of information. In this work, we revisit this principle in the context of large language model (LLM) reasoning traces, asking whether step-level uniformity reflects reasoning quality. To this end, we propose an entropy-based stepwise information density metric and introduce two complementary measures of uniformity, local and global uniformity scores. Across the experiments on six different reasoning benchmarks, we find that step-level uniformity not only provides a strong theoretical lens but also yields practical performance benefits; for example, selecting reasoning traces with more uniform information density at the step-level improves accuracy by 10-32\% relative gains over baselines at AIME2025. Our analysis further reveals that correct reasoning traces tend to avoid sharp information density spikes, while incorrect traces exhibit irregular information bursts. These results demonstrate that UID-inspired information density measures outperform alternative internal signals as predictors of reasoning quality. Results highlight the uniformity of the information density as a robust diagnostic and selection criterion for building more reliable and accurate reasoning systems.

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning framework called Tool-Augmented Policy Optimization (TAPO) that integrates multi-hop reasoning with on-demand tool calling capabilities for large language models. The approach, based on Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization (DAPO), enables models to dynamically combine complex reasoning with tool usage such as search APIs and Python interpreters. Two new datasets, TAPO-easy-60K and TAPO-hard-18K, are introduced to train and evaluate fact-based reasoning and mathematical calculation capabilities. Experimental results on Qwen2.5-3B and Qwen2.5-7B models demonstrate the effectiveness of TAPO in tasks requiring external knowledge and mathematical computation, achieving state-of-the-art performance. TAPO shows more efficient tool utilization compared to baseline methods and avoids excessive tool calls due to reward hacking. This study showcases the potential of integrating advanced reasoning with tool usage to enhance model performance in knowledge-intensive and computationally demanding tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.07038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have popularized test-time scaling, where models generate additional reasoning tokens before producing final answers. These approaches have demonstrated significant performance improvements on benchmarks involving mathematical reasoning. However, language models relying solely on direct inference still struggle with tasks demanding up-to-date knowledge or computational tools such as calculators and code interpreters for complex arithmetic operations. To overcome these limitations, we propose Tool-Augmented Policy Optimization (TAPO), a novel reinforcement learning framework that systematically integrates multi-hop reasoning with adaptive tool-calling capabilities. Our approach employs a modified version of Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization (DAPO), a recently developed RL paradigm, which we adapt specifically for tool invocation scenarios, enabling models to dynamically interleave complex reasoning with on-demand tool usage (including search APIs and Python interpreters).
  To support this research, we introduce two new datasets: TAPO-easy-60K and TAPO-hard-18K, specifically designed to train and evaluate both fact-based reasoning and mathematical calculation capabilities. Our experiments on Qwen2.5-3B and Qwen2.5-7B models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with both models achieving state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring external knowledge and mathematical computation among methods with comparable parameters. Notably, TAPO achieves more efficient tool utilization than baseline methods while preventing excessive calls caused by reward hacking. These results highlight the significant potential of combining advanced reasoning with tool usage to enhance model performance in knowledge-intensive and computationally demanding tasks.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.07064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The difficulty and expense of obtaining large-scale human responses make Large Language Models (LLMs) an attractive alternative and a promising proxy for human behavior. However, prior work shows that LLMs often produce homogeneous outputs that fail to capture the rich diversity of human perspectives and behaviors. Thus, rather than trying to capture this diversity with a single LLM agent, we propose a novel framework to construct a set of agents that collectively capture the diversity of a given human population. Each agent is an LLM whose behavior is steered by conditioning on a small set of human demonstrations (task-response pairs) through in-context learning. The central challenge is therefore to select a representative set of LLM agents from the exponentially large space of possible agents. We tackle this selection problem from the lens of submodular optimization. In particular, we develop methods that offer different trade-offs regarding time complexity and performance guarantees. Extensive experiments in crowdsourcing and educational domains demonstrate that our approach constructs agents that more effectively represent human populations compared to baselines. Moreover, behavioral analyses on new tasks show that these agents reproduce the behavior patterns and perspectives of the students and annotators they are designed to represent.

Abstract: Possibilistic logic programs (poss-programs) under stable models are a major variant of answer set programming (ASP). While its semantics (possibilistic stable models) and properties have been well investigated, the problem of inductive reasoning has not been investigated yet. This paper presents an approach to extracting poss-programs from a background program and examples (parts of intended possibilistic stable models). To this end, the notion of induction tasks is first formally defined, its properties are investigated and two algorithms ilpsm and ilpsmmin for computing induction solutions are presented. An implementation of ilpsmmin is also provided and experimental results show that when inputs are ordinary logic programs, the prototype outperforms a major inductive learning system for normal logic programs from stable models on the datasets that are randomly generated.

Summary:
VRPAgent is a framework that leverages large language models to generate heuristic components for vehicle routing problems (VRPs) and refines them using genetic search. By integrating LLM-generated operators into a metaheuristic framework, VRPAgent is able to outperform handcrafted methods and recent learning-based approaches in solving various VRPs. This approach guarantees correctness and efficiency while enabling the discovery of novel and powerful strategies. Through experiments on different VRPs such as capacitated VRP, VRP with time windows, and prize-collecting VRP, VRPAgent demonstrates superior performance using only a single CPU core. This advancement marks VRPAgent as a groundbreaking LLM-based paradigm that propels the state-of-the-art in VRPs, paving the way for automated heuristics discovery in the future.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.07073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing high-performing heuristics for vehicle routing problems (VRPs) is a complex task that requires both intuition and deep domain knowledge. Large language model (LLM)-based code generation has recently shown promise across many domains, but it still falls short of producing heuristics that rival those crafted by human experts. In this paper, we propose VRPAgent, a framework that integrates LLM-generated components into a metaheuristic and refines them through a novel genetic search. By using the LLM to generate problem-specific operators, embedded within a generic metaheuristic framework, VRPAgent keeps tasks manageable, guarantees correctness, and still enables the discovery of novel and powerful strategies. Across multiple problems, including the capacitated VRP, the VRP with time windows, and the prize-collecting VRP, our method discovers heuristic operators that outperform handcrafted methods and recent learning-based approaches while requiring only a single CPU core.

<div> cognitive bandwidth, action representation, planning with actions, planning with schemas, scalability

Summary:
This paper explores the optimal action representation for long-horizon agents in environments with combinatorially exploded action spaces. It compares conventional planning with actions (PwA) to planning with schemas (PwS), finding an inflection point where PwS becomes more effective than PwA. The study uses ALFWorld and SciWorld as test environments, showing a need for scalable representations around 35 actions for ALFWorld and 500 actions for SciWorld. The location of this inflection point shifts based on model capacities, with stronger planning proficiency pushing it rightward and better schema instantiation pushing it leftward. Despite the suboptimal performance of PwS agents, the paper provides insights on building more capable PwS agents for improved scalable autonomy.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Enabling LLMs to effectively operate long-horizon task which requires long-term planning and multiple interactions is essential for open-world autonomy. Conventional methods adopt planning with actions where a executable action list would be provided as reference. However, this action representation choice would be impractical when the environment action space is combinatorial exploded (e.g., open-ended real world). This naturally leads to a question: As environmental action space scales, what is the optimal action representation for long-horizon agents? In this paper, we systematically study the effectiveness of two different action representations. The first one is conventional planning with actions (PwA) which is predominantly adopted for its effectiveness on existing benchmarks. The other one is planning with schemas (PwS) which instantiate an action schema into action lists (e.g., "move [OBJ] to [OBJ]" -> "move apple to desk") to ensure concise action space and reliable scalability. This alternative is motivated by its alignment with human cognition and its compliance with environment-imposed action format restriction. We propose cognitive bandwidth perspective as a conceptual framework to qualitatively understand the differences between these two action representations and empirically observe a representation-choice inflection point between ALFWorld (~35 actions) and SciWorld (~500 actions), which serve as evidence of the need for scalable representations. We further conduct controlled experiments to study how the location of this inflection point interacts with different model capacities: stronger planning proficiency shifts the inflection rightward, whereas better schema instantiation shifts it leftward. Finally, noting the suboptimal performance of PwS agents, we provide an actionable guide for building more capable PwS agents for better scalable autonomy.

<div> Keywords: physical embodiment, existentialism, reinforcement learning, intrinsic drive, care

Summary:
Physical vulnerability and mortality are typically viewed as challenges for artificial agents but are easily managed by biological organisms in open-ended environments. Inspired by Heidegger's phenomenology, the authors propose two minimal conditions for physical embodiment: being-in-the-world and being-towards-death. These conditions give rise to a homeostatic drive and an intrinsic drive to maximize control over future states, akin to Nietzsche's will-to-power. By formalizing these concepts in a reinforcement learning framework, the study explores how intrinsically driven embodied agents can learn in multi-agent environments to cultivate capacities for open-endedness and care. This approach aims to develop more adaptive and caring artificial agents that can navigate complex environments effectively. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.07117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical vulnerability and mortality are often seen as obstacles to be avoided in the development of artificial agents, which struggle to adapt to open-ended environments and provide aligned care. Meanwhile, biological organisms survive, thrive, and care for each other in an open-ended physical world with relative ease and efficiency. Understanding the role of the conditions of life in this disparity can aid in developing more robust, adaptive, and caring artificial agents. Here we define two minimal conditions for physical embodiment inspired by the existentialist phenomenology of Martin Heidegger: being-in-the-world (the agent is a part of the environment) and being-towards-death (unless counteracted, the agent drifts toward terminal states due to the second law of thermodynamics). We propose that from these conditions we can obtain both a homeostatic drive - aimed at maintaining integrity and avoiding death by expending energy to learn and act - and an intrinsic drive to continue to do so in as many ways as possible. Drawing inspiration from Friedrich Nietzsche's existentialist concept of will-to-power, we examine how intrinsic drives to maximize control over future states, e.g., empowerment, allow agents to increase the probability that they will be able to meet their future homeostatic needs, thereby enhancing their capacity to maintain physical integrity. We formalize these concepts within a reinforcement learning framework, which enables us to examine how intrinsically driven embodied agents learning in open-ended multi-agent environments may cultivate the capacities for open-endedness and care.ov

<div> Keywords: Process discovery, event logs, domain knowledge, Large Language Models, interactive framework

Summary:<br />
- Process discovery aims to derive process models from event logs but may lack reliability without incorporating domain knowledge.
- An interactive framework is proposed that uses Large Language Models to extract declarative rules from natural language descriptions provided by domain experts.
- The extracted rules guide the process discovery algorithm, combining insights from event logs and domain knowledge to avoid problematic process structures.
- The framework coordinates interactions among the LLM, domain experts, and backend services to improve the accuracy of discovered process models.
- The fully implemented tool supporting this workflow was evaluated through an empirical study involving real-life event logs and domain experts assessing usability and effectiveness.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.07161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Process discovery aims to derive process models from event logs, providing insights into operational behavior and forming a foundation for conformance checking and process improvement. However, models derived solely from event data may not accurately reflect the real process, as event logs are often incomplete or affected by noise, and domain knowledge, an important complementary resource, is typically disregarded. As a result, the discovered models may lack reliability for downstream tasks. We propose an interactive framework that incorporates domain knowledge, expressed in natural language, into the process discovery pipeline using Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach leverages LLMs to extract declarative rules from textual descriptions provided by domain experts. These rules are used to guide the IMr discovery algorithm, which recursively constructs process models by combining insights from both the event log and the extracted rules, helping to avoid problematic process structures that contradict domain knowledge. The framework coordinates interactions among the LLM, domain experts, and a set of backend services. We present a fully implemented tool that supports this workflow and conduct an extensive evaluation of multiple LLMs and prompt engineering strategies. Our empirical study includes a case study based on a real-life event log with the involvement of domain experts, who assessed the usability and effectiveness of the framework.

<div> Keywords: large language models, scientific law discovery, NewtonBench, interactive model discovery, AI agents

Summary:
NewtonBench introduces a new benchmark for scientific law discovery using large language models (LLMs), addressing the trilemma of scientific relevance, scalability, and resistance to memorization. The benchmark includes 324 tasks across 12 physics domains and emphasizes interactive model exploration rather than static function fitting. Experiment results show that while LLMs demonstrate a capacity for discovery, this ability weakens with increasing system complexity and is sensitive to observational noise. Surprisingly, providing code interpreters to assist models can hinder discovery by promoting premature exploitation over exploration. The study highlights the challenge of achieving robust and generalizable discovery in interactive environments. NewtonBench serves as a valuable tool for measuring progress in AI-driven scientific discovery and guiding the development of future AI agents capable of authentic scientific exploration. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.07172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are emerging as powerful tools for scientific law discovery, a foundational challenge in AI-driven science. However, existing benchmarks for this task suffer from a fundamental methodological trilemma, forcing a trade-off between scientific relevance, scalability, and resistance to memorization. Furthermore, they oversimplify discovery as static function fitting, failing to capture the authentic scientific process of uncovering embedded laws through the interactive exploration of complex model systems. To address these critical gaps, we introduce NewtonBench, a benchmark comprising 324 scientific law discovery tasks across 12 physics domains. Our design mitigates the evaluation trilemma by using metaphysical shifts - systematic alterations of canonical laws - to generate a vast suite of problems that are scalable, scientifically relevant, and memorization-resistant. Moreover, we elevate the evaluation from static function fitting to interactive model discovery, requiring agents to experimentally probe simulated complex systems to uncover hidden principles. Our extensive experiment reveals a clear but fragile capability for discovery in frontier LLMs: this ability degrades precipitously with increasing system complexity and exhibits extreme sensitivity to observational noise. Notably, we uncover a paradoxical effect of tool assistance: providing a code interpreter can hinder more capable models by inducing a premature shift from exploration to exploitation, causing them to satisfice on suboptimal solutions. These results demonstrate that robust, generalizable discovery in complex, interactive environments remains the core challenge. By providing a scalable, robust, and scientifically authentic testbed, NewtonBench offers a crucial tool for measuring true progress and guiding the development of next-generation AI agents capable of genuine scientific discovery.

<div> Algorithm, Multi-objective, Coordination, Path finding, Optimization

Summary: 
The article proposes a lexicographic framework for multi-objective multi-agent path finding (MO-MAPF), introducing the Lexicographic Conflict-Based Search (LCBS) algorithm to efficiently compute solutions aligned with user-defined preferences. LCBS integrates priority-aware A* search and conflict-based search to avoid the construction of Pareto frontiers and produce optimal solutions while scaling to instances with up to ten objectives. The algorithm demonstrates higher success rates against existing methods on standard and randomized MAPF benchmarks, particularly as the number of objectives increases. LCBS is capable of efficiently balancing multiple potentially competing objectives in shared environments, offering a novel approach to optimizing coordination among multiple agents. <div>

Abstract: Many real-world scenarios require multiple agents to coordinate in shared environments, while balancing trade-offs between multiple, potentially competing objectives. Current multi-objective multi-agent path finding (MO-MAPF) algorithms typically produce conflict-free plans by computing Pareto frontiers. They do not explicitly optimize for user-defined preferences, even when the preferences are available, and scale poorly with the number of objectives. We propose a lexicographic framework for modeling MO-MAPF, along with an algorithm \textit{Lexicographic Conflict-Based Search} (LCBS) that directly computes a single solution aligned with a lexicographic preference over objectives. LCBS integrates a priority-aware low-level $A^*$ search with conflict-based search, avoiding Pareto frontier construction and enabling efficient planning guided by preference over objectives. We provide insights into optimality and scalability, and empirically demonstrate that LCBS computes optimal solutions while scaling to instances with up to ten objectives -- far beyond the limits of existing MO-MAPF methods. Evaluations on standard and randomized MAPF benchmarks show consistently higher success rates against state-of-the-art baselines, especially with increasing number of objectives.

Abstract: Generative AI has unlocked new possibilities in content discovery and management. Through collaboration with the National Football League (NFL), we demonstrate how a generative-AI based workflow enables media researchers and analysts to query relevant historical plays using natural language rather than traditional filter-and-click interfaces. The agentic workflow takes a user query as input, breaks it into elements, and translates them into the underlying database query language. Accuracy and latency are further improved through carefully designed semantic caching. The solution achieves over 95 percent accuracy and reduces the average time to find relevant videos from 10 minutes to 30 seconds, significantly increasing the NFL's operational efficiency and allowing users to focus on producing creative content and engaging storylines.

Summary:
This work focuses on telemanipulation of plastic pipettes, addressing the challenge of dynamic object shape changes. A telemanipulation system using a multi-contact haptic device and tactile sensors in a Robotiq gripper is proposed. A novel approach utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is introduced to detect tilt and position of deformable objects while grasping them. The CNN generates a mask based on this data to provide additional tactile stimuli to users during telemanipulation. Results show that using the CNN algorithm and the preset mask significantly improves tilt and position recognition by users, increasing from 9.67% to 82.5%. This study highlights the potential of advanced technologies such as CNNs in enhancing the precision and dexterity of telemanipulation systems for deformable objects.

Abstract: Telemanipulation of deformable objects requires high precision and dexterity from the users, which can be increased by kinesthetic and tactile feedback. However, the object shape can change dynamically, causing ambiguous perception of its alignment and hence errors in the robot positioning. Therefore, the tilt angle and position classification problem has to be solved to present a clear tactile pattern to the user. This work presents a telemanipulation system for plastic pipettes consisting of a multi-contact haptic device LinkGlide to deliver haptic feedback at the users' palm and two tactile sensors array embedded in the 2-finger Robotiq gripper. We propose a novel approach based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect the tilt and position while grasping deformable objects. The CNN generates a mask based on recognized tilt and position data to render further multi-contact tactile stimuli provided to the user during the telemanipulation. The study has shown that using the CNN algorithm and the preset mask, tilt, and position recognition by users is increased from 9.67% using the direct data to 82.5%.

Summary:
Deformable objects can pose challenges for robotic grippers during grasping, leading to errors in alignment and positioning. To improve precision in telemanipulation tasks, clear tactile patterns are essential for haptic feedback. This study introduces a telemanipulation system for plastic pipettes, utilizing a haptic interface with electro-stimulation arrays and tactile sensors in a Robotiq gripper. A novel approach employing convolutional neural networks (CNN) is proposed to detect object tilt and generate corresponding tactile patterns for feedback. Results show that CNN-based tilt recognition improved user accuracy and success rates during teleoperation significantly. From a low initial tilt recognition rate of 23.13%, the CNN algorithm boosted it to 57.9%, while the success rate in teleoperation increased from 53.12% to 92.18% with the generated tactile patterns. This approach demonstrates the potential of CNN algorithms in enhancing tactile feedback and improving robotic telemanipulation tasks involving deformable objects.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The shape of deformable objects can change drastically during grasping by robotic grippers, causing an ambiguous perception of their alignment and hence resulting in errors in robot positioning and telemanipulation. Rendering clear tactile patterns is fundamental to increasing users' precision and dexterity through tactile haptic feedback during telemanipulation. Therefore, different methods have to be studied to decode the sensors' data into haptic stimuli. This work presents a telemanipulation system for plastic pipettes that consists of a Force Dimension Omega.7 haptic interface endowed with two electro-stimulation arrays and two tactile sensor arrays embedded in the 2-finger Robotiq gripper. We propose a novel approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) to detect the tilt of deformable objects. The CNN generates a tactile pattern based on recognized tilt data to render further electro-tactile stimuli provided to the user during the telemanipulation. The study has shown that using the CNN algorithm, tilt recognition by users increased from 23.13\% with the downsized data to 57.9%, and the success rate during teleoperation increased from 53.12% using the downsized data to 92.18% using the tactile patterns generated by the CNN.

Abstract: Interface agents powered by generative AI models (referred to as "agents") can automate actions based on user commands. An important aspect of developing agents is their user experience (i.e., agent experience). There is a growing need to provide scaffolds for a broader set of individuals beyond AI engineers to prototype agent experiences, since they can contribute valuable perspectives to designing agent experiences. In this work, we explore the affordances agent prototyping systems should offer by conducting a requirements elicitation study with 12 participants with varying experience with agents. We identify key activities in agent experience prototyping and the desired capabilities of agent prototyping systems. We instantiate those capabilities in the AgentBuilder design probe for agent prototyping. We conduct an in situ agent prototyping study with 14 participants using AgentBuilder to validate the design requirements and elicit insights on how developers prototype agents and what their needs are in this process.

Summary: <br />
WeatherArchive-Bench introduces the first benchmark for evaluating retrieval-augmented generation systems on historical weather archives. It consists of two tasks: WeatherArchive-Retrieval assesses a system's capability to find historically relevant passages from over one million archival news segments, while WeatherArchive-Assessment evaluates Large Language Models' ability to classify societal vulnerability and resilience indicators from extreme weather narratives. Experiments show that dense retrievers struggle with historical terminology, and LLMs often misinterpret vulnerability and resilience concepts. These findings highlight limitations in reasoning about complex societal indicators and offer insights for designing more robust climate-focused RAG systems from archival contexts. The dataset and evaluation framework are publicly available for further research. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Historical archives on weather events are collections of enduring primary source records that offer rich, untapped narratives of how societies have experienced and responded to extreme weather events. These qualitative accounts provide insights into societal vulnerability and resilience that are largely absent from meteorological records, making them valuable for climate scientists to understand societal responses. However, their vast scale, noisy digitized quality, and archaic language make it difficult to transform them into structured knowledge for climate research. To address this challenge, we introduce WeatherArchive-Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems on historical weather archives. WeatherArchive-Bench comprises two tasks: WeatherArchive-Retrieval, which measures a system's ability to locate historically relevant passages from over one million archival news segments, and WeatherArchive-Assessment, which evaluates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can classify societal vulnerability and resilience indicators from extreme weather narratives. Extensive experiments across sparse, dense, and re-ranking retrievers, as well as a diverse set of LLMs, reveal that dense retrievers often fail on historical terminology, while LLMs frequently misinterpret vulnerability and resilience concepts. These findings highlight key limitations in reasoning about complex societal indicators and provide insights for designing more robust climate-focused RAG systems from archival contexts. The constructed dataset and evaluation framework are publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/WeatherArchive-Bench/.

Summary:
The article discusses the integration of large language models (LLMs) and real-time speech recognition with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to enable issuing GUI actions through natural language. The proposed architecture utilizes the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to make an application's navigation graph and semantics accessible. The ViewModel, following the MVVM pattern, exposes application capabilities to the speech-enabled assistant, ensuring alignment between spoken input and the visual interface. This architecture enables full voice accessibility and consistent feedback across modalities, preparing apps for future OS super assistants. The article also evaluates the use of locally deployable, open-weight LLMs for speech-enabled multimodal UIs, highlighting their performance comparability with proprietary models and the hardware requirements for fast responsiveness. Overall, the study emphasizes the importance of integrating LLMs with GUIs for enhanced user experience and accessibility. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) and real-time speech recognition now make it possible to issue any graphical user interface (GUI) action through natural language and receive the corresponding system response directly through the GUI. Most production applications were never designed with speech in mind. This article provides a concrete architecture that enables GUIs to interface with LLM-based speech-enabled assistants.
  The architecture makes an application's navigation graph and semantics available through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The ViewModel, part of the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern, exposes the application's capabilities to the assistant by supplying both tools applicable to a currently visible view and application-global tools extracted from the GUI tree router. This architecture facilitates full voice accessibility while ensuring reliable alignment between spoken input and the visual interface, accompanied by consistent feedback across modalities. It future-proofs apps for upcoming OS super assistants that employ computer use agents (CUAs) and natively consume MCP if an application provides it.
  To address concerns about privacy and data security, the practical effectiveness of locally deployable, open-weight LLMs for speech-enabled multimodal UIs is evaluated. Findings suggest that recent smaller open-weight models approach the performance of leading proprietary models in overall accuracy and require enterprise-grade hardware for fast responsiveness.

The study explores how early adopters at Microsoft perceive multi-agent generative AI tools, viewing them as specialized agents working in teams with roles like assistants or reviewers. These tools range from AI-dominant to AI-assisted interactions, modeled after human collaboration dynamics. Challenges identified include error propagation and the need for clear communication to address transparency issues such as error tracing and prevention of misuse. Transparency is seen as crucial for building trust and oversight in human-agent and agent-agent interactions. Design considerations highlighted in the study contribute to understanding collaborative mechanisms in AI tools and suggest future research directions for optimizing inter-agent and human mediation interactions in innovative workflows.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: With recent advancements in multi-agent generative AI (Gen AI), technology organizations like Microsoft are adopting these complex tools, redefining AI agents as active collaborators in complex workflows rather than as passive tools. In this study, we investigated how early adopters and developers conceptualize multi-agent Gen AI tools, focusing on how they understand human-AI collaboration mechanisms, general collaboration dynamics, and transparency in the context of AI tools. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 13 developers, all early adopters of multi-agent Gen AI technology who work at Microsoft. Our findings revealed that these early adopters conceptualize multi-agent systems as "teams" of specialized role-based and task-based agents, such as assistants or reviewers, structured similar to human collaboration models and ranging from AI-dominant to AI-assisted, user-controlled interactions. We identified key challenges, including error propagation, unpredictable and unproductive agent loop behavior, and the need for clear communication to mitigate the layered transparency issues. Early adopters' perspectives about the role of transparency underscored its importance as a way to build trust, verify and trace errors, and prevent misuse, errors, and leaks. The insights and design considerations we present contribute to CSCW research about collaborative mechanisms with capabilities ranging from AI-dominant to AI-assisted interactions, transparency and oversight strategies in human-agent and agent-agent interactions, and how humans make sense of these multi-agent systems as dynamic, role-diverse collaborators which are customizable for diverse needs and workflows. We conclude with future research directions that extend CSCW approaches to the design of inter-agent and human mediation interactions.

A new modular, object-oriented framework has been developed to improve multi-agent social interaction simulations using Large Language Models. The framework integrates various base classes through a hierarchical structure, promoting scalability and reusability. A memory summarization mechanism filters and distills relevant information from raw data to prioritize contextually salient events and interactions. By selecting and combining derived classes, specific simulated environments can be customized. The framework has been utilized successfully to simulate human interactions on social media, replicating real-world online social behaviors.

Abstract: Multi-agent social interaction has clearly benefited from Large Language Models. However, current simulation systems still face challenges such as difficulties in scaling to diverse scenarios and poor reusability due to a lack of modular design. To address these issues, we designed and developed a modular, object-oriented framework that organically integrates various base classes through a hierarchical structure, harvesting scalability and reusability. We inherited the framework to realize common derived classes. Additionally, a memory summarization mechanism is proposed to filter and distill relevant information from raw memory data, prioritizing contextually salient events and interactions. By selecting and combining some necessary derived classes, we customized a specific simulated environment. Utilizing this simulated environment, we successfully simulated human interactions on social media, replicating real-world online social behaviors. The source code for the project will be released and evolve.

<div> Keywords: surface landmines, unexploded ordnances, deep learning, uncertainty quantification, Monte Carlo Dropout

Summary:
Surface landmine and unexploded ordnances (UXOs) detection using deep learning faces challenges in noisy conditions and adversarial attacks. The study proposes incorporating Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout into a fine-tuned ResNet-50 model for classification, aiming to quantify uncertainty in predictions. By assessing epistemic uncertainty, the model can provide additional reliability metrics for decision-making in demining operations. Experimental results on various test images confirm the model's capability to identify unreliable predictions under adverse conditions. This proof-of-concept study underscores the necessity for uncertainty quantification in demining efforts and sheds light on the vulnerability of current neural networks to adversarial threats. It emphasizes the crucial need to enhance the robustness and reliability of models for practical demining applications.

Abstract: Detecting surface landmines and unexploded ordnances (UXOs) using deep learning has shown promise in humanitarian demining. However, deterministic neural networks can be vulnerable to noisy conditions and adversarial attacks, leading to missed detection or misclassification. This study introduces the idea of uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout, integrated into a fine-tuned ResNet-50 architecture for surface landmine and UXO classification, which was tested on a simulated dataset. Integrating the MC Dropout approach helps quantify epistemic uncertainty, providing an additional metric for prediction reliability, which could be helpful to make more informed decisions in demining operations. Experimental results on clean, adversarially perturbed, and noisy test images demonstrate the model's ability to flag unreliable predictions under challenging conditions. This proof-of-concept study highlights the need for uncertainty quantification in demining, raises awareness about the vulnerability of existing neural networks in demining to adversarial threats, and emphasizes the importance of developing more robust and reliable models for practical applications.

<div> Keywords: Industrial question-answering, Multi-agent system, Knowledge graph, Distillation, Reliability

Summary: 
Industrial question-answering systems must ensure high safety and reliability, especially in critical scenarios such as equipment fault diagnosis. Existing multi-agent models enhance reasoning depth but face challenges like unverifiable outputs. In response, Knowledge Graph-guided Multi-Agent System Distillation (KG-MASD) is proposed, using a knowledge graph as a structured prior to improve state representation and convergence. This approach formulates distillation as a Markov Decision Process, enabling the transfer of collaborative reasoning capabilities to lightweight student models. KG-MASD integrates collaborative reasoning with knowledge grounding, leading to enhanced accuracy and reliability in industrial QA tasks. Experimental results show significant improvements over baselines, with higher accuracy and trustworthy AI deployment in safety-critical contexts.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Industrial question-answering (QA) systems require higher safety and reliability than general-purpose dialogue models, as errors in high-risk scenarios such as equipment fault diagnosis can have severe consequences. Although multi-agent large language models enhance reasoning depth, they suffer from uncontrolled iterations and unverifiable outputs, and conventional distillation methods struggle to transfer collaborative reasoning capabilities to lightweight, deployable student models. To address these challenges, we propose Knowledge Graph-guided Multi-Agent System Distillation (KG-MASD). Our approach formulates distillation as a Markov Decision Process and incorporates a knowledge graph as a verifiable structured prior to enrich state representation and ensure convergence. By integrating collaborative reasoning with knowledge grounding, KG-MASD generates high-confidence instruction-tuning data and jointly distills reasoning depth and verifiability into compact student models suitable for edge deployment. Experiments on an industrial QA dataset show that KG-MASD improves accuracy by 2.4 per cent to 20.1 per cent over baselines and significantly enhances reliability, enabling trustworthy AI deployment in safety-critical industrial scenarios. Code and data are available at https://github.com/erwinmsmith/KG-MAD/.

Abstract: Open-ended survey responses provide valuable insights in marketing research, but low-quality responses not only burden researchers with manual filtering but also risk leading to misleading conclusions, underscoring the need for effective evaluation. Existing automatic evaluation methods target LLM-generated text and inadequately assess human-written responses with their distinct characteristics. To address such characteristics, we propose a two-stage evaluation framework specifically designed for human survey responses. First, gibberish filtering removes nonsensical responses. Then, three dimensions-effort, relevance, and completeness-are evaluated using LLM capabilities, grounded in empirical analysis of real-world survey data. Validation on English and Korean datasets shows that our framework not only outperforms existing metrics but also demonstrates high practical applicability for real-world applications such as response quality prediction and response rejection, showing strong correlations with expert assessment.

Summary:
Referring Expression Comprehension and Segmentation are crucial tasks in evaluating the abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). A new strategy called CoT Referring is proposed to improve model reasoning across modalities by structuring training data in a chain-of-thought format. This approach enhances accuracy in complex query scenarios by parsing textual structures into sequential referring steps, identifying relationships, and ensuring consistent reference alignment. The training data is restructured to enforce a new output form, and a benchmark is created for evaluating complex referring cases. Additionally, detection and segmentation capabilities are integrated into a unified MLLM framework, trained with an adaptive weighted loss to optimize performance. Experimental results show a significant increase in accuracy over baseline models, with a notable improvement of 2.5%+.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension and Segmentation are critical tasks for assessing the integration of language understanding and image comprehension, serving as benchmarks for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a new strategy, CoT Referring, which enhances model reasoning across modalities through a structured, chain-of-thought training data structure. Our approach systematically parses textual structures to a sequential referring step, where in each step it identifies relationships and ensures consistent reference alignment, thereby improving accuracy in complex query scenarios. We restructure the training data to enforce a new output form, providing new annotations for existing datasets and compiling an evaluation benchmark from existing resources. This benchmark is designed explicitly for complex referring cases. We also integrate detection and segmentation capabilities into a unified MLLM framework, training it with a novel adaptive weighted loss to optimize performance. Experimental results on our curated benchmark and RefCOCO/+/g demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with a notable increase of 2.5%+ over baseline models.

<div> word representation algorithm, domain specific data, transformer architecture, tokenization method, scientific domain

Summary:
An optimal word representation algorithm is crucial for domain-specific data due to varying meanings of words based on context. Generative AI and transformer models excel in generating contextualized embeddings but are resource-intensive. This study focuses on identifying the best word representation and tokenization methods for the scientific domain. The research aims to find methods suitable for downstream NLP tasks in science and develop an evaluation suite for ongoing algorithm assessments. By creating a comprehensive evaluation suite comprising diverse scientific tasks and datasets, the study evaluates multiple word representation and tokenization algorithms. The goal is to determine the most effective techniques for scientific NLP tasks and provide a platform for continuous evaluation and comparison of new algorithms in this domain.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding an optimal word representation algorithm is particularly important in terms of domain specific data, as the same word can have different meanings and hence, different representations depending on the domain and context. While Generative AI and transformer architecture does a great job at generating contextualized embeddings for any given work, they are quite time and compute extensive, especially if we were to pre-train such a model from scratch. In this work, we focus on the scientific domain and finding the optimal word representation algorithm along with the tokenization method that could be used to represent words in the scientific domain. The goal of this research is two fold: 1) finding the optimal word representation and tokenization methods that can be used in downstream scientific domain NLP tasks, and 2) building a comprehensive evaluation suite that could be used to evaluate various word representation and tokenization algorithms (even as new ones are introduced) in the scientific domain. To this end, we build an evaluation suite consisting of several downstream tasks and relevant datasets for each task. Furthermore, we use the constructed evaluation suite to test various word representation and tokenization algorithms.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new community-centered model for generating evolving community structures in graphs. This model allows for customizable changes such as community growth, shrinkage, merging, splitting, appearing, and disappearing. It also generates a temporal network where nodes can appear, disappear, or change community memberships. The benchmark aims to address the lack of real-world community evolution tracking in existing benchmarks. Three methods were tested using this benchmark to measure their performance in tracking node cluster membership and detecting community evolution. The article provides Python libraries, drawing utilities, and validation metrics to compare algorithm results with ground truth for dynamic community detection. Overall, the proposed model offers a comprehensive approach to evaluating community detection algorithms in the context of evolving networks. <div>

Abstract: Graph models help understand network dynamics and evolution. Creating graphs with controlled topology and embedded partitions is a common strategy for evaluating community detection algorithms. However, existing benchmarks often overlook the need to track the evolution of communities in real-world networks. To address this, a new community-centered model is proposed to generate customizable evolving community structures where communities can grow, shrink, merge, split, appear or disappear. This benchmark also generates the underlying temporal network, where nodes can appear, disappear, or move between communities. The benchmark has been used to test three methods, measuring their performance in tracking nodes' cluster membership and detecting community evolution. Python libraries, drawing utilities, and validation metrics are provided to compare ground truth with algorithm results for detecting dynamic communities.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal Models, Low-Resource Languages, Translation Quality, Centered Kernel Alignment, REPINA

Summary: 
The study focuses on improving translation quality from low-resource languages (LRLs) to high-resource languages (HRL) through a joint method called TRepLiNa. By aligning mid-level layers using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and REPINA, the researchers explored zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings using a large language model (LLM) across different language pairs. The results indicated that TRepLiNa is an effective and practical approach to enhancing LRL translation, especially in data-scarce contexts. This research contributes to addressing linguistic gaps in India, specifically for LRLs such as Mundari, Santali, and Bhili, by leveraging the similarities between languages within the decoder of the LLM. The findings highlight the potential of enforcing cross-lingual similarity in specific layers to improve translation quality in diverse and low-resource language settings.

Abstract: The 2025 Multimodal Models for Low-Resource Contexts and Social Impact (MMLoSo) Language Challenge addresses one of India's most pressing linguistic gaps: the lack of resources for its diverse low-resource languages (LRLs). In this study, we investigate whether enforcing cross-lingual similarity in specific internal layers of a decoder-only multilingual large language model (LLM) can improve translation quality from LRL to high-resource language (HRL). Specifically, we combine Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), a similarity metric that encourages representations of different languages to align, with REPINA, a regularization method that constrains parameter updates to remain close to the pretrained model, into a joint method we call TRepLiNa. In this research project, we experiment with zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings using Aya-23 8B with QLoRA across MMLoSo shared task language pairs (Mundari, Santali, Bhili) with Hindi/English pivots. Our results show that aligning mid-level layers using TRepLiNa (CKA+REPINA) is a low-cost, practical approach to improving LRL translation, especially in data-scarce settings.

Abstract: As online education platforms continue to expand, there is a growing need for assessment methods that not only measure answer accuracy but also capture the depth of students' cognitive processes in alignment with curriculum objectives. This study proposes and evaluates a rubric-based assessment framework powered by a large language model (LLM) for measuring algebraic competence, real-world-context block coding tasks. The problem set, designed by mathematics education experts, aligns each problem segment with five predefined rubric dimensions, enabling the LLM to assess both correctness and quality of students' problem-solving processes. The system was implemented on an online platform that records all intermediate responses and employs the LLM for rubric-aligned achievement evaluation. To examine the practical effectiveness of the proposed framework, we conducted a field study involving 42 middle school students engaged in multi-stage quadratic equation tasks with block coding. The study integrated learner self-assessments and expert ratings to benchmark the system's outputs. The LLM-based rubric evaluation showed strong agreement with expert judgments and consistently produced rubric-aligned, process-oriented feedback. These results demonstrate both the validity and scalability of incorporating LLM-driven rubric assessment into online mathematics and STEM education platforms.

Abstract: Cutaneous malignancies demand early detection for favorable outcomes, yet current diagnostics suffer from inter-observer variability and access disparities. While AI shows promise, existing dermatological systems are limited by homogeneous architectures, dataset biases across skin tones, and fragmented approaches that treat natural language processing as separate post-hoc explanations rather than integral to clinical decision-making. We introduce a unified framework that fundamentally reimagines AI integration for dermatological diagnostics through two synergistic innovations. First, a purposefully heterogeneous ensemble of architecturally diverse convolutional neural networks provides complementary diagnostic perspectives, with an intrinsic uncertainty mechanism flagging discordant cases for specialist review -- mimicking clinical best practices. Second, we embed large language model capabilities directly into the diagnostic workflow, transforming classification outputs into clinically meaningful assessments that simultaneously fulfill medical documentation requirements and deliver patient-centered education. This seamless integration generates structured reports featuring precise lesion characterization, accessible diagnostic reasoning, and actionable monitoring guidance -- empowering patients to recognize early warning signs between visits. By addressing both diagnostic reliability and communication barriers within a single cohesive system, our approach bridges the critical translational gap that has prevented previous AI implementations from achieving clinical impact. The framework represents a significant advancement toward deployable dermatological AI that enhances diagnostic precision while actively supporting the continuum of care from initial detection through patient education, ultimately improving early intervention rates for skin lesions.

Abstract: This dataset provides responses to a standardized, bilingual (English-Hindi) Prakriti Assessment Questionnaire designed to evaluate the physical, physiological, and psychological characteristics of individuals according to classical Ayurvedic principles. The questionnaire consists of 24 multiple-choice items covering body features, appetite, sleep patterns, energy levels, and temperament. It was developed following AYUSH/CCRAS guidelines to ensure comprehensive and accurate data collection. All questions are mandatory and neutrally phrased to minimize bias, and dosha labels (Vata, Pitta, Kapha) are hidden from participants. Data were collected via a Google Forms deployment, enabling automated scoring of responses to map individual traits to dosha-specific scores. The resulting dataset provides a structured platform for research in computational intelligence, Ayurvedic studies, and personalized health analytics, supporting analysis of trait distributions, correlations, and predictive modeling. It can also serve as a reference for future Prakriti-based studies and the development of intelligent health applications.

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) contain extensive unstructured clinical data that can overwhelm emergency physicians trying to identify critical information. We present a two-stage summarization system that runs entirely on embedded devices, enabling offline clinical summarization while preserving patient privacy. In our approach, a dual-device architecture first retrieves relevant patient record sections using the Jetson Nano-R (Retrieve), then generates a structured summary on another Jetson Nano-S (Summarize), communicating via a lightweight socket link. The summarization output is two-fold: (1) a fixed-format list of critical findings, and (2) a context-specific narrative focused on the clinician's query. The retrieval stage uses locally stored EHRs, splits long notes into semantically coherent sections, and searches for the most relevant sections per query. The generation stage uses a locally hosted small language model (SLM) to produce the summary from the retrieved text, operating within the constraints of two NVIDIA Jetson devices. We first benchmarked six open-source SLMs under 7B parameters to identify viable models. We incorporated an LLM-as-Judge evaluation mechanism to assess summary quality in terms of factual accuracy, completeness, and clarity. Preliminary results on MIMIC-IV and de-identified real EHRs demonstrate that our fully offline system can effectively produce useful summaries in under 30 seconds.

Abstract: There is no doubt that there has been a drastic increase in abusive and sexually explicit content in music, particularly in Billboard Music Charts. However, there is a lack of studies that validate the trend for effective policy development, as such content has harmful behavioural changes in children and youths. In this study, we utilise deep learning methods to analyse songs (lyrics) from Billboard Charts of the United States in the last seven decades. We provide a longitudinal study using deep learning and language models and review the evolution of content using sentiment analysis and abuse detection, including sexually explicit content. Our results show a significant rise in explicit content in popular music from 1990 onwards. Furthermore, we find an increasing prevalence of songs with lyrics containing profane, sexually explicit, and otherwise inappropriate language. The longitudinal analysis of the ability of language models to capture nuanced patterns in lyrical content, reflecting shifts in societal norms and language use over time.

Abstract: We propose RareGraph-Synth, a knowledge-guided, continuous-time diffusion framework that generates realistic yet privacy-preserving synthetic electronic-health-record (EHR) trajectories for ultra-rare diseases. RareGraph-Synth unifies five public resources: Orphanet/Orphadata, the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), the GARD rare-disease KG, PrimeKG, and the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) into a heterogeneous knowledge graph comprising approximately 8 M typed edges. Meta-path scores extracted from this 8-million-edge KG modulate the per-token noise schedule in the forward stochastic differential equation, steering generation toward biologically plausible lab-medication-adverse-event co-occurrences while retaining score-based diffusion model stability. The reverse denoiser then produces timestamped sequences of lab-code, medication-code, and adverse-event-flag triples that contain no protected health information. On simulated ultra-rare-disease cohorts, RareGraph-Synth lowers categorical Maximum Mean Discrepancy by 40 percent relative to an unguided diffusion baseline and by greater than 60 percent versus GAN counterparts, without sacrificing downstream predictive utility. A black-box membership-inference evaluation using the DOMIAS attacker yields AUROC approximately 0.53, well below the 0.55 safe-release threshold and substantially better than the approximately 0.61 plus or minus 0.03 observed for non-KG baselines, demonstrating strong resistance to re-identification. These results suggest that integrating biomedical knowledge graphs directly into diffusion noise schedules can simultaneously enhance fidelity and privacy, enabling safer data sharing for rare-disease research.

Abstract: Multi-objective discrete optimization problems, such as molecular design, pose significant challenges due to their vast and unstructured combinatorial spaces. Traditional evolutionary algorithms often get trapped in local optima, while expert knowledge can provide crucial guidance for accelerating convergence. Large language models (LLMs) offer powerful priors and reasoning ability, making them natural optimizers when expert knowledge matters. However, closed-source LLMs, though strong in exploration, cannot update their parameters and thus cannot internalize experience. Conversely, smaller open models can be continually fine-tuned but lack broad knowledge and reasoning strength. We introduce Multi-LLM Collaborative Co-evolution (MCCE), a hybrid framework that unites a frozen closed-source LLM with a lightweight trainable model. The system maintains a trajectory memory of past search processes; the small model is progressively refined via reinforcement learning, with the two models jointly supporting and complementing each other in global exploration. Unlike model distillation, this process enhances the capabilities of both models through mutual inspiration. Experiments on multi-objective drug design benchmarks show that MCCE achieves state-of-the-art Pareto front quality and consistently outperforms baselines. These results highlight a new paradigm for enabling continual evolution in hybrid LLM systems, combining knowledge-driven exploration with experience-driven learning.

Abstract: In this study, we reproduced the work done in the paper "XRec: Large Language Models for Explainable Recommendation" by Ma et al. (2024). The original authors introduced XRec, a model-agnostic collaborative instruction-tuning framework that enables large language models (LLMs) to provide users with comprehensive explanations of generated recommendations. Our objective was to replicate the results of the original paper, albeit using Llama 3 as the LLM for evaluation instead of GPT-3.5-turbo. We built on the source code provided by Ma et al. (2024) to achieve our goal. Our work extends the original paper by modifying the input embeddings or deleting the output embeddings of XRec's Mixture of Experts module. Based on our results, XRec effectively generates personalized explanations and its stability is improved by incorporating collaborative information. However, XRec did not consistently outperform all baseline models in every metric. Our extended analysis further highlights the importance of the Mixture of Experts embeddings in shaping the explanation structures, showcasing how collaborative signals interact with language modeling. Through our work, we provide an open-source evaluation implementation that enhances accessibility for researchers and practitioners alike. Our complete code repository can be found at https://github.com/julianbibo/xrec-reproducibility.

Abstract: Focal Cortical Dysplasia (FCD) is a primary cause of drug-resistant epilepsy and is difficult to detect in brain {magnetic resonance imaging} (MRI) due to the subtle and small-scale nature of its lesions. Accurate segmentation of FCD regions in 3D multimodal brain MRI images is essential for effective surgical planning and treatment. However, this task remains highly challenging due to the limited availability of annotated FCD datasets, the extremely small size and weak contrast of FCD lesions, the complexity of handling 3D multimodal inputs, and the need for output smoothness and anatomical consistency, which is often not addressed by standard voxel-wise loss functions. This paper presents a new framework for segmenting FCD regions in 3D brain MRI images. We adopt state-of-the-art transformer-enhanced encoder-decoder architecture and introduce a novel loss function combining Dice loss with an anisotropic {Total Variation} (TV) term. This integration encourages spatial smoothness and reduces false positive clusters without relying on post-processing. The framework is evaluated on a public FCD dataset with 85 epilepsy patients and demonstrates superior segmentation accuracy and consistency compared to standard loss formulations. The model with the proposed TV loss shows an 11.9\% improvement on the Dice coefficient and 13.3\% higher precision over the baseline model. Moreover, the number of false positive clusters is reduced by 61.6%

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural networks, supported by foundational theoretical insights, emphasize the superior representational power of complex numbers. However, their adoption in randomized neural networks (RNNs) has been limited due to the lack of effective methods for transforming real-valued tabular datasets into complex-valued representations. To address this limitation, we propose two methods for generating complex-valued representations from real-valued datasets: a natural transformation and an autoencoder-driven method. Building on these mechanisms, we propose RVFL-X, a complex-valued extension of the random vector functional link (RVFL) network. RVFL-X integrates complex transformations into real-valued datasets while maintaining the simplicity and efficiency of the original RVFL architecture. By leveraging complex components such as input, weights, and activation functions, RVFL-X processes complex representations and produces real-valued outputs. Comprehensive evaluations on 80 real-valued UCI datasets demonstrate that RVFL-X consistently outperforms both the original RVFL and state-of-the-art (SOTA) RNN variants, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness across diverse application domains.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs), such as CLIP and OpenCLIP, can encode and reflect stereotypical associations between medical professions and demographic attributes learned from web-scale data. We present an evaluation protocol for healthcare settings that quantifies associated biases and assesses their operational risk. Our methodology (i) defines a taxonomy spanning clinicians and allied healthcare roles (e.g., surgeon, cardiologist, dentist, nurse, pharmacist, technician), (ii) curates a profession-aware prompt suite to probe model behavior, and (iii) benchmarks demographic skew against a balanced face corpus. Empirically, we observe consistent demographic biases across multiple roles and vision models. Our work highlights the importance of bias identification in critical domains such as healthcare as AI-enabled hiring and workforce analytics can have downstream implications for equity, compliance, and patient trust.

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) solar imaging is crucial for capturing fine-scale dynamic features such as filaments and fibrils. However, the spatial resolution of the full-disk H$\alpha$ images is limited and insufficient to resolve these small-scale structures. To address this, we propose a GAN-based superresolution approach to enhance low-resolution (LR) full-disk H$\alpha$ images from the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) to a quality comparable with HR observations from the Big Bear Solar Observatory/Goode Solar Telescope (BBSO/GST). We employ Real-ESRGAN with Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks and a relativistic discriminator. We carefully aligned GONG-GST pairs. The model effectively recovers fine details within sunspot penumbrae and resolves fine details in filaments and fibrils, achieving an average mean squared error (MSE) of 467.15, root mean squared error (RMSE) of 21.59, and cross-correlation (CC) of 0.7794. Slight misalignments between image pairs limit quantitative performance, which we plan to address in future work alongside dataset expansion to further improve reconstruction quality.

<title>SER-Diff: Synthetic Error Replay Diffusion for Incremental Brain Tumor Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Incremental brain tumor segmentation is critical for models that must adapt to evolving clinical datasets without retraining on all prior data. However, catastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously acquired knowledge, remains a major obstacle. Recent incremental learning frameworks with knowledge distillation partially mitigate forgetting but rely heavily on generative replay or auxiliary storage. Meanwhile, diffusion models have proven effective for refining tumor segmentations, but have not been explored in incremental learning contexts. We propose Synthetic Error Replay Diffusion (SER-Diff), the first framework that unifies diffusion-based refinement with incremental learning. SER-Diff leverages a frozen teacher diffusion model to generate synthetic error maps from past tasks, which are replayed during training on new tasks. A dual-loss formulation combining Dice loss for new data and knowledge distillation loss for replayed errors ensures both adaptability and retention. Experiments on BraTS2020, BraTS2021, and BraTS2023 demonstrate that SER-Diff consistently outperforms prior methods. It achieves the highest Dice scores of 95.8\%, 94.9\%, and 94.6\%, along with the lowest HD95 values of 4.4 mm, 4.7 mm, and 4.9 mm, respectively. These results indicate that SER-Diff not only mitigates catastrophic forgetting but also delivers more accurate and anatomically coherent segmentations across evolving datasets.

Abstract: Identifying cancer driver genes (CDGs) is essential for understanding cancer mechanisms and developing targeted therapies. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently been employed to identify CDGs by capturing patterns in biological interaction networks. However, most GNN-based approaches rely on a single protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, ignoring complementary information from other biological networks. Some studies integrate multiple networks by aligning features with consistency constraints to learn unified gene representations for CDG identification. However, such representation-level fusion often assumes congruent gene relationships across networks, which may overlook network heterogeneity and introduce conflicting information. To address this, we propose Soft-Evidence Fusion Graph Neural Network (SEFGNN), a novel framework for CDG identification across multiple networks at the decision level. Instead of enforcing feature-level consistency, SEFGNN treats each biological network as an independent evidence source and performs uncertainty-aware fusion at the decision level using Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST). To alleviate the risk of overconfidence from DST, we further introduce a Soft Evidence Smoothing (SES) module that improves ranking stability while preserving discriminative performance. Experiments on three cancer datasets show that SEFGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and exhibits strong potential in discovering novel CDGs.

Abstract: The widespread use of GPS devices has driven advances in spatiotemporal data mining, enabling machine learning models to simulate human decision making and generate realistic trajectories, addressing both data collection costs and privacy concerns. Recent studies have shown the promise of diffusion models for high-quality trajectory generation. However, most existing methods rely on convolution based architectures (e.g. UNet) to predict noise during the diffusion process, which often results in notable deviations and the loss of fine-grained street-level details due to limited model capacity. In this paper, we propose Trajectory Transformer, a novel model that employs a transformer backbone for both conditional information embedding and noise prediction. We explore two GPS coordinate embedding strategies, location embedding and longitude-latitude embedding, and analyze model performance at different scales. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that Trajectory Transformer significantly enhances generation quality and effectively alleviates the deviation issues observed in prior approaches.

Abstract: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance in multimodal tasks, hallucinations continue to hinder their reliability. Among the three categories of hallucinations, which include object, attribute, and relation, relation hallucinations account for the largest proportion but have received the least attention. To address this issue, we propose ChainMPQ (Multi-Perspective Questions guided Interleaved Chain of Image and Text), a training-free method that improves relational inference in LVLMs by utilizing accumulated textual and visual memories. ChainMPQ first extracts subject and object keywords from the question to enhance the corresponding image regions. It then constructs multi-perspective questions that focus on the three core components of a relationship: the subject, the object, and the relation that links them. These questions are sequentially input to the model, with textual and visual memories from earlier steps providing supporting context for subsequent ones, thereby forming an interleaved chain of images and text that guides progressive relational reasoning. Experiments on multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that ChainMPQ substantially reduces relation hallucinations, while ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of its three core modules.

Abstract: Predicting precipitation maps is a highly complex spatiotemporal modeling task, critical for mitigating the impacts of extreme weather events. Short-term precipitation forecasting, or nowcasting, requires models that are not only accurate but also computationally efficient for real-time applications. Current methods, such as token-based autoregressive models, often suffer from flawed inductive biases and slow inference, while diffusion models can be computationally intensive. To address these limitations, we introduce BlockGPT, a generative autoregressive transformer using batched tokenization (Block) method that predicts full two-dimensional fields (frames) at each time step. Conceived as a model-agnostic paradigm for video prediction, BlockGPT factorizes space-time by using self-attention within each frame and causal attention across frames; in this work, we instantiate it for precipitation nowcasting. We evaluate BlockGPT on two precipitation datasets, viz. KNMI (Netherlands) and SEVIR (U.S.), comparing it to state-of-the-art baselines including token-based (NowcastingGPT) and diffusion-based (DiffCast+Phydnet) models. The results show that BlockGPT achieves superior accuracy, event localization as measured by categorical metrics, and inference speeds up to 31x faster than comparable baselines.

Abstract: High-resolution (4K) image-to-image synthesis has become increasingly important for mobile applications. Existing diffusion models for image editing face significant challenges, in terms of memory and image quality, when deployed on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present MobilePicasso, a novel system that enables efficient image editing at high resolutions, while minimising computational cost and memory usage. MobilePicasso comprises three stages: (i) performing image editing at a standard resolution with hallucination-aware loss, (ii) applying latent projection to overcome going to the pixel space, and (iii) upscaling the edited image latent to a higher resolution with adaptive context-preserving tiling. Our user study with 46 participants reveals that MobilePicasso not only improves image quality by 18-48% but reduces hallucinations by 14-51% over existing methods. MobilePicasso demonstrates significantly lower latency, e.g., up to 55.8$\times$ speed-up, yet with a small increase in runtime memory, e.g., a mere 9% increase over prior work. Surprisingly, the on-device runtime of MobilePicasso is observed to be faster than a server-based high-resolution image editing model running on an A100 GPU.

Abstract: Formal verification is the next frontier for ensuring the correctness of code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). While methods that co-generate code and formal specifications in formal languages, like Dafny, can, in principle, prove alignment with user intent, progress is bottlenecked by specification quality evaluation. Current benchmarks rely on matching against ground-truth specifications, a manual and expertise-intensive process that has limited existing datasets to a few hundred simple problems and also suffers from a reliability issue. To address this, we introduce VeriEquivBench, a new benchmark with $2,389$ complex algorithmic problems that probe the limitations of current models in both code generation and formal reasoning. Our evaluation framework replaces ground-truth matching with a formally grounded metric, the equivalence score, and rigorously verifies the quality of generated specifications and code. Our results show that generating formally verifiable code remains a profound challenge for state-of-the-art LLMs. This underscores both the difficulty of the task and the need for benchmarks like VeriEquivBench to drive progress toward scalable and reliable coding agents.

Abstract: Subject of this thesis is the implementation of an AI-based Gaze Tracking system using RGBD images that contain both color (RGB) and depth (D) information. To fuse the features extracted from the images, a module based on the Transformer architecture is used. The combination of RGBD input images and Transformers was chosen because it has not yet been investigated. Furthermore, a new dataset is created for training the AI models as existing datasets either do not contain depth information or only contain labels for Gaze Point Estimation that are not suitable for the task of Gaze Angle Estimation. Various model configurations are trained, validated and evaluated on a total of three different datasets. The trained models are then to be used in a real-time pipeline to estimate the gaze direction and thus the gaze point of a person in front of a computer screen. The AI model architecture used in this thesis is based on an earlier work by Lian et al. It uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to simultaneously remove depth map artifacts and extract head pose features. Lian et al. achieve a mean Euclidean error of 38.7mm on their own dataset ShanghaiTechGaze+. In this thesis, a model architecture with a Transformer module for feature fusion achieves a mean Euclidean error of 55.3mm on the same dataset, but we show that using no pre-trained GAN module leads to a mean Euclidean error of 30.1mm. Replacing the Transformer module with a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) improves the error to 26.9mm. These results are coherent with the ones on the other two datasets. On the ETH-XGaze dataset, the model with Transformer module achieves a mean angular error of 3.59{\deg} and without Transformer module 3.26{\deg}, whereas the fundamentally different model architecture used by the dataset authors Zhang et al. achieves a mean angular error of 2.04{\deg}.

<title>SDAR: A Synergistic Diffusion-AutoRegression Paradigm for Scalable Sequence Generation</title>

Abstract: We propose SDAR, a Synergistic Diffusion-Autoregression paradigm that unifies the training efficiency of autoregressive models with the parallel inference capability of diffusion. Instead of costly end-to-end diffusion training, SDAR performs a lightweight paradigm conversion that transforms a well-trained autoregressive (AR) model into a blockwise diffusion model through brief, data-efficient adaptation. During inference, SDAR generates sequences autoregressively across blocks for global coherence while decoding all tokens within each block in parallel via a discrete diffusion process. Extensive experiments show that AR models remain substantially more compute-efficient than masked diffusion models, providing a strong foundation for adaptation. Building on this insight, SDAR achieves efficient AR-to-diffusion conversion with minimal cost, preserving AR-level performance while enabling parallel generation. Scaling studies across dense and Mixture-of-Experts architectures confirm that SDAR scales without compromise: larger models exhibit stronger robustness to block size and decoding thresholds, yielding greater speedups without accuracy loss. Beyond efficiency, SDAR demonstrates enhanced reasoning and domain adaptability. Our 30B MoE model surpasses its AR counterpart on challenging scientific reasoning benchmarks such as GPQA and ChemBench, and gains further improvements under test-time scaling methods like majority voting and pass@k. Together, these results establish SDAR as a practical paradigm that combines the strengths of autoregression and diffusion for scalable, high-throughput reasoning.

<title>Leveraging Large Language Models for Cybersecurity Risk Assessment -- A Case from Forestry Cyber-Physical Systems</title>

Abstract: In safety-critical software systems, cybersecurity activities become essential, with risk assessment being one of the most critical. In many software teams, cybersecurity experts are either entirely absent or represented by only a small number of specialists. As a result, the workload for these experts becomes high, and software engineers would need to conduct cybersecurity activities themselves. This creates a need for a tool to support cybersecurity experts and engineers in evaluating vulnerabilities and threats during the risk assessment process. This paper explores the potential of leveraging locally hosted large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation to support cybersecurity risk assessment in the forestry domain while complying with data protection and privacy requirements that limit external data sharing. We performed a design science study involving 12 experts in interviews, interactive sessions, and a survey within a large-scale project. The results demonstrate that LLMs can assist cybersecurity experts by generating initial risk assessments, identifying threats, and providing redundancy checks. The results also highlight the necessity for human oversight to ensure accuracy and compliance. Despite trust concerns, experts were willing to utilize LLMs in specific evaluation and assistance roles, rather than solely relying on their generative capabilities. This study provides insights that encourage the use of LLM-based agents to support the risk assessment process of cyber-physical systems in safety-critical domains.

Abstract: Foundation models have rapidly advanced AI, raising the question of whether their decisions will ultimately surpass human strategies in real-world domains. The exponential, and possibly super-exponential, pace of AI development makes such analysis elusive. Nevertheless, many application areas that matter for daily life and society show only modest gains so far; a prominent case is diagnosing and treating dynamically evolving disease in intensive care.
  The common challenge is adapting complex systems to dynamic environments. Effective strategies must optimize outcomes in systems composed of strongly interacting functions while avoiding shared side effects; this requires reliable, self-adaptive modeling. These tasks align with building digital twins of highly complex systems whose mechanisms are not fully or quantitatively understood. It is therefore essential to develop methods for self-adapting AI models with minimal data and limited mechanistic knowledge. As this challenge extends beyond medicine, AI should demonstrate clear superiority in these settings before assuming broader decision-making roles.
  We identify the curse of dimensionality as a fundamental barrier to efficient self-adaptation and argue that monolithic foundation models face conceptual limits in overcoming it. As an alternative, we propose a decentralized architecture of interacting small agent networks (SANs). We focus on agents representing the specialized substructure of the system, where each agent covers only a subset of the full system functions. Drawing on mathematical results on the learning behavior of SANs and evidence from existing applications, we argue that swarm-learning in diverse swarms can enable self-adaptive SANs to deliver superior decision-making in dynamic environments compared with monolithic foundation models, though at the cost of reduced reproducibility in detail.

Abstract: Online communities rely on a mix of platform policies and community-authored rules to define acceptable behavior and maintain order. However, these rules vary widely across communities, evolve over time, and are enforced inconsistently, posing challenges for transparency, governance, and automation. In this paper, we model the relationship between rules and their enforcement at scale, introducing ModQ, a novel question-answering framework for rule-sensitive content moderation. Unlike prior classification or generation-based approaches, ModQ conditions on the full set of community rules at inference time and identifies which rule best applies to a given comment. We implement two model variants - extractive and multiple-choice QA - and train them on large-scale datasets from Reddit and Lemmy, the latter of which we construct from publicly available moderation logs and rule descriptions. Both models outperform state-of-the-art baselines in identifying moderation-relevant rule violations, while remaining lightweight and interpretable. Notably, ModQ models generalize effectively to unseen communities and rules, supporting low-resource moderation settings and dynamic governance environments.

Abstract: Face recognition in unconstrained environments such as surveillance, video, and web imagery must contend with extreme variation in pose, blur, illumination, and occlusion, where conventional visual quality metrics fail to predict whether inputs are truly recognizable to the deployed encoder. Existing FIQA methods typically rely on visual heuristics, curated annotations, or computationally intensive generative pipelines, leaving their predictions detached from the encoder's decision geometry. We introduce TransFIRA (Transfer Learning for Face Image Recognizability Assessment), a lightweight and annotation-free framework that grounds recognizability directly in embedding space. TransFIRA delivers three advances: (i) a definition of recognizability via class-center similarity (CCS) and class-center angular separation (CCAS), yielding the first natural, decision-boundary--aligned criterion for filtering and weighting; (ii) a recognizability-informed aggregation strategy that achieves state-of-the-art verification accuracy on BRIAR and IJB-C while nearly doubling correlation with true recognizability, all without external labels, heuristics, or backbone-specific training; and (iii) new extensions beyond faces, including encoder-grounded explainability that reveals how degradations and subject-specific factors affect recognizability, and the first recognizability-aware body recognition assessment. Experiments confirm state-of-the-art results on faces, strong performance on body recognition, and robustness under cross-dataset shifts. Together, these contributions establish TransFIRA as a unified, geometry-driven framework for recognizability assessment -- encoder-specific, accurate, interpretable, and extensible across modalities -- significantly advancing FIQA in accuracy, explainability, and scope.

<title>Constrained Natural Language Action Planning for Resilient Embodied Systems</title>

Abstract: Replicating human-level intelligence in the execution of embodied tasks remains challenging due to the unconstrained nature of real-world environments. Novel use of large language models (LLMs) for task planning seeks to address the previously intractable state/action space of complex planning tasks, but hallucinations limit their reliability, and thus, viability beyond a research context. Additionally, the prompt engineering required to achieve adequate system performance lacks transparency, and thus, repeatability. In contrast to LLM planning, symbolic planning methods offer strong reliability and repeatability guarantees, but struggle to scale to the complexity and ambiguity of real-world tasks. We introduce a new robotic planning method that augments LLM planners with symbolic planning oversight to improve reliability and repeatability, and provide a transparent approach to defining hard constraints with considerably stronger clarity than traditional prompt engineering. Importantly, these augmentations preserve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs and retain impressive generalization in open-world environments. We demonstrate our approach in simulated and real-world environments. On the ALFWorld planning benchmark, our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving a near-perfect 99% success rate. Deployment of our method to a real-world quadruped robot resulted in 100% task success compared to 50% and 30% for pure LLM and symbolic planners across embodied pick and place tasks. Our approach presents an effective strategy to enhance the reliability, repeatability and transparency of LLM-based robot planners while retaining their key strengths: flexibility and generalizability to complex real-world environments. We hope that this work will contribute to the broad goal of building resilient embodied intelligent systems.

Abstract: Large-scale multimodal models achieve strong results on tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA), but they often fail when queries require culturally grounded, everyday knowledge, particularly in low-resource and underrepresented languages. To bridge this gap, we introduce Everyday Multimodal and Multilingual QA (EverydayMMQA), a framework for creating large-scale, culturally-grounded datasets for spoken and visual question answering (SVQA). Using this framework, we developed OASIS, a multimodal dataset integrating speech, images, and text. With over ~0.92M images and 14.8M QA pairs, OASIS contains 3.7M spoken questions, enabling four unique input combinations: speech-only, text-only, speech+image, and text+image. Focused on English and Arabic varieties, 18 countries, the dataset content is curated to reflect diverse, real-world situations. OASIS tests models on tasks beyond object recognition that involve pragmatic, commonsense, and culturally aware reasoning. We benchmarked four closed-source models, three open-source models, and one fine-tuned model. EverydayMMQA and OASIS together provide a benchmark and training dataset for building multimodal LLMs for a comprehensive set of everyday tasks within cultural contexts. The framework and dataset will be made publicly available to the community.

Abstract: Pretrained transformers readily adapt to new sequence modeling tasks via zero-shot prompting, but relational domains still lack architectures that transfer across datasets and tasks. The core challenge is the diversity of relational data, with varying heterogeneous schemas, graph structures and functional dependencies. In this paper, we present the Relational Transformer (RT) architecture, which can be pretrained on diverse relational databases and directly applied to unseen datasets and tasks without task- or dataset-specific fine-tuning, or retrieval of in-context examples. RT (i) tokenizes cells with table/column metadata, (ii) is pretrained via masked token prediction, and (iii) utilizes a novel \textit{Relational Attention} mechanism over columns, rows, and primary-foreign key links. Pretrained on RelBench datasets spanning tasks such as churn and sales forecasting, RT attains strong zero-shot performance, averaging 94% of fully supervised AUROC on binary classification tasks with a single forward pass of a 22M parameter model, as opposed to 84% for a 27B LLM. Fine-tuning yields state-of-the-art results with high sample efficiency. Our experiments show that RT's zero-shot transfer harnesses task-table context, relational attention patterns and schema semantics. Overall, RT provides a practical path toward foundation models for relational data.

Abstract: We propose Monte Carlo Permutation Search (MCPS), a general-purpose Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm that improves upon the GRAVE algorithm. MCPS is relevant when deep reinforcement learning is not an option, or when the computing power available before play is not substantial, such as in General Game Playing, for example. The principle of MCPS is to include in the exploration term of a node the statistics on all the playouts that contain all the moves on the path from the root to the node. We extensively test MCPS on a variety of games: board games, wargame, investment game, video game and multi-player games. MCPS has better results than GRAVE in all the two-player games. It has equivalent results for multi-player games because these games are inherently balanced even when players have different strengths. We also show that using abstract codes for moves instead of exact codes can be beneficial to both MCPS and GRAVE, as they improve the permutation statistics and the AMAF statistics. We also provide a mathematical derivation of the formulas used for weighting the three sources of statistics. These formulas are an improvement on the GRAVE formula since they no longer use the bias hyperparameter of GRAVE. Moreover, MCPS is not sensitive to the ref hyperparameter.

<title>Protecting De-identified Documents from Search-based Linkage Attacks</title>

Abstract: While de-identification models can help conceal the identity of the individual(s) mentioned in a document, they fail to address linkage risks, defined as the potential to map the de-identified text back to its source. One straightforward way to perform such linkages is to extract phrases from the de-identified document and then check their presence in the original dataset. This paper presents a method to counter search-based linkage attacks while preserving the semantic integrity of the text. The method proceeds in two steps. We first construct an inverted index of the N-grams occurring in the document collection, making it possible to efficiently determine which N-grams appear in less than $k$ documents (either alone or in combination with other N-grams). An LLM-based rewriter is then iteratively queried to reformulate those spans until linkage is no longer possible. Experimental results on a collection of court cases show that the method is able to effectively prevent search-based linkages while remaining faithful to the original content.

<title>Reward Model Perspectives: Whose Opinions Do Reward Models Reward?</title>

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are central to the alignment of language models (LMs). An RM often serves as a proxy for human preferences to guide downstream LM behavior. However, our understanding of RM behavior is limited. Our work (i) formalizes a framework for measuring the alignment of opinions captured by RMs, (ii) investigates the extent to which RMs demonstrate sociodemographic biases, and (iii) explores the effects of prompting to steer rewards towards the preferences of a target group. We study the subjective and diverse perspectives on controversial topics, which allows us to quantify RM perspectives in terms of their opinions, attitudes, and values. We show that RMs are poorly aligned with several demographic groups and can systematically reward harmful stereotypes, and steering alone is not enough to overcome these limitations. Our findings underscore the need for more careful consideration of RM behavior in model alignment during preference learning to prevent the propagation of unwanted social biases in the language technologies that we use.

Abstract: Computational protein design is experiencing a transformation driven by AI/ML. However, the range of potential protein sequences and structures is astronomically vast, even for moderately sized proteins. Hence, achieving convergence between generated and predicted structures demands substantial computational resources for sampling. The Integrated Machine-learning for Protein Structures at Scale (IMPRESS) offers methods and advanced computing systems for coupling AI to high-performance computing tasks, enabling the ability to evaluate the effectiveness of protein designs as they are developed, as well as the models and simulations used to generate data and train models. This paper introduces IMPRESS and demonstrates the development and implementation of an adaptive protein design protocol and its supporting computing infrastructure. This leads to increased consistency in the quality of protein design and enhanced throughput of protein design due to dynamic resource allocation and asynchronous workload execution.

<title>Geometry-Aware Backdoor Attacks: Leveraging Curvature in Hyperbolic Embeddings</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.06397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Euclidean foundation models increasingly place representations in curved spaces such as hyperbolic geometry. We show that this geometry creates a boundary-driven asymmetry that backdoor triggers can exploit. Near the boundary, small input changes appear subtle to standard input-space detectors but produce disproportionately large shifts in the model's representation space. Our analysis formalizes this effect and also reveals a limitation for defenses: methods that act by pulling points inward along the radius can suppress such triggers, but only by sacrificing useful model sensitivity in that same direction. Building on these insights, we propose a simple geometry-adaptive trigger and evaluate it across tasks and architectures. Empirically, attack success increases toward the boundary, whereas conventional detectors weaken, mirroring the theoretical trends. Together, these results surface a geometry-specific vulnerability in non-Euclidean models and offer analysis-backed guidance for designing and understanding the limits of defenses.

Abstract: In decentralized learning networks, predictions from many participants are combined to generate a network inference. While many studies have demonstrated performance benefits of combining multiple model predictions, existing strategies using linear pooling methods (ranging from simple averaging to dynamic weight updates) face a key limitation. Dynamic prediction combinations that rely on historical performance to update weights are necessarily reactive. Due to the need to average over a reasonable number of epochs (with moving averages or exponential weighting), they tend to be slow to adjust to changing circumstances (phase or regime changes). In this work, we develop a model that uses machine learning to forecast the performance of predictions by models at each epoch in a time series. This enables `context-awareness' by assigning higher weight to models that are likely to be more accurate at a given time. We show that adding a performance forecasting worker in a decentralized learning network, following a design similar to the Allora network, can improve the accuracy of network inferences. Specifically, we find forecasting models that predict regret (performance relative to the network inference) or regret z-score (performance relative to other workers) show greater improvement than models predicting losses, which often do not outperform the naive network inference (historically weighted average of all inferences). Through a series of optimization tests, we show that the performance of the forecasting model can be sensitive to choices in the feature set and number of training epochs. These properties may depend on the exact problem and should be tailored to each domain. Although initially designed for a decentralized learning network, using performance forecasting for prediction combination may be useful in any situation where predictive rather than reactive model weighting is needed.

Abstract: The rapid shift from passive LLMs to autonomous LLM-agents marks a new paradigm in cybersecurity. While these agents can act as powerful tools for both offensive and defensive operations, the very agentic context introduces a new class of inherent security risks. In this work we present the first holistic survey of the agentic security landscape, structuring the field around three interdependent pillars: Applications, Threats, and Defenses. We provide a comprehensive taxonomy of over 150 papers, explaining how agents are used, the vulnerabilities they possess, and the countermeasures designed to protect them. A detailed cross-cutting analysis shows emerging trends in agent architecture while revealing critical research gaps in model and modality coverage.

Abstract: Transferability estimation metrics are used to find a high-performing pre-trained model for a given target task without fine-tuning models and without access to the source dataset. Despite the growing interest in developing such metrics, the benchmarks used to measure their progress have gone largely unexamined. In this work, we empirically show the shortcomings of widely used benchmark setups to evaluate transferability estimation metrics. We argue that the benchmarks on which these metrics are evaluated are fundamentally flawed. We empirically demonstrate that their unrealistic model spaces and static performance hierarchies artificially inflate the perceived performance of existing metrics, to the point where simple, dataset-agnostic heuristics can outperform sophisticated methods. Our analysis reveals a critical disconnect between current evaluation protocols and the complexities of real-world model selection. To address this, we provide concrete recommendations for constructing more robust and realistic benchmarks to guide future research in a more meaningful direction.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become ubiquitous in workplace tools and decision-making processes, ensuring explainability and fostering user trust are critical. Although advancements in LLM engineering continue, human-centered design is still catching up, particularly when it comes to embedding transparency and trust into AI interfaces. This study evaluates user experiences with two distinct AI interfaces - node-tree interfaces and chatbot interfaces - to assess their performance in exploratory, follow-up inquiry, decision-making, and problem-solving tasks. Our design-driven approach introduces a node-tree interface that visually structures AI-generated responses into hierarchically organized, interactive nodes, allowing users to navigate, refine, and follow up on complex information. In a comparative study with n=20 business users, we observed that while the chatbot interface effectively supports linear, step-by-step queries, it is the node-tree interface that enhances brainstorming. Quantitative and qualitative findings indicate that node-tree interfaces not only improve task performance and decision-making support but also promote higher levels of user trust by preserving context. Our findings suggest that adaptive AI interfaces capable of switching between structured visualizations and conversational formats based on task requirements can significantly enhance transparency and user confidence in AI-powered systems. This work contributes actionable insights to the fields of human-robot interaction and AI design, particularly for enterprise applications where trust-building is critical for teams.

Abstract: Understanding and modeling human mobility is central to challenges in transport planning, sustainable urban design, and public health. Despite decades of effort, simulating individual mobility remains challenging because of its complex, context-dependent, and exploratory nature. Here, we present MobilityGen, a deep generative model that produces realistic mobility trajectories spanning days to weeks at large spatial scales. By linking behavioral attributes with environmental context, MobilityGen reproduces key patterns such as scaling laws for location visits, activity time allocation, and the coupled evolution of travel mode and destination choices. It reflects spatio-temporal variability and generates diverse, plausible, and novel mobility patterns consistent with the built environment. Beyond standard validation, MobilityGen yields insights not attainable with earlier models, including how access to urban space varies across travel modes and how co-presence dynamics shape social exposure and segregation. Our work establishes a new framework for mobility simulation, paving the way for fine-grained, data-driven studies of human behavior and its societal implications.

Abstract: Attention sinks and compression valleys have attracted significant attention as two puzzling phenomena in large language models, but have been studied in isolation. In this work, we present a surprising connection between attention sinks and compression valleys, tracing both to the formation of massive activations in the residual stream. We prove theoretically that massive activations necessarily produce representational compression and establish bounds on the resulting entropy reduction. Through experiments across several models (410M-120B parameters), we confirm that when the beginning-of-sequence token develops extreme activation norms in the middle layers, both compression valleys and attention sinks emerge simultaneously. Targeted ablation studies validate our theoretical predictions. This unified view motivates us to propose the Mix-Compress-Refine theory of information flow, as an attempt to explain how LLMs organize their computation in depth by controlling attention and representational compression via massive activations. Specifically, we posit that Transformer-based LLMs process tokens in three distinct phases: (1) broad mixing in the early layers, (2) compressed computation with limited mixing in the middle layers, and (3) selective refinement in the late layers. Our framework helps explain why embedding tasks perform best at intermediate layers, whereas generation tasks benefit from full-depth processing, clarifying differences in task-dependent representations.

Abstract: We introduce Sequential-EDFL (Empirical Dynamic Formal Lift), applying anytime-valid sequential testing to language model generation stopping. Our approach tracks information lift -- the log-likelihood ratio between full models and deliberately weakened "skeleton" baselines -- using self-normalized empirical-Bernstein e-processes that provide formal delta-level error control regardless of stopping time. We handle unknown centering through online mean estimation, combine multiple parameters via mixture e-processes, and support adaptive resets under distributional drift. On six benchmarks, Sequential-EDFL reduces generation by 22-28% vs. sequential baselines while maintaining delta-level control with 12% computational overhead. We introduce automated skeletons (distilled submodels, randomized logits) and show robustness across skeleton families. Composing EDFL with a lightweight correctness gate (sentence boundaries + verifier) improves end-task correctness while preserving anytime-valid guarantees by only delaying stopping. Our certificates control information sufficiency, not factual correctness -- 10.9% of stopped sequences remain incorrect even with the gate (13.2-22.7% without it). EDFL serves as a first-stage filter reducing verification burden by 83%, not as a standalone solution for safety-critical domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success through imitation learning on vast text corpora, but this paradigm creates a training-generation gap and limits robust reasoning. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a more data-efficient solution capable of bridging this gap, yet its application has been constrained by a critical data bottleneck: existing RL datasets are orders of magnitude smaller and less diverse than web-scale pre-training corpora. To address this, we introduce the Webscale-RL pipeline, a scalable data engine that systematically converts large-scale pre-training documents into millions of diverse, verifiable question-answer pairs for RL. Using this pipeline, we construct the Webscale-RL dataset, containing 1.2 million examples across more than 9 domains. Our experiments show that the model trained on this dataset significantly outperforms continual pretraining and strong data refinement baselines across a suite of benchmarks. Notably, RL training with our dataset proves substantially more efficient, achieving the performance of continual pre-training with up to 100$\times$ fewer tokens. Our work presents a viable path toward scaling RL to pre-training levels, enabling more capable and efficient language models.

Abstract: Accurate time-series predictions in machine learning are heavily influenced by the selection of appropriate input time length and sampling rate. This paper introduces ATLO-ML, an adaptive time-length optimization system that automatically determines the optimal input time length and sampling rate based on user-defined output time length. The system provides a flexible approach to time-series data pre-processing, dynamically adjusting these parameters to enhance predictive performance. ATLO-ML is validated using air quality datasets, including both GAMS-dataset and proprietary data collected from a data center, both in time series format. Results demonstrate that utilizing the optimized time length and sampling rate significantly improves the accuracy of machine learning models compared to fixed time lengths. ATLO-ML shows potential for generalization across various time-sensitive applications, offering a robust solution for optimizing temporal input parameters in machine learning workflows.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection plays a crucial role in ensuring the robustness and reliability of machine learning systems deployed in real-world applications. Recent approaches have explored the use of unlabeled data, showing potential for enhancing OOD detection capabilities. However, effectively utilizing unlabeled in-the-wild data remains challenging due to the mixed nature of both in-distribution (InD) and OOD samples. The lack of a distinct set of OOD samples complicates the task of training an optimal OOD classifier. In this work, we introduce Medix, a novel framework designed to identify potential outliers from unlabeled data using the median operation. We use the median because it provides a stable estimate of the central tendency, as an OOD detection mechanism, due to its robustness against noise and outliers. Using these identified outliers, along with labeled InD data, we train a robust OOD classifier. From a theoretical perspective, we derive error bounds that demonstrate Medix achieves a low error rate. Empirical results further substantiate our claims, as Medix outperforms existing methods across the board in open-world settings, confirming the validity of our theoretical insights.

The likelihood of these detections is indicated by scores in [0, 1]. Lifting these scores to temporal properties over sequences can be useful for several downstream applications such as query matching (e.g., "does the speaker eventually sound happy in this audio clip?"), and ranked retrieval (e.g., "retrieve top 5 videos with a 10 second scene where a car is detected until a pedestrian is detected"). In this work, we formalize this problem of assigning Scores for TempOral Properties (STOPs) over sequences, given potentially noisy score predictors for local properties. We then propose a scoring function called LogSTOP that can efficiently compute these scores for temporal properties represented in Linear Temporal Logic. Empirically, LogSTOP, with YOLO and HuBERT, outperforms Large Vision / Audio Language Models and other Temporal Logic-based baselines by at least 16% on query matching with temporal properties over objects-in-videos and emotions-in-speech respectively. Similarly, on ranked retrieval with temporal properties over objects and actions in videos, LogSTOP with Grounding DINO and SlowR50 reports at least a 19% and 16% increase in mean average precision and recall over zero-shot text-to-video retrieval baselines respectively.

Abstract: This work walks through different visualization techniques for combinatorial search landscapes, focusing on multimodality. We discuss different techniques from the landscape analysis literature, and how they can be combined to provide a more comprehensive view of the search landscape. We also include examples and discuss relevant work to show how others have used these techniques in practice, based on the geometric and aesthetic elements of the Grammar of Graphics. We conclude that there is no free lunch in visualization, and provide recommendations for future work as there are several paths to continue the work in this field.

Abstract: Quantum compute is scaling fast, from cloud QPUs to high throughput GPU simulators, making it timely to prototype quantum NLP beyond toy tasks. However, devices remain qubit limited and depth limited, training can be unstable, and classical attention is compute and memory heavy. This motivates compact, phase aware quantum token mixers that stabilize amplitudes and scale to long sequences. We present CLAQS, a compact, fully quantum token mixer for text classification that jointly learns complex-valued mixing and nonlinear transformations within a unified quantum circuit. To enable stable end-to-end optimization, we apply l1 normalization to regulate amplitude scaling and introduce a two-stage parameterized quantum architecture that decouples shared token embeddings from a window-level quantum feed-forward module. Operating under a sliding-window regime with document-level aggregation, CLAQS requires only eight data qubits and shallow circuits, yet achieves 91.64% accuracy on SST-2 and 87.08% on IMDB, outperforming both classical Transformer baselines and strong hybrid quantum-classical counterparts.

<title>Scalable Policy-Based RL Algorithms for POMDPs</title>

Abstract: The continuous nature of belief states in POMDPs presents significant computational challenges in learning the optimal policy. In this paper, we consider an approach that solves a Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning (PORL) problem by approximating the corresponding POMDP model into a finite-state Markov Decision Process (MDP) (called Superstate MDP). We first derive theoretical guarantees that improve upon prior work that relate the optimal value function of the transformed Superstate MDP to the optimal value function of the original POMDP. Next, we propose a policy-based learning approach with linear function approximation to learn the optimal policy for the Superstate MDP. Consequently, our approach shows that a POMDP can be approximately solved using TD-learning followed by Policy Optimization by treating it as an MDP, where the MDP state corresponds to a finite history. We show that the approximation error decreases exponentially with the length of this history. To the best of our knowledge, our finite-time bounds are the first to explicitly quantify the error introduced when applying standard TD learning to a setting where the true dynamics are not Markovian.

Abstract: We investigate mathematically the notion of incoherence: a structural issue with reinforcement learning policies derived by naive goal-conditioning of autoregressive models. We focus on the process of re-training models on their own actions, that is, fine-tuning offline-learned policies with online RL. We prove that it decreases incoherence and leads to an improvement in return, and we aim to characterize the resulting trajectory of policies. By re-framing standard notions of control-as-inference and soft Q learning, we establish a three-way correspondence with two other ways of understanding the iterative re-training process: as folding the posterior into the reward and, in the deterministic case, as decreasing the temperature parameter; the correspondence has computational content via the training-inference trade-off. Through soft-conditioning generative models, we discuss the link between incoherence and the effective horizon.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become a strong recipe for training reasoning LLMs that produce long chains of thought (LongCoT). Yet the standard RL "thinking environment", where the state is the prompt plus all prior reasoning tokens, makes the state unbounded and forces attention-based policies to pay quadratic compute as thoughts lengthen. We revisit the environment itself. We propose Markovian Thinking, a paradigm in which the policy advances reasoning while conditioning on a constant-size state, decoupling thinking length from context size. As an immediate consequence this yields linear compute with constant memory. We instantiate this idea with Delethink, an RL environment that structures reasoning into fixed-size chunks. Within each chunk, the model thinks as usual; at the boundary, the environment resets the context and reinitializes the prompt with a short carryover. Through RL, the policy learns to write a textual state near the end of each chunk sufficient for seamless continuation of reasoning after reset. Trained in this environment, an R1-Distill 1.5B model reasons in 8K-token chunks yet thinks up to 24K tokens, matching or surpassing LongCoT-RL trained with a 24K budget. With test-time scaling, Delethink continues to improve where LongCoT plateaus. The effect of linear compute is substantial: we empirically estimate at 96K average thinking length LongCoT-RL costs 27 H100-months vs. 7 for Delethink. Analysis at RL initialization shows off-the-shelf reasoning models (1.5B-120B) often sample Markovian traces zero-shot across diverse benchmarks, providing positive samples that make RL effective at scale. Our results show that redesigning the thinking environment is a powerful lever: it enables very long reasoning without quadratic overhead and opens a path toward efficient, scalable reasoning LLMs.

<title>The Algebra of Meaning: Why Machines Need Montague More Than Moore's Law</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06559</link>

Abstract: Contemporary language models are fluent yet routinely mis-handle the types of meaning their outputs entail. We argue that hallucination, brittle moderation, and opaque compliance outcomes are symptoms of missing type-theoretic semantics rather than data or scale limitations. Building on Montague's view of language as typed, compositional algebra, we recast alignment as a parsing problem: natural-language inputs must be compiled into structures that make explicit their descriptive, normative, and legal dimensions under context.
  We present Savassan, a neuro-symbolic architecture that compiles utterances into Montague-style logical forms and maps them to typed ontologies extended with deontic operators and jurisdictional contexts. Neural components extract candidate structures from unstructured inputs; symbolic components perform type checking, constraint reasoning, and cross-jurisdiction mapping to produce compliance-aware guidance rather than binary censorship. In cross-border scenarios, the system "parses once" (e.g., defect claim(product x, company y)) and projects the result into multiple legal ontologies (e.g., defamation risk in KR/JP, protected opinion in US, GDPR checks in EU), composing outcomes into a single, explainable decision.
  This paper contributes: (i) a diagnosis of hallucination as a type error; (ii) a formal Montague-ontology bridge for business/legal reasoning; and (iii) a production-oriented design that embeds typed interfaces across the pipeline. We outline an evaluation plan using legal reasoning benchmarks and synthetic multi-jurisdiction suites. Our position is that trustworthy autonomy requires compositional typing of meaning, enabling systems to reason about what is described, what is prescribed, and what incurs liability within a unified algebra of meaning.

<title>HSNet: Heterogeneous Subgraph Network for Single Image Super-resolution</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Existing deep learning approaches for image super-resolution, particularly those based on CNNs and attention mechanisms, often suffer from structural inflexibility. Although graph-based methods offer greater representational adaptability, they are frequently impeded by excessive computational complexity. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes the Heterogeneous Subgraph Network (HSNet), a novel framework that efficiently leverages graph modeling while maintaining computational feasibility. The core idea of HSNet is to decompose the global graph into manageable sub-components. First, we introduce the Constructive Subgraph Set Block (CSSB), which generates a diverse set of complementary subgraphs. Rather than relying on a single monolithic graph, CSSB captures heterogeneous characteristics of the image by modeling different relational patterns and feature interactions, producing a rich ensemble of both local and global graph structures. Subsequently, the Subgraph Aggregation Block (SAB) integrates the representations embedded across these subgraphs. Through adaptive weighting and fusion of multi-graph features, SAB constructs a comprehensive and discriminative representation that captures intricate interdependencies. Furthermore, a Node Sampling Strategy (NSS) is designed to selectively retain the most salient features, thereby enhancing accuracy while reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively balancing reconstruction quality with computational efficiency. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for supporting clinical trials, from patient recruitment and endpoint assessment to treatment response prediction. However, deploying AI without safeguards poses significant risks, particularly when evaluating patient endpoints that directly impact trial conclusions. We compared two AI frameworks against human-only assessment for medical image-based disease evaluation, measuring cost, accuracy, robustness, and generalization ability. To stress-test these frameworks, we injected bad models, ranging from random guesses to naive predictions, to ensure that observed treatment effects remain valid even under severe model degradation. We evaluated the frameworks using two randomized controlled trials with endpoints derived from spinal X-ray images. Our findings indicate that using AI as a supporting reader (AI-SR) is the most suitable approach for clinical trials, as it meets all criteria across various model types, even with bad models. This method consistently provides reliable disease estimation, preserves clinical trial treatment effect estimates and conclusions, and retains these advantages when applied to different populations.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning models depends heavily on training data. The scarcity of large-scale, well-annotated datasets poses significant challenges in creating robust models. To address this, synthetic data generated through simulations and generative models has emerged as a promising solution, enhancing dataset diversity and improving the performance, reliability, and resilience of models. However, evaluating the quality of this generated data requires an effective metric. This paper introduces the Synthetic Dataset Quality Metric (SDQM) to assess data quality for object detection tasks without requiring model training to converge. This metric enables more efficient generation and selection of synthetic datasets, addressing a key challenge in resource-constrained object detection tasks. In our experiments, SDQM demonstrated a strong correlation with the mean Average Precision (mAP) scores of YOLOv11, a leading object detection model, while previous metrics only exhibited moderate or weak correlations. Additionally, it provides actionable insights for improving dataset quality, minimizing the need for costly iterative training. This scalable and efficient metric sets a new standard for evaluating synthetic data. The code for SDQM is available at https://github.com/ayushzenith/SDQM

<title>Reading Between the Lines: Towards Reliable Black-box LLM Fingerprinting via Zeroth-order Gradient Estimation</title>

arXiv:2510.06605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The substantial investment required to develop Large Language Models (LLMs) makes them valuable intellectual property, raising significant concerns about copyright protection. LLM fingerprinting has emerged as a key technique to address this, which aims to verify a model's origin by extracting an intrinsic, unique signature (a "fingerprint") and comparing it to that of a source model to identify illicit copies. However, existing black-box fingerprinting methods often fail to generate distinctive LLM fingerprints. This ineffectiveness arises because black-box methods typically rely on model outputs, which lose critical information about the model's unique parameters due to the usage of non-linear functions. To address this, we first leverage Fisher Information Theory to formally demonstrate that the gradient of the model's input is a more informative feature for fingerprinting than the output. Based on this insight, we propose ZeroPrint, a novel method that approximates these information-rich gradients in a black-box setting using zeroth-order estimation. ZeroPrint overcomes the challenge of applying this to discrete text by simulating input perturbations via semantic-preserving word substitutions. This operation allows ZeroPrint to estimate the model's Jacobian matrix as a unique fingerprint. Experiments on the standard benchmark show ZeroPrint achieves a state-of-the-art effectiveness and robustness, significantly outperforming existing black-box methods.

Abstract: Underground water and wastewater pipelines are vital for city operations but plagued by anomalies like leaks and infiltrations, causing substantial water loss, environmental damage, and high repair costs. Conventional manual inspections lack efficiency, while dense sensor deployments are prohibitively expensive. In recent years, artificial intelligence has advanced rapidly and is increasingly applied to urban infrastructure. In this research, we propose an integrated AI and remote-sensor framework to address the challenge of leak detection in underground water pipelines, through deploying a sparse set of remote sensors to capture real-time flow and depth data, paired with HydroNet - a dedicated model utilizing pipeline attributes (e.g., material, diameter, slope) in a directed graph for higher-precision modeling. Evaluations on a real-world campus wastewater network dataset demonstrate that our system collects effective spatio-temporal hydraulic data, enabling HydroNet to outperform advanced baselines. This integration of edge-aware message passing with hydraulic simulations enables accurate network-wide predictions from limited sensor deployments. We envision that this approach can be effectively extended to a wide range of underground water pipeline networks.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in test-time scaling and finetuning of diffusion models, guidance in Auto-Regressive Diffusion Models (ARDMs) remains underexplored. We introduce an amortized framework that augments pretrained ARDMs with a lightweight controller network, trained offline by previewing future ARDM rollouts and learning stepwise controls that anticipate upcoming observations under a terminal cost objective. We evaluate this framework in the context of data assimilation (DA) for chaotic spatiotemporal partial differential equations (PDEs), a setting where existing methods are often computationally prohibitive and prone to forecast drift under sparse observations. Our approach reduces DA inference to a single forward rollout with on-the-fly corrections, avoiding expensive adjoint computations and/or optimizations during inference. We demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms four state-of-the-art baselines in stability, accuracy, and physical fidelity across two canonical PDEs and six observation regimes. We will release code and checkpoints publicly.

Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KVQA) requires models to ground entities in images and reason over factual knowledge. We study its implicit-knowledge variant, IK-KVQA, where a multimodal large language model (MLLM) is the sole knowledge source, without external retrieval. Yet, MLLMs lack explicit reasoning supervision and produce inconsistent justifications, and generalize poorly after standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We present StaR-KVQA (Structured Reasoning Traces for IK-KVQA), which supervises structured traces - dual symbolic relation paths plus path-grounded natural-language explanations - so that reasoning becomes transparent and verifiable. With one open-source MLLM, StaR-KVQA constructs and selects path-grounded reasoning traces to form a trace-enriched dataset, then fine-tunes via structured self-distillation to align generation with supervision; no external retrievers, verifiers, or curated knowledge bases (KBs) are used, traces are built offline, and inference is a single autoregressive pass. Across benchmarks, StaR-KVQA improves both accuracy and interpretability, achieving up to +11.3% higher answer accuracy on OK-VQA over the strongest baseline while exhibiting robust cross-domain generalization.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern software systems exacerbates the prevalence of security vulnerabilities, posing risks of severe breaches and substantial economic loss. Consequently, robust code vulnerability detection is essential for software security. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing, their potential for automated code vulnerability detection remains underexplored. This paper presents FineSec, a novel framework that harnesses LLMs through knowledge distillation to enable efficient and precise vulnerability identification in C/C++ codebases. FineSec utilizes knowledge distillation to transfer expertise from large teacher models to compact student models, achieving high accuracy with minimal computational cost. By integrating data preparation, training, evaluation, and continuous learning into a unified, single-task workflow, FineSec offers a streamlined approach. Extensive evaluations on C/C++ codebases demonstrate its superiority over both base models and larger LLMs in identifying complex vulnerabilities and logical flaws, establishing FineSec as a practical and scalable solution for real-world software security. To facilitate reproducibility, the datasets, source code, and experimental results are made publicly available at: https://github.com/yangxiaoxuan123/FineSec_detect.

Abstract: A core challenge in scientific machine learning, and scientific computing more generally, is modeling continuous phenomena which (in practice) are represented discretely. Machine-learned operators (MLOs) have been introduced as a means to achieve this modeling goal, as this class of architecture can perform inference at arbitrary resolution. In this work, we evaluate whether this architectural innovation is sufficient to perform "zero-shot super-resolution," namely to enable a model to serve inference on higher-resolution data than that on which it was originally trained. We comprehensively evaluate both zero-shot sub-resolution and super-resolution (i.e., multi-resolution) inference in MLOs. We decouple multi-resolution inference into two key behaviors: 1) extrapolation to varying frequency information; and 2) interpolating across varying resolutions. We empirically demonstrate that MLOs fail to do both of these tasks in a zero-shot manner. Consequently, we find MLOs are not able to perform accurate inference at resolutions different from those on which they were trained, and instead they are brittle and susceptible to aliasing. To address these failure modes, we propose a simple, computationally-efficient, and data-driven multi-resolution training protocol that overcomes aliasing and that provides robust multi-resolution generalization.

Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) Algorithm is a recently proposed learning procedure for neural networks that employs two forward passes instead of the traditional forward and backward passes used in backpropagation. However, FF remains largely confined to supervised settings, leaving a gap at domains where learning signals can be yielded more naturally such as RL. In this work, inspired by FF's goodness function using layer activity statistics, we introduce Action-conditioned Root mean squared Q-Functions (ARQ), a novel value estimation method that applies a goodness function and action conditioning for local RL using temporal difference learning. Despite its simplicity and biological grounding, our approach achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art local backprop-free RL methods in the MinAtar and the DeepMind Control Suite benchmarks, while also outperforming algorithms trained with backpropagation on most tasks.

Abstract: We present a risk-aware safety certification method for autonomous, learning enabled control systems. Focusing on two realistic risks, state/input delays and interval matrix uncertainty, we model the neural network (NN) controller with local sector bounds and exploit positivity structure to derive linear, delay-independent certificates that guarantee local exponential stability across admissible uncertainties. To benchmark performance, we adopt and implement a state-of-the-art IQC NN verification pipeline. On representative cases, our positivity-based tests run orders of magnitude faster than SDP-based IQC while certifying regimes the latter cannot-providing scalable safety guarantees that complement risk-aware control.

Abstract: Industrial surface defect detection (SDD) is critical for ensuring product quality and manufacturing reliability. Due to the diverse shapes and sizes of surface defects, SDD faces two main challenges: intraclass difference and interclass similarity. Existing methods primarily utilize manually designed models, which require extensive trial and error and often struggle to address both challenges effectively. To overcome this, we propose AutoNAD, an automated neural architecture design framework for SDD that jointly searches over convolutions, transformers, and multi-layer perceptrons. This hybrid design enables the model to capture both fine-grained local variations and long-range semantic context, addressing the two key challenges while reducing the cost of manual network design. To support efficient training of such a diverse search space, AutoNAD introduces a cross weight sharing strategy, which accelerates supernet convergence and improves subnet performance. Additionally, a searchable multi-level feature aggregation module (MFAM) is integrated to enhance multi-scale feature learning. Beyond detection accuracy, runtime efficiency is essential for industrial deployment. To this end, AutoNAD incorporates a latency-aware prior to guide the selection of efficient architectures. The effectiveness of AutoNAD is validated on three industrial defect datasets and further applied within a defect imaging and detection platform. Code will be available at https://github.com/Yuxi104/AutoNAD.

Abstract: We introduce Heptapod, an image autoregressive model that adheres to the foundational principles of language modeling. Heptapod employs \textbf{causal attention}, \textbf{eliminates reliance on CFG}, and \textbf{eschews the trend of semantic tokenizers}. Our key innovation is \textit{next 2D distribution prediction}: a causal Transformer with reconstruction-focused visual tokenizer, learns to predict the distribution over the entire 2D spatial grid of images at each timestep. This learning objective unifies the sequential modeling of autoregressive framework with the holistic self-supervised learning of masked autoencoding, enabling the model to capture comprehensive image semantics via generative training. On the ImageNet generation benchmark, Heptapod achieves an FID of $2.70$, significantly outperforming previous causal autoregressive approaches. We hope our work inspires a principled rethinking of language modeling on visual signals and beyond.

Abstract: We introduce an incremental summarization system for customer support agents that intelligently determines when to generate concise bullet notes during conversations, reducing agents' context-switching effort and redundant review. Our approach combines a fine-tuned Mixtral-8x7B model for continuous note generation with a DeBERTa-based classifier to filter trivial content. Agent edits refine the online notes generation and regularly inform offline model retraining, closing the agent edits feedback loop. Deployed in production, our system achieved a 3% reduction in case handling time compared to bulk summarization (with reductions of up to 9% in highly complex cases), alongside high agent satisfaction ratings from surveys. These results demonstrate that incremental summarization with continuous feedback effectively enhances summary quality and agent productivity at scale.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation serves as a cornerstone of scene understanding in autonomous driving but continues to face significant challenges under complex conditions such as occlusion. Light field and LiDAR modalities provide complementary visual and spatial cues that are beneficial for robust perception; however, their effective integration is hindered by limited viewpoint diversity and inherent modality discrepancies. To address these challenges, the first multimodal semantic segmentation dataset integrating light field data and point cloud data is proposed. Based on this dataset, we proposed a multi-modal light field point-cloud fusion segmentation network(Mlpfseg), incorporating feature completion and depth perception to segment both camera images and LiDAR point clouds simultaneously. The feature completion module addresses the density mismatch between point clouds and image pixels by performing differential reconstruction of point-cloud feature maps, enhancing the fusion of these modalities. The depth perception module improves the segmentation of occluded objects by reinforcing attention scores for better occlusion awareness. Our method outperforms image-only segmentation by 1.71 Mean Intersection over Union(mIoU) and point cloud-only segmentation by 2.38 mIoU, demonstrating its effectiveness.

<title>Learning to Rewrite Prompts for Bootstrapping LLMs on Downstream Tasks</title>

Abstract: In recent years, the growing interest in Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced prompt engineering, transitioning from manual design to model-based optimization. Prompts for LLMs generally comprise two components: the \textit{instruction}, which defines the task or objective, and the \textit{input}, which is tailored to the instruction type. In natural language generation (NLG) tasks such as machine translation, the \textit{input} component is particularly critical, while the \textit{instruction} component tends to be concise. Existing prompt engineering methods primarily focus on optimizing the \textit{instruction} component for general tasks, often requiring large-parameter LLMs as auxiliary tools. However, these approaches exhibit limited applicability for tasks like machine translation, where the \textit{input} component plays a more pivotal role. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a novel prompt optimization method specifically designed for machine translation tasks. The proposed approach employs a small-parameter model trained using a back-translation-based strategy, significantly reducing training overhead for single-task optimization while delivering highly effective performance. With certain adaptations, this method can also be extended to other downstream tasks.

Abstract: Systematic reviews are a standard practice for summarizing the state of evidence in software engineering. Conducting systematic reviews is laborious, especially during the screening or study selection phase, where the number of papers can be overwhelming. During this phase, papers are assessed against inclusion and exclusion criteria based on their titles and abstracts. Recent research has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can perform title-abstract screening at a level comparable to that of a master's student. While LLMs cannot be fully trusted, they can help, for example, in Rapid Reviews, which try to expedite the review process. Building on recent research, we developed AiSysRev, an LLM-based screening tool implemented as a web application running in a Docker container. The tool accepts a CSV file containing paper titles and abstracts. Users specify inclusion and exclusion criteria. One can use multiple LLMs for screening via OpenRouter. AiSysRev supports both zero-shot and few-shot screening, and also allows for manual screening through interfaces that display LLM results as guidance for human reviewers.We conducted a trial study with 137 papers using the tool. Our findings indicate that papers can be classified into four categories: Easy Includes, Easy Excludes, Boundary Includes, and Boundary Excludes. The Boundary cases, where LLMs are prone to errors, highlight the need for human intervention. While LLMs do not replace human judgment in systematic reviews, they can significantly reduce the burden of assessing large volumes of scientific literature.

<title>Dual Goal Representations</title>

Abstract: In this work, we introduce dual goal representations for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL). A dual goal representation characterizes a state by "the set of temporal distances from all other states"; in other words, it encodes a state through its relations to every other state, measured by temporal distance. This representation provides several appealing theoretical properties. First, it depends only on the intrinsic dynamics of the environment and is invariant to the original state representation. Second, it contains provably sufficient information to recover an optimal goal-reaching policy, while being able to filter out exogenous noise. Based on this concept, we develop a practical goal representation learning method that can be combined with any existing GCRL algorithm. Through diverse experiments on the OGBench task suite, we empirically show that dual goal representations consistently improve offline goal-reaching performance across 20 state- and pixel-based tasks.

<title>Scaling LLM Multi-turn RL with End-to-end Summarization-based Context Management</title>

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language model (LLM) agents for long-horizon multi-turn tool use, where context length quickly becomes a fundamental bottleneck. Existing RL pipelines can suffer from degraded instruction following, excessive rollout costs, and most importantly, strict context limits. To address these challenges, we introduce summarization-based context management to training. In specific, it periodically compresses the tool using history by LLM-generated summaries that retain task-relevant information to keep a compact context while enabling the agent to scale beyond the fixed context window. Building on this formulation, we derive a policy gradient representation that seamlessly enables standard LLM RL infrastructures to optimize both tool-use behaviors as well as summarization strategies in an end-to-end fashion. We instantiate this framework with \underline{SU}mmarization augmented \underline{P}olicy \underline{O}ptimization (\texttt{SUPO}), an LLM RL algorithm that enables long-horizon training beyond a fixed context limit. Experiments on interactive function calling and searching tasks demonstrate that \texttt{SUPO} significantly improves the success rate while maintaining the same or even lower working context length compared to baselines. We also demonstrate that for complex searching tasks, \texttt{SUPO} can further improve the evaluation performance when scaling test-time maximum round of summarization beyond that of training time. Our results establish summarization-based context management as a principled and scalable approach for training RL agents beyond a fixed context length limit.

<title>Are LLMs Reliable Rankers? Rank Manipulation via Two-Stage Token Optimization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.06732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as rerankers in information retrieval, yet their ranking behavior can be steered by small, natural-sounding prompts. To expose this vulnerability, we present Rank Anything First (RAF), a two-stage token optimization method that crafts concise textual perturbations to consistently promote a target item in LLM-generated rankings while remaining hard to detect. Stage 1 uses Greedy Coordinate Gradient to shortlist candidate tokens at the current position by combining the gradient of the rank-target with a readability score; Stage 2 evaluates those candidates under exact ranking and readability losses using an entropy-based dynamic weighting scheme, and selects a token via temperature-controlled sampling. RAF generates ranking-promoting prompts token-by-token, guided by dual objectives: maximizing ranking effectiveness and preserving linguistic naturalness. Experiments across multiple LLMs show that RAF significantly boosts the rank of target items using naturalistic language, with greater robustness than existing methods in both promoting target items and maintaining naturalness. These findings underscore a critical security implication: LLM-based reranking is inherently susceptible to adversarial manipulation, raising new challenges for the trustworthiness and robustness of modern retrieval systems. Our code is available at: https://github.com/glad-lab/RAF.

Abstract: Digital humanities scholars increasingly use Large Language Models for historical document digitization, yet lack appropriate evaluation frameworks for LLM-based OCR. Traditional metrics fail to capture temporal biases and period-specific errors crucial for historical corpus creation. We present an evaluation methodology for LLM-based historical OCR, addressing contamination risks and systematic biases in diplomatic transcription. Using 18th-century Russian Civil font texts, we introduce novel metrics including Historical Character Preservation Rate (HCPR) and Archaic Insertion Rate (AIR), alongside protocols for contamination control and stability testing. We evaluate 12 multimodal LLMs, finding that Gemini and Qwen models outperform traditional OCR while exhibiting over-historicization: inserting archaic characters from incorrect historical periods. Post-OCR correction degrades rather than improves performance. Our methodology provides digital humanities practitioners with guidelines for model selection and quality assessment in historical corpus digitization.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for quantitative modeling and analysis to understand real-world disease dynamics. In particular, post hoc analyses using compartmental models offer valuable insights into the effectiveness of public health interventions, such as vaccination strategies and containment policies. However, such compartmental models like SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) often face limitations in directly incorporating noisy observational data. In this work, we employ Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve the inverse problem of the SIR model using infection data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). Our main contribution is a fine-grained, spatio-temporal analysis of COVID-19 dynamics across all German federal states over a three-year period. We estimate state-specific transmission and recovery parameters and time-varying reproduction number (R_t) to track the pandemic progression. The results highlight strong variations in transmission behavior across regions, revealing correlations with vaccination uptake and temporal patterns associated with major pandemic phases. Our findings demonstrate the utility of PINNs in localized, long-term epidemiological modeling.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode substantial factual knowledge, yet measuring and systematizing this knowledge remains challenging. Converting it into structured format, for example through recursive extraction approaches such as the GPTKB methodology (Hu et al., 2025b), is still underexplored. Key open questions include whether such extraction can terminate, whether its outputs are reproducible, and how robust they are to variations. We systematically study LLM knowledge materialization using miniGPTKBs (domain-specific, tractable subcrawls), analyzing termination, reproducibility, and robustness across three categories of metrics: yield, lexical similarity, and semantic similarity. We experiment with four variations (seed, language, randomness, model) and three illustrative domains (from history, entertainment, and finance). Our findings show (i) high termination rates, though model-dependent; (ii) mixed reproducibility; and (iii) robustness that varies by perturbation type: high for seeds and temperature, lower for languages and models. These results suggest that LLM knowledge materialization can reliably surface core knowledge, while also revealing important limitations.

Abstract: Extreme amodal detection is the task of inferring the 2D location of objects that are not fully visible in the input image but are visible within an expanded field-of-view. This differs from amodal detection, where the object is partially visible within the input image, but is occluded. In this paper, we consider the sub-problem of face detection, since this class provides motivating applications involving safety and privacy, but do not tailor our method specifically to this class. Existing approaches rely on image sequences so that missing detections may be interpolated from surrounding frames or make use of generative models to sample possible completions. In contrast, we consider the single-image task and propose a more efficient, sample-free approach that makes use of the contextual cues from the image to infer the presence of unseen faces. We design a heatmap-based extreme amodal object detector that addresses the problem of efficiently predicting a lot (the out-of-frame region) from a little (the image) with a selective coarse-to-fine decoder. Our method establishes strong results for this new task, even outperforming less efficient generative approaches.

<title>FURINA: A Fully Customizable Role-Playing Benchmark via Scalable Multi-Agent Collaboration Pipeline</title>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance in role-playing (RP) tasks, existing benchmarks quickly become obsolete due to their narrow scope, outdated interaction paradigms, and limited adaptability across diverse application scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce FURINA-Builder, a novel multi-agent collaboration pipeline that automatically constructs fully customizable RP benchmarks at any scale. It enables evaluation of arbitrary characters across diverse scenarios and prompt formats, as the first benchmark builder in RP area for adaptable assessment. FURINA-Builder simulates dialogues between a test character and other characters drawn from a well-constructed character-scene pool, while an LLM judge selects fine-grained evaluation dimensions and adjusts the test character's responses into final test utterances. Using this pipeline, we build FURINA-Bench, a new comprehensive role-playing benchmark featuring both established and synthesized test characters, each assessed with dimension-specific evaluation criteria. Human evaluation and preliminary separability analysis justify our pipeline and benchmark design. We conduct extensive evaluations of cutting-edge LLMs and find that o3 and DeepSeek-R1 achieve the best performance on English and Chinese RP tasks, respectively. Across all models, established characters consistently outperform synthesized ones, with reasoning capabilities further amplifying this disparity. Interestingly, we observe that model scale does not monotonically reduce hallucinations. More critically, for reasoning LLMs, we uncover a novel trade-off: reasoning improves RP performance but simultaneously increases RP hallucinations. This trade-off extends to a broader Pareto frontier between RP performance and reliability for all LLMs. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of FURINA-Builder and the challenge posed by FURINA-Bench.

Abstract: In recent years, attention-like mechanisms have been used to great success in the space of large language models, unlocking scaling potential to a previously unthinkable extent. "Attention Is All You Need" famously claims RNN cells are not needed in conjunction with attention. We challenge this view. In this paper, we point to existing proofs that architectures with fully parallelizable forward or backward passes cannot represent classes of problems specifically interesting for long-running agentic tasks. We further conjecture a critical time t beyond which non-recurrence-complete models fail to aggregate inputs correctly, with concrete implications for agentic systems (e.g., software engineering agents). To address this, we introduce a recurrence-complete architecture and train it on GitHub-derived action sequences. Loss follows a power law in the trained sequence length while the parameter count remains fixed. Moreover, longer-sequence training always amortizes its linearly increasing wall-time cost, yielding lower loss as a function of wall time.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer architectures offer strengths for modeling temporal data: CNNs excel at capturing local patterns and translational invariances, while transformers effectively model long-range dependencies via self-attention. This paper proposes a hybrid architecture integrating convolutional feature extraction with a temporal fusion transformer (TFT) backbone to enhance multivariate time series forecasting. The CNN module first applies a hierarchy of one-dimensional convolutional layers to distill salient local patterns from raw input sequences, reducing noise and dimensionality. The resulting feature maps are then fed into the TFT, which applies multi-head attention to capture both short- and long-term dependencies and to weigh relevant covariates adaptively. We evaluate the CNN-TFT on a hydroelectric natural flow time series dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that CNN-TFT outperforms well-established deep learning models, with a mean absolute percentage error of up to 2.2%. The explainability of the model is obtained by a proposed Shapley additive explanations with multi-head attention weights (SHAP-MHAW). Our novel architecture, named CNN-TFT-SHAP-MHAW, is promising for applications requiring high-fidelity, multivariate time series forecasts, being available for future analysis at https://github.com/SFStefenon/CNN-TFT-SHAP-MHAW .

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across diverse application domains. Recent work has explored Multi-LLM Agent Debate (MAD) as a way to enhance performance by enabling multiple LLMs to discuss and refine responses iteratively. Nevertheless, existing MAD methods predominantly focus on utilizing external structures, such as debate graphs, using LLM-as-a-Judge, while neglecting the application of self signals, such as token logits and attention, that arise during generation. This omission leads to redundant computation and potential performance degradation. In this paper, we shift the focus to the self signals of multi-LLM debate and introduce a Self-Signals Driven Multi-LLM Debate (SID), which leverages two types of self-signals: model-level confidence and token-level semantic focus, to adaptively guide the debate process. Our approach enables high-confidence agents to exit early at the model level and compress the redundant debate contents based on the attention mechanism. We evaluate our method on various LLMs and Multimodal LLMs across multiple challenging benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only outperforms existing MAD techniques in accuracy but also reduces token consumption, highlighting the effectiveness of utilizing self signals in enhancing both the performance and efficiency of multi-agent debate systems. Our code will be available at~\href{https://github.com/xuhang2019/SID}{\texttt{https://github.com/xuhang2019/SID}}.

<title>Enhancing Bankruptcy Prediction of Banks through Advanced Machine Learning Techniques: An Innovative Approach and Analysis</title>

Abstract: Context: Financial system stability is determined by the condition of the banking system. A bank failure can destroy the stability of the financial system, as banks are subject to systemic risk, affecting not only individual banks but also segments or the entire financial system. Calculating the probability of a bank going bankrupt is one way to ensure the banking system is safe and sound. Existing literature and limitations: Statistical models, such as Altman's Z-Score, are one of the common techniques for developing a bankruptcy prediction model. However, statistical methods rely on rigid and sometimes irrelevant assumptions, which can result in low forecast accuracy. New approaches are necessary. Objective of the research: Bankruptcy models are developed using machine learning techniques, such as logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and support vector machines (SVM). According to several studies, machine learning is also more accurate and effective than statistical methods for categorising and forecasting banking risk management. Present Research: The commercial bank data are derived from the annual financial statements of 44 active banks and 21 bankrupt banks in Turkey from 1994 to 2004, and the rural bank data are derived from the quarterly financial reports of 43 active and 43 bankrupt rural banks in Indonesia between 2013 and 2019. Five rural banks in Indonesia have also been selected to demonstrate the feasibility of analysing bank bankruptcy trends. Findings and implications: The results of the research experiments show that RF can forecast data from commercial banks with a 90% accuracy rate. Furthermore, the three machine learning methods proposed accurately predict the likelihood of rural bank bankruptcy. Contribution and Conclusion: The proposed innovative machine learning approach help to implement policies that reduce the costs of bankruptcy.

Abstract: With increasing processing power, deploying AI models for remote sensing directly onboard satellites is becoming feasible. However, new constraints arise, mainly when using raw, unprocessed sensor data instead of preprocessed ground-based products. While current solutions primarily rely on preprocessed sensor images, few approaches directly leverage raw data. This study investigates the effects of utilising raw data on deep learning models for object detection and classification tasks. We introduce a simulation workflow to generate raw-like products from high-resolution L1 imagery, enabling systemic evaluation. Two object detection models (YOLOv11s and YOLOX-S) are trained on both raw and L1 datasets, and their performance is compared using standard detection metrics and explainability tools. Results indicate that while both models perform similarly at low to medium confidence thresholds, the model trained on raw data struggles with object boundary identification at high confidence levels. It suggests that adapting AI architectures with improved contouring methods can enhance object detection on raw images, improving onboard AI for remote sensing.

Abstract: AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) is computationally expensive for large-scale power systems, with conventional solvers requiring prohibitive solution times. Machine learning approaches offer computational speedups but struggle with scalability and topology adaptability without expensive retraining. To enable scalability across grid sizes and adaptability to topology changes, we propose a Hybrid Heterogeneous Message Passing Neural Network (HH-MPNN). HH-MPNN models buses, generators, loads, shunts, transmission lines and transformers as distinct node or edge types, combined with a scalable transformer model for handling long-range dependencies. On grids from 14 to 2,000 buses, HH-MPNN achieves less than 1% optimality gap on default topologies. Applied zero-shot to thousands of unseen topologies, HH-MPNN achieves less than 3% optimality gap despite training only on default topologies. Pre-training on smaller grids also improves results on a larger grid. Computational speedups reach 1,000x to 10,000x compared to interior point solvers. These results advance practical, generalizable machine learning for real-time power system operations.

Abstract: We consider image transmission via deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) over multi-hop additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels by training a DeepJSCC encoder-decoder pair with a pre-trained deep hash distillation (DHD) module to semantically cluster images, facilitating security-oriented applications through enhanced semantic consistency and improving the perceptual reconstruction quality. We train the DeepJSCC module to both reduce mean square error (MSE) and minimize cosine distance between DHD hashes of source and reconstructed images. Significantly improved perceptual quality as a result of semantic alignment is illustrated for different multi-hop settings, for which classical DeepJSCC may suffer from noise accumulation, measured by the learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) metric.

Abstract: The integration of multi-omics single-cell data remains challenging due to high-dimensionality and complex inter-modality relationships. To address this, we introduce MoRE-GNN (Multi-omics Relational Edge Graph Neural Network), a heterogeneous graph autoencoder that combines graph convolution and attention mechanisms to dynamically construct relational graphs directly from data. Evaluations on six publicly available datasets demonstrate that MoRE-GNN captures biologically meaningful relationships and outperforms existing methods, particularly in settings with strong inter-modality correlations. Furthermore, the learned representations allow for accurate downstream cross-modal predictions. While performance may vary with dataset complexity, MoRE-GNN offers an adaptive, scalable and interpretable framework for advancing multi-omics integration.

<title>Multi-Dimensional Autoscaling of Stream Processing Services on Edge Devices</title>

Abstract: Edge devices have limited resources, which inevitably leads to situations where stream processing services cannot satisfy their needs. While existing autoscaling mechanisms focus entirely on resource scaling, Edge devices require alternative ways to sustain the Service Level Objectives (SLOs) of competing services. To address these issues, we introduce a Multi-dimensional Autoscaling Platform (MUDAP) that supports fine-grained vertical scaling across both service- and resource-level dimensions. MUDAP supports service-specific scaling tailored to available parameters, e.g., scale data quality or model size for a particular service. To optimize the execution across services, we present a scaling agent based on Regression Analysis of Structural Knowledge (RASK). The RASK agent efficiently explores the solution space and learns a continuous regression model of the processing environment for inferring optimal scaling actions. We compared our approach with two autoscalers, the Kubernetes VPA and a reinforcement learning agent, for scaling up to 9 services on a single Edge device. Our results showed that RASK can infer an accurate regression model in merely 20 iterations (i.e., observe 200s of processing). By increasingly adding elasticity dimensions, RASK sustained the highest request load with 28% less SLO violations, compared to baselines.

Abstract: With the increasing use of RetrievalAugmented Generation (RAG), strong retrieval models have become more important than ever. In healthcare, multimodal retrieval models that combine information from both text and images offer major advantages for many downstream tasks such as question answering, cross-modal retrieval, and multimodal summarization, since medical data often includes both formats. However, there is currently no standard benchmark to evaluate how well these models perform in medical settings. To address this gap, we introduce M3Retrieve, a Multimodal Medical Retrieval Benchmark. M3Retrieve, spans 5 domains,16 medical fields, and 4 distinct tasks, with over 1.2 Million text documents and 164K multimodal queries, all collected under approved licenses. We evaluate leading multimodal retrieval models on this benchmark to explore the challenges specific to different medical specialities and to understand their impact on retrieval performance. By releasing M3Retrieve, we aim to enable systematic evaluation, foster model innovation, and accelerate research toward building more capable and reliable multimodal retrieval systems for medical applications. The dataset and the baselines code are available in this github page https://github.com/AkashGhosh/M3Retrieve.

Abstract: Constrained clustering integrates domain knowledge through pairwise constraints. However, existing deep constrained clustering (DCC) methods are either limited by anchors inherent in end-to-end modeling or struggle with learning discriminative Euclidean embedding, restricting their scalability and real-world applicability. To avoid their respective pitfalls, we propose a novel angular constraint embedding approach for DCC, termed SpherePair. Using the SpherePair loss with a geometric formulation, our method faithfully encodes pairwise constraints and leads to embeddings that are clustering-friendly in angular space, effectively separating representation learning from clustering. SpherePair preserves pairwise relations without conflict, removes the need to specify the exact number of clusters, generalizes to unseen data, enables rapid inference of the number of clusters, and is supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees. Comparative evaluations with state-of-the-art DCC methods on diverse benchmarks, along with empirical validation of theoretical insights, confirm its superior performance, scalability, and overall real-world effectiveness. Code is available at \href{https://github.com/spherepaircc/SpherePairCC/tree/main}{our repository}.

Abstract: Concerns over the potential over-pathologization of generative AI (GenAI) use and the lack of conceptual clarity surrounding GenAI addiction call for empirical tools and theoretical refinement. This study developed and validated the PUGenAIS-9 (Problematic Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence Scale-9 items) and examined whether PUGenAIS reflects addiction-like patterns under the Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) framework. Using samples from China and the United States (N = 1,508), we conducted confirmatory factor analysis and identified a robust 31-item structure across nine IGD-based dimensions. We then derived the PUGenAIS-9 by selecting the highest-loading items from each dimension and validated its structure in an independent sample (N = 1,426). Measurement invariance tests confirmed its stability across nationality and gender. Person-centered (latent profile analysis) and variable-centered (network analysis) approaches found that PUGenAIS matches the traits of the emotionally vulnerable subtype of IGD, not the competence-based kind. These results support using PUGenAIS-9 to identify problematic GenAI use and show the need to rethink digital addiction with an ICD (infrastructures, content, and device) model. This keeps addiction research responsive to new media while avoiding over-pathologizing.

Abstract: Realistic traffic simulation is critical for the development of autonomous driving systems and urban mobility planning, yet existing imitation learning approaches often fail to model realistic traffic behaviors. Behavior cloning suffers from covariate shift, while Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) is notoriously unstable in multi-agent settings. We identify a key source of this instability: irrelevant interaction misguidance, where a discriminator penalizes an ego vehicle's realistic behavior due to unrealistic interactions among its neighbors. To address this, we propose Decomposed Multi-agent GAIL (DecompGAIL), which explicitly decomposes realism into ego-map and ego-neighbor components, filtering out misleading neighbor: neighbor and neighbor: map interactions. We further introduce a social PPO objective that augments ego rewards with distance-weighted neighborhood rewards, encouraging overall realism across agents. Integrated into a lightweight SMART-based backbone, DecompGAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WOMD Sim Agents 2025 benchmark.

<title>LongRM: Revealing and Unlocking the Context Boundary of Reward Modeling</title>

Abstract: Reward model (RM) plays a pivotal role in aligning large language model (LLM) with human preferences. As real-world applications increasingly involve long history trajectories, e.g., LLM agent, it becomes indispensable to evaluate whether a model's responses are not only high-quality but also grounded in and consistent with the provided context. Yet, current RMs remain confined to short-context settings and primarily focus on response-level attributes (e.g., safety or helpfulness), while largely neglecting the critical dimension of long context-response consistency. In this work, we introduce Long-RewardBench, a benchmark specifically designed for long-context RM evaluation, featuring both Pairwise Comparison and Best-of-N tasks. Our preliminary study reveals that even state-of-the-art generative RMs exhibit significant fragility in long-context scenarios, failing to maintain context-aware preference judgments. Motivated by the analysis of failure patterns observed in model outputs, we propose a general multi-stage training strategy that effectively scales arbitrary models into robust Long-context RMs (LongRMs). Experiments show that our approach not only substantially improves performance on long-context evaluation but also preserves strong short-context capability. Notably, our 8B LongRM outperforms much larger 70B-scale baselines and matches the performance of the proprietary Gemini 2.5 Pro model.

Abstract: We present a method that models the evolution of an unbounded number of time series clusters by switching among an unknown number of regimes with linear dynamics. We develop a Bayesian non-parametric approach using a hierarchical Dirichlet process as a prior on the parameters of a Switching Linear Dynamical System and a Gaussian process prior to model the statistical variations in amplitude and temporal alignment within each cluster. By modeling the evolution of time series patterns, the method avoids unnecessary proliferation of clusters in a principled manner. We perform inference by formulating a variational lower bound for off-line and on-line scenarios, enabling efficient learning through optimization. We illustrate the versatility and effectiveness of the approach through several case studies of electrocardiogram analysis using publicly available databases.

<title>Expressive and Scalable Quantum Fusion for Multimodal Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.06938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to introduce a quantum fusion mechanism for multimodal learning and to establish its theoretical and empirical potential. The proposed method, called the Quantum Fusion Layer (QFL), replaces classical fusion schemes with a hybrid quantum-classical procedure that uses parameterized quantum circuits to learn entangled feature interactions without requiring exponential parameter growth. Supported by quantum signal processing principles, the quantum component efficiently represents high-order polynomial interactions across modalities with linear parameter scaling, and we provide a separation example between QFL and low-rank tensor-based methods that highlights potential quantum query advantages. In simulation, QFL consistently outperforms strong classical baselines on small but diverse multimodal tasks, with particularly marked improvements in high-modality regimes. These results suggest that QFL offers a fundamentally new and scalable approach to multimodal fusion that merits deeper exploration on larger systems.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.06949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, while foundational to modern Transformer architectures, suffers from a critical inefficiency: it frequently allocates substantial attention to redundant or noisy context. Differential Attention addressed this by using subtractive attention maps for signal and noise, but its required balanced head allocation imposes rigid constraints on representational flexibility and scalability.
  To overcome this, we propose Grouped Differential Attention (GDA), a novel approach that introduces unbalanced head allocation between signal-preserving and noise-control groups. GDA significantly enhances signal focus by strategically assigning more heads to signal extraction and fewer to noise-control, stabilizing the latter through controlled repetition (akin to GQA). This design achieves stronger signal fidelity with minimal computational overhead. We further extend this principle to group-differentiated growth, a scalable strategy that selectively replicates only the signal-focused heads, thereby ensuring efficient capacity expansion.
  Through large-scale pretraining and continual training experiments, we demonstrate that moderate imbalance ratios in GDA yield substantial improvements in generalization and stability compared to symmetric baselines. Our results collectively establish that ratio-aware head allocation and selective expansion offer an effective and practical path toward designing scalable, computation-efficient Transformer architectures.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress, ASR evaluation remains saturated with short-form English, and efficiency is rarely reported. We present the Open ASR Leaderboard, a fully reproducible benchmark and interactive leaderboard comparing 60+ open-source and proprietary systems across 11 datasets, including dedicated multilingual and long-form tracks. We standardize text normalization and report both word error rate (WER) and inverse real-time factor (RTFx), enabling fair accuracy-efficiency comparisons. For English transcription, Conformer encoders paired with LLM decoders achieve the best average WER but are slower, while CTC and TDT decoders deliver much better RTFx, making them attractive for long-form and offline use. Whisper-derived encoders fine-tuned for English improve accuracy but often trade off multilingual coverage. All code and dataset loaders are open-sourced to support transparent, extensible evaluation.

Abstract: Math word problems (MWPs) are critical K-12 educational tools, and customizing them to students' interests and ability levels can increase learning outcomes. However, teachers struggle to find time to customize MWPs for each student given large class sizes and increasing burnout. We propose that LLMs can support math education by generating MWPs customized to student interests and math education standards. To this end, we use a joint human expert-LLM judge approach to evaluate over 11,000 MWPs generated by open and closed LLMs and develop the first teacher-annotated dataset for standards-aligned educational MWP generation. We show the value of our data by using it to train a 12B open model that matches the performance of larger and more capable open models. We also use our teacher-annotated data to train a text classifier that enables a 30B open LLM to outperform existing closed baselines without any training. Next, we show our models' MWPs are more similar to human-written MWPs than those from existing models. We conclude by conducting the first study of customized LLM-generated MWPs with grade school students, finding they perform similarly on our models' MWPs relative to human-written MWPs but consistently prefer our customized MWPs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Text-to-3D modeling have shown significant potential for the creation of 3D content. However, due to the complex geometric shapes of objects in the natural world, generating 3D content remains a challenging task. Current methods either leverage 2D diffusion priors to recover 3D geometry, or train the model directly based on specific 3D representations. In this paper, we propose a novel method named DirectGaussian, which focuses on generating the surfaces of 3D objects represented by surfels. In DirectGaussian, we utilize conditional text generation models and the surface of a 3D object is rendered by 2D Gaussian splatting with multi-view normal and texture priors. For multi-view geometric consistency problems, DirectGaussian incorporates curvature constraints on the generated surface during optimization process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework is capable of achieving diverse and high-fidelity 3D content creation.

Abstract: The online construction of vectorized high-definition (HD) maps is a cornerstone of modern autonomous driving systems. State-of-the-art approaches, particularly those based on the DETR framework, formulate this as an instance detection problem. However, their reliance on independent, learnable object queries results in a predominantly local query perspective, neglecting the inherent global representation within HD maps. In this work, we propose \textbf{MapGR} (\textbf{G}lobal \textbf{R}epresentation learning for HD \textbf{Map} construction), an architecture designed to learn and utilize a global representations from queries. Our method introduces two synergistic modules: a Global Representation Learning (GRL) module, which encourages the distribution of all queries to better align with the global map through a carefully designed holistic segmentation task, and a Global Representation Guidance (GRG) module, which endows each individual query with explicit, global-level contextual information to facilitate its optimization. Evaluations on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets validate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating substantial improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP) compared to leading baselines.

Abstract: There are very few SotA deception systems based on Large Language Models. The existing ones are limited only to simulating one type of service, mainly SSH shells. These systems - but also the deception technologies not based on LLMs - lack an extensive evaluation that includes human attackers. Generative AI has recently become a valuable asset for cybersecurity researchers and practitioners, and the field of cyber-deception is no exception. Researchers have demonstrated how LLMs can be leveraged to create realistic-looking honeytokens, fake users, and even simulated systems that can be used as honeypots. This paper presents an AI-based deception framework called VelLMes, which can simulate multiple protocols and services such as SSH Linux shell, MySQL, POP3, and HTTP. All of these can be deployed and used as honeypots, thus VelLMes offers a variety of choices for deception design based on the users' needs. VelLMes is designed to be attacked by humans, so interactivity and realism are key for its performance. We evaluate the generative capabilities and the deception capabilities. Generative capabilities were evaluated using unit tests for LLMs. The results of the unit tests show that, with careful prompting, LLMs can produce realistic-looking responses, with some LLMs having a 100% passing rate. In the case of the SSH Linux shell, we evaluated deception capabilities with 89 human attackers. The results showed that about 30% of the attackers thought that they were interacting with a real system when they were assigned an LLM-based honeypot. Lastly, we deployed 10 instances of the SSH Linux shell honeypot on the Internet to capture real-life attacks. Analysis of these attacks showed us that LLM honeypots simulating Linux shells can perform well against unstructured and unexpected attacks on the Internet, responding correctly to most of the issued commands.

Abstract: Many users interact with AI tools like ChatGPT using a mental model that treats the system as human-like, which we call Model H. According to goal-setting theory, increased specificity in goals should reduce performance variance. If Model H holds, then prompting a chatbot with more detailed instructions should lead to more consistent evaluation behavior.
  This paper tests that assumption through a controlled experiment in which ChatGPT evaluated 29 student submissions using four prompts with increasing specificity. We measured consistency using intra-rater reliability (Cohen's Kappa) across repeated runs.
  Contrary to expectations, performance did not improve consistently with increased prompt specificity, and performance variance remained largely unchanged. These findings challenge the assumption that LLMs behave like human evaluators and highlight the need for greater robustness and improved input integration in future model development.

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) depends heavily on the availability of high-quality post-training data, particularly instruction-tuning and preference-based examples. Existing open-source datasets, however, often lack multilingual coverage, cultural grounding, and suffer from task diversity gaps that are especially pronounced for Indian languages. We introduce a human-in-the-loop pipeline that combines translations with synthetic expansion to produce reliable and diverse Indic post-training data. Using this pipeline, we curate two datasets: Pragyaan-IT (22.5K) and Pragyaan-Align (100K) across 10 Indian languages covering 13 broad and 56 sub-categories, leveraging 57 diverse datasets. Our dataset protocol incorporates several often-overlooked dimensions and emphasize task diversity, multi-turn dialogue, instruction fidelity, safety alignment, and preservation of cultural nuance, providing a foundation for more inclusive and effective multilingual LLMs.

Abstract: Transformers excel at sequence modeling but face quadratic complexity, while linear attention offers improved efficiency but often compromises recall accuracy over long contexts. In this work, we introduce Native Hybrid Attention (NHA), a novel hybrid architecture of linear and full attention that integrates both intra \& inter-layer hybridization into a unified layer design. NHA maintains long-term context in key-value slots updated by a linear RNN, and augments them with short-term tokens from a sliding window. A single \texttt{softmax attention} operation is then applied over all keys and values, enabling per-token and per-head context-dependent weighting without requiring additional fusion parameters. The inter-layer behavior is controlled through a single hyperparameter, the sliding window size, which allows smooth adjustment between purely linear and full attention while keeping all layers structurally uniform. Experimental results show that NHA surpasses Transformers and other hybrid baselines on recall-intensive and commonsense reasoning tasks. Furthermore, pretrained LLMs can be structurally hybridized with NHA, achieving competitive accuracy while delivering significant efficiency gains. Code is available at https://github.com/JusenD/NHA.

Abstract: Machine unlearning is critical for enforcing data deletion rights like the "right to be forgotten." As a decentralized paradigm, Federated Learning (FL) also requires unlearning, but realistic implementations face two major challenges. First, fairness in Federated Unlearning (FU) is often overlooked. Exact unlearning methods typically force all clients into costly retraining, even those uninvolved. Approximate approaches, using gradient ascent or distillation, make coarse interventions that can unfairly degrade performance for clients with only retained data. Second, most FU evaluations rely on synthetic data assumptions (IID/non-IID) that ignore real-world heterogeneity. These unrealistic benchmarks obscure the true impact of unlearning and limit the applicability of current methods. We first conduct a comprehensive benchmark of existing FU methods under realistic data heterogeneity and fairness conditions. We then propose a novel, fairness-aware FU approach, Federated Cross-Client-Constrains Unlearning (FedCCCU), to explicitly address both challenges. FedCCCU offers a practical and scalable solution for real-world FU. Experimental results show that existing methods perform poorly in realistic settings, while our approach consistently outperforms them.

Abstract: LLMs are remarkable artifacts that have revolutionized a range of NLP and AI tasks. A significant contributor is their factual knowledge, which, to date, remains poorly understood, and is usually analyzed from biased samples. In this paper, we take a deep tour into the factual knowledge (or beliefs) of a frontier LLM, based on GPTKB v1.5 (Hu et al., 2025a), a recursively elicited set of 100 million beliefs of one of the strongest currently available frontier LLMs, GPT-4.1. We find that the models' factual knowledge differs quite significantly from established knowledge bases, and that its accuracy is significantly lower than indicated by previous benchmarks. We also find that inconsistency, ambiguity and hallucinations are major issues, shedding light on future research opportunities concerning factual LLM knowledge.

Abstract: Molecular representation learning plays a crucial role in advancing applications such as drug discovery and material design. Existing work leverages 2D and 3D modalities of molecular information for pre-training, aiming to capture comprehensive structural and geometric insights. However, these methods require paired 2D and 3D molecular data to train the model effectively and prevent it from collapsing into a single modality, posing limitations in scenarios where a certain modality is unavailable or computationally expensive to generate. To overcome this limitation, we propose FlexMol, a flexible molecule pre-training framework that learns unified molecular representations while supporting single-modality input. Specifically, inspired by the unified structure in vision-language models, our approach employs separate models for 2D and 3D molecular data, leverages parameter sharing to improve computational efficiency, and utilizes a decoder to generate features for the missing modality. This enables a multistage continuous learning process where both modalities contribute collaboratively during training, while ensuring robustness when only one modality is available during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlexMol achieves superior performance across a wide range of molecular property prediction tasks, and we also empirically demonstrate its effectiveness with incomplete data.

Abstract: Despite their remarkable natural language understanding capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been underutilized for retrieval tasks. We present Search-R3, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by adapting LLMs to generate search embeddings as a direct output of their reasoning process. Our approach exploits LLMs' chain-of-thought capabilities, allowing them to produce more effective embeddings by reasoning step-by-step through complex semantic analyses. We implement this through three complementary mechanisms. (1) a supervised learning stage enables the model's ability to produce quality embeddings, (2) a reinforcement learning (RL) methodology that optimizes embedding generation alongside reasoning, and (3) a specialized RL environment that efficiently handles evolving embedding representations without requiring complete corpus re-encoding at each training iteration. Our extensive evaluations on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Search-R3 significantly outperforms prior methods by unifying the reasoning and embedding generation processes. This integrated post-training approach represents a substantial advancement in handling complex knowledge-intensive tasks that require both sophisticated reasoning and effective information retrieval.

Abstract: This work investigates how semantics influence localisation performance and robustness in a learned self-supervised, contrastive semantic localisation framework. After training a localisation network on both original and perturbed maps, we conduct a thorough post-hoc introspection analysis to probe whether the model filters environmental noise and prioritises distinctive landmarks over routine clutter. We validate various interpretability methods and present a comparative reliability analysis. Integrated gradients and Attention Weights consistently emerge as the most reliable probes of learned behaviour. A semantic class ablation further reveals an implicit weighting in which frequent objects are often down-weighted. Overall, the results indicate that the model learns noise-robust, semantically salient relations about place definition, thereby enabling explainable registration under challenging visual and structural variations.

<title>LuxInstruct: A Cross-Lingual Instruction Tuning Dataset For Luxembourgish</title>

Abstract: Instruction tuning has become a key technique for enhancing the performance of large language models, enabling them to better follow human prompts. However, low-resource languages such as Luxembourgish face severe limitations due to the lack of high-quality instruction datasets. Traditional reliance on machine translation often introduces semantic misalignment and cultural inaccuracies. In this work, we address these challenges by creating a cross-lingual instruction tuning dataset for Luxembourgish, without resorting to machine-generated translations into it. Instead, by leveraging aligned data from English, French, and German, we build a high-quality dataset that preserves linguistic and cultural nuances. We provide evidence that cross-lingual instruction tuning not only improves representational alignment across languages but also the model's generative capabilities in Luxembourgish. This highlights how cross-lingual data curation can avoid the common pitfalls of machine-translated data and directly benefit low-resource language development.

Abstract: Amid growing efforts to leverage advances in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) for robotics, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently gained significant attention. By unifying vision, language, and action data at scale, which have traditionally been studied separately, VLA models aim to learn policies that generalise across diverse tasks, objects, embodiments, and environments. This generalisation capability is expected to enable robots to solve novel downstream tasks with minimal or no additional task-specific data, facilitating more flexible and scalable real-world deployment. Unlike previous surveys that focus narrowly on action representations or high-level model architectures, this work offers a comprehensive, full-stack review, integrating both software and hardware components of VLA systems. In particular, this paper provides a systematic review of VLAs, covering their strategy and architectural transition, architectures and building blocks, modality-specific processing techniques, and learning paradigms. In addition, to support the deployment of VLAs in real-world robotic applications, we also review commonly used robot platforms, data collection strategies, publicly available datasets, data augmentation methods, and evaluation benchmarks. Throughout this comprehensive survey, this paper aims to offer practical guidance for the robotics community in applying VLAs to real-world robotic systems. All references categorized by training approach, evaluation method, modality, and dataset are available in the table on our project website: https://vla-survey.github.io .

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have achieved impressive results in time series forecasting. However, existing Transformers still exhibit limitations in sequence modeling as they tend to overemphasize temporal dependencies. This incurs additional computational overhead without yielding corresponding performance gains. We find that the performance of Transformers is highly dependent on the embedding method used to learn effective representations. To address this issue, we extract multivariate features to augment the effective information captured in the embedding layer, yielding multidimensional embeddings that convey richer and more meaningful sequence representations. These representations enable Transformer-based forecasters to better understand the series. Specifically, we introduce Hybrid Temporal and Multivariate Embeddings (HTME). The HTME extractor integrates a lightweight temporal feature extraction module with a carefully designed multivariate feature extraction module to provide complementary features, thereby achieving a balance between model complexity and performance. By combining HTME with the Transformer architecture, we present HTMformer, leveraging the enhanced feature extraction capability of the HTME extractor to build a lightweight forecaster. Experiments conducted on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: World models are a powerful paradigm in AI and robotics, enabling agents to reason about the future by predicting visual observations or compact latent states. The 1X World Model Challenge introduces an open-source benchmark of real-world humanoid interaction, with two complementary tracks: sampling, focused on forecasting future image frames, and compression, focused on predicting future discrete latent codes. For the sampling track, we adapt the video generation foundation model Wan-2.2 TI2V-5B to video-state-conditioned future frame prediction. We condition the video generation on robot states using AdaLN-Zero, and further post-train the model using LoRA. For the compression track, we train a Spatio-Temporal Transformer model from scratch. Our models achieve 23.0 dB PSNR in the sampling task and a Top-500 CE of 6.6386 in the compression task, securing 1st place in both challenges.

Abstract: Many natural language processing (NLP) tasks involve subjectivity, ambiguity, or legitimate disagreement between annotators. In this paper, we outline our system for modeling human variation. Our system leverages language models' (LLMs) in-context learning abilities, along with a two-step meta-learning training procedure for 1) post-training on many datasets requiring in-context learning and 2) specializing the model via in-context meta-learning to the particular data distribution of interest. We also evaluate the performance of our system submission to the Learning With Disagreements (LeWiDi) competition, where it was the overall winner on both tasks. Additionally, we perform an ablation study to measure the importance of each system component. We find that including rater examples in-context is crucial for our system's performance, dataset-specific fine-tuning is helpful on the larger datasets, post-training on other in-context datasets is helpful on one of the competition datasets, and that performance improves with model scale.

<title>Graph Conditioned Diffusion for Controllable Histopathology Image Generation</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have set new standards in high-quality image synthesis. Yet, controlled generation remains challenging, particularly in sensitive areas such as medical imaging. Medical images feature inherent structure such as consistent spatial arrangement, shape or texture, all of which are critical for diagnosis. However, existing DPMs operate in noisy latent spaces that lack semantic structure and strong priors, making it difficult to ensure meaningful control over generated content. To address this, we propose graph-based object-level representations for Graph-Conditioned-Diffusion. Our approach generates graph nodes corresponding to each major structure in the image, encapsulating their individual features and relationships. These graph representations are processed by a transformer module and integrated into a diffusion model via the text-conditioning mechanism, enabling fine-grained control over generation. We evaluate this approach using a real-world histopathology use case, demonstrating that our generated data can reliably substitute for annotated patient data in downstream segmentation tasks. The code is available here.

<title>A Digital Twin Framework for Metamorphic Testing of Autonomous Driving Systems Using Generative Model</title>

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of self-driving cars remains a major challenge due to the complexity and unpredictability of real-world driving environments. Traditional testing methods face significant limitations, such as the oracle problem, which makes it difficult to determine whether a system's behavior is correct, and the inability to cover the full range of scenarios an autonomous vehicle may encounter. In this paper, we introduce a digital twin-driven metamorphic testing framework that addresses these challenges by creating a virtual replica of the self-driving system and its operating environment. By combining digital twin technology with AI-based image generative models such as Stable Diffusion, our approach enables the systematic generation of realistic and diverse driving scenes. This includes variations in weather, road topology, and environmental features, all while maintaining the core semantics of the original scenario. The digital twin provides a synchronized simulation environment where changes can be tested in a controlled and repeatable manner. Within this environment, we define three metamorphic relations inspired by real-world traffic rules and vehicle behavior. We validate our framework in the Udacity self-driving simulator and demonstrate that it significantly enhances test coverage and effectiveness. Our method achieves the highest true positive rate (0.719), F1 score (0.689), and precision (0.662) compared to baseline approaches. This paper highlights the value of integrating digital twins with AI-powered scenario generation to create a scalable, automated, and high-fidelity testing solution for autonomous vehicle safety.

<title>TrackVLA++: Unleashing Reasoning and Memory Capabilities in VLA Models for Embodied Visual Tracking</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07134</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.07134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embodied Visual Tracking (EVT) is a fundamental ability that underpins practical applications, such as companion robots, guidance robots and service assistants, where continuously following moving targets is essential. Recent advances have enabled language-guided tracking in complex and unstructured scenes. However, existing approaches lack explicit spatial reasoning and effective temporal memory, causing failures under severe occlusions or in the presence of similar-looking distractors. To address these challenges, we present TrackVLA++, a novel Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that enhances embodied visual tracking with two key modules, a spatial reasoning mechanism and a Target Identification Memory (TIM). The reasoning module introduces a Chain-of-Thought paradigm, termed Polar-CoT, which infers the target's relative position and encodes it as a compact polar-coordinate token for action prediction. Guided by these spatial priors, the TIM employs a gated update strategy to preserve long-horizon target memory, ensuring spatiotemporal consistency and mitigating target loss during extended occlusions. Extensive experiments show that TrackVLA++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks across both egocentric and multi-camera settings. On the challenging EVT-Bench DT split, TrackVLA++ surpasses the previous leading approach by 5.1 and 12, respectively. Furthermore, TrackVLA++ exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, enabling robust real-world tracking in dynamic and occluded scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) that fluently converse with humans are a reality - but do LLMs experience human-like processing difficulties? We systematically compare human and LLM sentence comprehension across seven challenging linguistic structures. We collect sentence comprehension data from humans and five families of state-of-the-art LLMs, varying in size and training procedure in a unified experimental framework. Our results show LLMs overall struggle on the target structures, but especially on garden path (GP) sentences. Indeed, while the strongest models achieve near perfect accuracy on non-GP structures (93.7% for GPT-5), they struggle on GP structures (46.8% for GPT-5). Additionally, when ranking structures based on average performance, rank correlation between humans and models increases with parameter count. For each target structure, we also collect data for their matched baseline without the difficult structure. Comparing performance on the target vs. baseline sentences, the performance gap observed in humans holds for LLMs, with two exceptions: for models that are too weak performance is uniformly low across both sentence types, and for models that are too strong the performance is uniformly high. Together, these reveal convergence and divergence in human and LLM sentence comprehension, offering new insights into the similarity of humans and LLMs.

<title>A Multi-Agent Framework for Stateful Inference-Time Search</title>

arXiv:2510.07147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work explores agentic inference-time techniques to perform structured, multi-step reasoning. However, stateless inference often struggles on multi-step tasks due to the absence of persistent state. Moreover, task-specific fine-tuning or instruction-tuning often achieve surface-level code generation but remain brittle on tasks requiring deeper reasoning and long-horizon dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose stateful multi-agent evolutionary search, a training-free framework that departs from prior stateless approaches by combining (i) persistent inference-time state, (ii) adversarial mutation, and (iii) evolutionary preservation. We demonstrate its effectiveness in automated unit test generation through the generation of edge cases. We generate robust edge cases using an evolutionary search process, where specialized agents sequentially propose, mutate, and score candidates. A controller maintains persistent state across generations, while evolutionary preservation ensures diversity and exploration across all possible cases. This yields a generalist agent capable of discovering robust, high-coverage edge cases across unseen codebases. Experiments show our stateful multi-agent inference framework achieves substantial gains in coverage over stateless single-step baselines, evaluated on prevalent unit-testing benchmarks such as HumanEval and TestGenEvalMini and using three diverse LLM families - Llama, Gemma, and GPT. These results indicate that combining persistent inference-time state with evolutionary search materially improves unit-test generation.

Abstract: Real-world robotic agents must act under partial observability and long horizons, where key cues may appear long before they affect decision making. However, most modern approaches rely solely on instantaneous information, without incorporating insights from the past. Standard recurrent or transformer models struggle with retaining and leveraging long-term dependencies: context windows truncate history, while naive memory extensions fail under scale and sparsity. We propose ELMUR (External Layer Memory with Update/Rewrite), a transformer architecture with structured external memory. Each layer maintains memory embeddings, interacts with them via bidirectional cross-attention, and updates them through an Least Recently Used (LRU) memory module using replacement or convex blending. ELMUR extends effective horizons up to 100,000 times beyond the attention window and achieves a 100% success rate on a synthetic T-Maze task with corridors up to one million steps. In POPGym, it outperforms baselines on more than half of the tasks. On MIKASA-Robo sparse-reward manipulation tasks with visual observations, it nearly doubles the performance of strong baselines. These results demonstrate that structured, layer-local external memory offers a simple and scalable approach to decision making under partial observability.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in spatial reasoning, yet they remain fundamentally limited to qualitative precision and lack the computational precision required for real-world robotics. Current approaches fail to leverage metric cues from depth sensors and camera calibration, instead reducing geometric problems to pattern recognition tasks that cannot deliver the centimeter-level accuracy essential for robotic manipulation. We present TIGeR (Tool-Integrated Geometric Reasoning), a novel framework that transforms VLMs from perceptual estimators to geometric computers by enabling them to generate and execute precise geometric computations through external tools. Rather than attempting to internalize complex geometric operations within neural networks, TIGeR empowers models to recognize geometric reasoning requirements, synthesize appropriate computational code, and invoke specialized libraries for exact calculations. To support this paradigm, we introduce TIGeR-300K, a comprehensive tool-invocation-oriented dataset covering point transformations, pose estimation, trajectory generation, and spatial compatibility verification, complete with tool invocation sequences and intermediate computations. Through a two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) with our proposed hierarchical reward design, TIGeR achieves SOTA performance on geometric reasoning benchmarks while demonstrating centimeter-level precision in real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

<title>Resolution scaling governs DINOv3 transfer performance in chest radiograph classification</title>

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has advanced visual representation learning, but its value in chest radiography, a high-volume imaging modality with fine-grained findings, remains unclear. Meta's DINOv3 extends earlier SSL models through Gram-anchored self-distillation. Whether these design choices improve transfer learning for chest radiography has not been systematically tested. We benchmarked DINOv3 against DINOv2 and ImageNet initialization across seven datasets (n>814,000). Two representative backbones were evaluated: ViT-B/16 and ConvNeXt-B. Images were analyzed at 224x224, 512x512, and 1024x1024 pixels. We additionally assessed frozen features from a 7B model. The primary outcome was mean AUROC across labels. At 224x224, DINOv3 and DINOv2 achieved comparable performance on adult datasets. Increasing resolution to 512x512 yielded consistent improvements for DINOv3 over both DINOv2 and ImageNet. In contrast, results in pediatric cohort showed no differences across initializations. Across all settings, ConvNeXt-B outperformed ViT-B/16. Models using frozen DINOv3-7B features underperformed relative to fully finetuned 86-89M-parameter backbones, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation. Scaling to 1024x1024 did not further improve accuracy. Resolution-related gains were most evident for boundary-dependent and small focal abnormalities. In chest radiography, higher input resolution is critical for leveraging the benefits of modern self-supervised models. 512x512 pixels represent a practical upper limit where DINOv3-initialized ConvNeXt-B networks provide the strongest performance, while larger inputs offer minimal return on cost. Clinically, these findings support use of finetuned, mid-sized backbones at 512x512 for chest radiograph interpretation, with the greatest gains expected in detecting subtle or boundary-centered lesions relevant to emergency and critical care settings.

<title>Language Lives in Sparse Dimensions: Toward Interpretable and Efficient Multilingual Control for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models exhibit strong multilingual capabilities despite limited exposure to non-English data. Prior studies show that English-centric large language models map multilingual content into English-aligned representations at intermediate layers and then project them back into target-language token spaces in the final layer. From this observation, we hypothesize that this cross-lingual transition is governed by a small and sparse set of dimensions, which occur at consistent indices across the intermediate to final layers. Building on this insight, we introduce a simple, training-free method to identify and manipulate these dimensions, requiring only as few as 50 sentences of either parallel or monolingual data. Experiments on a multilingual generation control task reveal the interpretability of these dimensions, demonstrating that the interventions in these dimensions can switch the output language while preserving semantic content, and that it surpasses the performance of prior neuron-based approaches at a substantially lower cost.

Abstract: Text-to-image synthesis has made remarkable progress, yet accurately interpreting complex and lengthy prompts remains challenging, often resulting in semantic inconsistencies and missing details. Existing solutions, such as fine-tuning, are model-specific and require training, while prior automatic prompt optimization (APO) approaches typically lack systematic error analysis and refinement strategies, resulting in limited reliability and effectiveness. Meanwhile, test-time scaling methods operate on fixed prompts and on noise or sample numbers, limiting their interpretability and adaptability. To solve these, we introduce a flexible and efficient test-time prompt optimization strategy that operates directly on the input text. We propose a plug-and-play multi-agent system called GenPilot, integrating error analysis, clustering-based adaptive exploration, fine-grained verification, and a memory module for iterative optimization. Our approach is model-agnostic, interpretable, and well-suited for handling long and complex prompts. Simultaneously, we summarize the common patterns of errors and the refinement strategy, offering more experience and encouraging further exploration. Experiments on DPG-bench and Geneval with improvements of up to 16.9% and 5.7% demonstrate the strong capability of our methods in enhancing the text and image consistency and structural coherence of generated images, revealing the effectiveness of our test-time prompt optimization strategy.

Abstract: Small Language models (SLMs) offer an efficient and accessible alternative to Large Language Models (LLMs), delivering strong performance while using far fewer resources. We introduce a simple and effective framework for pretraining SLMs that brings together three complementary ideas. First, we identify structurally sparse sub-network initializations that consistently outperform randomly initialized models of similar size under the same compute budget. Second, we use evolutionary search to automatically discover high-quality sub-network initializations, providing better starting points for pretraining. Third, we apply knowledge distillation from larger teacher models to speed up training and improve generalization. Together, these components make SLM pretraining substantially more efficient: our best model, discovered using evolutionary search and initialized with LLM weights, matches the validation perplexity of a comparable Pythia SLM while requiring 9.2x fewer pretraining tokens. We release all code and models at https://github.com/whittle-org/whittle/, offering a practical and reproducible path toward cost-efficient small language model development at scale.

Abstract: Causal reasoning is fundamental for Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand genuine cause-and-effect relationships beyond pattern matching. Existing benchmarks suffer from critical limitations such as reliance on synthetic data and narrow domain coverage. We introduce a novel benchmark constructed from casually identified relationships extracted from top-tier economics and finance journals, drawing on rigorous methodologies including instrumental variables, difference-in-differences, and regression discontinuity designs. Our benchmark comprises 40,379 evaluation items covering five task types across domains such as health, environment, technology, law, and culture. Experimental results on eight state-of-the-art LLMs reveal substantial limitations, with the best model achieving only 57.6\% accuracy. Moreover, model scale does not consistently translate to superior performance, and even advanced reasoning models struggle with fundamental causal relationship identification. These findings underscore a critical gap between current LLM capabilities and demands of reliable causal reasoning in high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Evaluating large language model (LLM) outputs in the legal domain presents unique challenges due to the complex and nuanced nature of legal analysis. Current evaluation approaches either depend on reference data, which is costly to produce, or use standardized assessment methods, both of which have significant limitations for legal applications.
  Although LLM-as-a-Judge has emerged as a promising evaluation technique, its reliability and effectiveness in legal contexts depend heavily on evaluation processes unique to the legal industry and how trustworthy the evaluation appears to the human legal expert. This is where existing evaluation methods currently fail and exhibit considerable variability.
  This paper aims to close the gap: a) we break down lengthy responses into 'Legal Data Points' (LDPs), self-contained units of information, and introduce a novel, reference-free evaluation methodology that reflects how lawyers evaluate legal answers; b) we demonstrate that our method outperforms a variety of baselines on both our proprietary dataset and an open-source dataset (LegalBench); c) we show how our method correlates more closely with human expert evaluations and helps improve inter-annotator agreement; and finally d) we open source our Legal Data Points for a subset of LegalBench used in our experiments, allowing the research community to replicate our results and advance research in this vital area of LLM evaluation on legal question-answering.

Abstract: This short essay is a reworking of the answers offered by the author at the Debate Session of the AIHUB (CSIC) and EduCaixa Summer School, organized by Marta Garcia-Matos and Lissette Lemus, and coordinated by Albert Sabater (OEIAC, UG), with the participation of Vanina Martinez-Posse (IIIA-CSIC), Eulalia Soler (Eurecat) and Pompeu Casanovas (IIIA-CSIC) on July 4th 2025. Albert Sabater posed three questions: (1) How can regulatory frameworks priori-tise the protection of fundamental rights (privacy, non-discrimination, autonomy, etc.) in the development of AI, without falling into the false dichotomy between regulation and innova-tion? (2) Given the risks of AI (bias, mass surveillance, manipulation), what examples of regu-lations or policies have demonstrated that it is possible to foster responsible innovation, putting the public interest before profitability, without giving in to competitive pressure from actors such as China or the US? (3) In a scenario where the US prioritizes flexibility, what mecha-nisms could ensure that international cooperation in AI does not become a race to the bottom in rights, but rather a global standard of accountability? The article attempts to answer these three questions and concludes with some reflections on the relevance of the answers for education and research.

Abstract: Rubrics provide a flexible way to train LLMs on open-ended long-form answers where verifiable rewards are not applicable and human preferences provide coarse signals. Prior work shows that reinforcement learning with rubric-based rewards leads to consistent gains in LLM post-training. Most existing approaches rely on rubrics that remain static over the course of training. Such static rubrics, however, are vulnerable to reward-hacking type behaviors and fail to capture emergent desiderata that arise during training. We introduce Online Rubrics Elicitation (OnlineRubrics), a method that dynamically curates evaluation criteria in an online manner through pairwise comparisons of responses from current and reference policies. This online process enables continuous identification and mitigation of errors as training proceeds. Empirically, this approach yields consistent improvements of up to 8% over training exclusively with static rubrics across AlpacaEval, GPQA, ArenaHard as well as the validation sets of expert questions and rubrics. We qualitatively analyze the elicited criteria and identify prominent themes such as transparency, practicality, organization, and reasoning.

Abstract: The escalating complexity of network threats and the inherent class imbalance in traffic data present formidable challenges for modern Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in modeling topological structures and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) are proficient in capturing time-series dependencies, a framework that synergistically integrates both while explicitly addressing data imbalance remains an open challenge. This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework, named Gated Temporal Convolutional Network and Graph (GTCN-G), engineered to overcome these limitations. Our model uniquely fuses a Gated TCN (G-TCN) for extracting hierarchical temporal features from network flows with a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) designed to learn from the underlying graph structure. The core innovation lies in the integration of a residual learning mechanism, implemented via a Graph Attention Network (GAT). This mechanism preserves original feature information through residual connections, which is critical for mitigating the class imbalance problem and enhancing detection sensitivity for rare malicious activities (minority classes). We conducted extensive experiments on two public benchmark datasets, UNSW-NB15 and ToN-IoT, to validate our approach. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed GTCN-G model achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baseline models in both binary and multi-class classification tasks.

Abstract: Predicting the fitness impact of mutations is central to protein engineering but constrained by limited assays relative to the size of sequence space. Protein language models (pLMs) trained with masked language modeling (MLM) exhibit strong zero-shot fitness prediction; we provide a unifying view by interpreting natural evolution as implicit reward maximization and MLM as inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), in which extant sequences act as expert demonstrations and pLM log-odds serve as fitness estimates. Building on this perspective, we introduce EvoIF, a lightweight model that integrates two complementary sources of evolutionary signal: (i) within-family profiles from retrieved homologs and (ii) cross-family structural-evolutionary constraints distilled from inverse folding logits. EvoIF fuses sequence-structure representations with these profiles via a compact transition block, yielding calibrated probabilities for log-odds scoring. On ProteinGym (217 mutational assays; >2.5M mutants), EvoIF and its MSA-enabled variant achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance while using only 0.15% of the training data and fewer parameters than recent large models. Ablations confirm that within-family and cross-family profiles are complementary, improving robustness across function types, MSA depths, taxa, and mutation depths. The codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/aim-uofa/EvoIF.

<title>AudioMarathon: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Long-Context Audio Understanding and Efficiency in Audio LLMs</title>

Abstract: Processing long-form audio is a major challenge for Large Audio Language models (LALMs). These models struggle with the quadratic cost of attention ($O(N^2)$) and with modeling long-range temporal dependencies. Existing audio benchmarks are built mostly from short clips and do not evaluate models in realistic long context settings. To address this gap, we introduce AudioMarathon, a benchmark designed to evaluate both understanding and inference efficiency on long-form audio. AudioMarathon provides a diverse set of tasks built upon three pillars: long-context audio inputs with durations ranging from 90.0 to 300.0 seconds, which correspond to encoded sequences of 2,250 to 7,500 audio tokens, respectively, full domain coverage across speech, sound, and music, and complex reasoning that requires multi-hop inference. We evaluate state-of-the-art LALMs and observe clear performance drops as audio length grows. We also study acceleration techniques and analyze the trade-offs of token pruning and KV cache eviction. The results show large gaps across current LALMs and highlight the need for better temporal reasoning and memory-efficient architectures. We believe AudioMarathon will drive the audio and multimodal research community to develop more advanced audio understanding models capable of solving complex audio tasks.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models memorize and leak training data, causing serious privacy issues to data owners. Training algorithms with differential privacy (DP), such as DP-SGD, have been gaining attention as a solution. However, DP-SGD adds a noise at each training iteration, which degrades the accuracy of the trained model. To improve accuracy, a new family of approaches adds carefully designed correlated noises, so that noises cancel out each other across iterations. We performed an extensive characterization study of these new mechanisms, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, and show they incur non-negligible overheads when the model is large or uses large embedding tables. Motivated by the analysis, we propose Cocoon, a hardware-software co-designed framework for efficient training with correlated noises. Cocoon accelerates models with embedding tables through pre-computing and storing correlated noises in a coalesced format (Cocoon-Emb), and supports large models through a custom near-memory processing device (Cocoon-NMP). On a real system with an FPGA-based NMP device prototype, Cocoon improves the performance by 2.33-10.82x(Cocoon-Emb) and 1.55-3.06x (Cocoon-NMP).

Abstract: While Language Models (LMs) have made significant progress in automating machine learning engineering (MLE), the acquisition of high-quality MLE training data is significantly constrained. Current MLE benchmarks suffer from low scalability and limited applicability because they rely on static, manually curated tasks, demanding extensive time and manual effort to produce. We introduce MLE-Smith, a fully automated multi-agent pipeline, to transform raw datasets into competition-style MLE challenges through an efficient generate-verify-execute paradigm for scaling MLE tasks with verifiable quality, real-world usability, and rich diversity. The proposed multi-agent pipeline in MLE-Smith drives structured task design and standardized refactoring, coupled with a hybrid verification mechanism that enforces strict structural rules and high-level semantic soundness. It further validates empirical solvability and real-world fidelity through interactive execution. We apply MLE-Smith to 224 of real-world datasets and generate 606 tasks spanning multiple categories, objectives, and modalities, demonstrating that MLE-Smith can work effectively across a wide range of real-world datasets. Evaluation on the generated tasks shows that the performance of eight mainstream and cutting-edge LLMs on MLE-Smith tasks is strongly correlated with their performance on carefully human-designed tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of the MLE-Smith to scaling up MLE tasks, while maintaining task quality.

Abstract: Large language models excel at short-horizon reasoning tasks, but performance drops as reasoning horizon lengths increase. Existing approaches to combat this rely on inference-time scaffolding or costly step-level supervision, neither of which scales easily. In this work, we introduce a scalable method to bootstrap long-horizon reasoning capabilities using only existing, abundant short-horizon data. Our approach synthetically composes simple problems into complex, multi-step dependency chains of arbitrary length. We train models on this data using outcome-only rewards under a curriculum that automatically increases in complexity, allowing RL training to be scaled much further without saturating. Empirically, our method generalizes remarkably well: curriculum training on composed 6th-grade level math problems (GSM8K) boosts accuracy on longer, competition-level benchmarks (GSM-Symbolic, MATH-500, AIME) by up to 2.06x. Importantly, our long-horizon improvements are significantly higher than baselines even at high pass@k, showing that models can learn new reasoning paths under RL. Theoretically, we show that curriculum RL with outcome rewards achieves an exponential improvement in sample complexity over full-horizon training, providing training signal comparable to dense supervision. h1 therefore introduces an efficient path towards scaling RL for long-horizon problems using only existing data.

Abstract: Nuclear fusion plays a pivotal role in the quest for reliable and sustainable energy production. A major roadblock to viable fusion power is understanding plasma turbulence, which significantly impairs plasma confinement, and is vital for next-generation reactor design. Plasma turbulence is governed by the nonlinear gyrokinetic equation, which evolves a 5D distribution function over time. Due to its high computational cost, reduced-order models are often employed in practice to approximate turbulent transport of energy. However, they omit nonlinear effects unique to the full 5D dynamics. To tackle this, we introduce GyroSwin, the first scalable 5D neural surrogate that can model 5D nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations, thereby capturing the physical phenomena neglected by reduced models, while providing accurate estimates of turbulent heat transport.GyroSwin (i) extends hierarchical Vision Transformers to 5D, (ii) introduces cross-attention and integration modules for latent 3D$\leftrightarrow$5D interactions between electrostatic potential fields and the distribution function, and (iii) performs channelwise mode separation inspired by nonlinear physics. We demonstrate that GyroSwin outperforms widely used reduced numerics on heat flux prediction, captures the turbulent energy cascade, and reduces the cost of fully resolved nonlinear gyrokinetics by three orders of magnitude while remaining physically verifiable. GyroSwin shows promising scaling laws, tested up to one billion parameters, paving the way for scalable neural surrogates for gyrokinetic simulations of plasma turbulence.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have catalyzed vibe coding, where users leverage LLMs to generate and iteratively refine code through natural language interactions until it passes their vibe check. Vibe check is tied to real-world human preference and goes beyond functionality: the solution should feel right, read cleanly, preserve intent, and remain correct. However, current code evaluation remains anchored to pass@k and captures only functional correctness, overlooking the non-functional instructions that users routinely apply. In this paper, we hypothesize that instruction following is the missing piece underlying vibe check that represents human preference in coding besides functional correctness. To quantify models' code instruction following capabilities with measurable signals, we present VeriCode, a taxonomy of 30 verifiable code instructions together with corresponding deterministic verifiers. We use the taxonomy to augment established evaluation suites, resulting in Vibe Checker, a testbed to assess both code instruction following and functional correctness. Upon evaluating 31 leading LLMs, we show that even the strongest models struggle to comply with multiple instructions and exhibit clear functional regression. Most importantly, a composite score of functional correctness and instruction following correlates the best with human preference, with the latter emerging as the primary differentiator on real-world programming tasks. Our work identifies core factors of the vibe check, providing a concrete path for benchmarking and developing models that better align with user preferences in coding.

Abstract: Long-sequence modeling faces a fundamental trade-off between the efficiency of compressive fixed-size memory in RNN-like models and the fidelity of lossless growing memory in attention-based Transformers. Inspired by the Multi-Store Model in cognitive science, we introduce a memory framework of artificial neural networks. Our method maintains a sliding window of the Transformer's KV cache as lossless short-term memory, while a learnable module termed Artificial Hippocampus Network (AHN) recurrently compresses out-of-window information into a fixed-size compact long-term memory. To validate this framework, we instantiate AHNs using modern RNN-like architectures, including Mamba2, DeltaNet, and Gated DeltaNet. Extensive experiments on long-context benchmarks LV-Eval and InfiniteBench demonstrate that AHN-augmented models consistently outperform sliding window baselines and achieve performance comparable or even superior to full-attention models, while substantially reducing computational and memory requirements. For instance, augmenting the Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct with AHNs reduces inference FLOPs by 40.5% and memory cache by 74.0%, while improving its average score on LV-Eval (128k sequence length) from 4.41 to 5.88. Code is available at: https://github.com/ByteDance-Seed/AHN.

Abstract: As machine learning models become more general, we need to characterise them in richer, more meaningful ways. We describe a method to infer the cognitive profile of a system from diverse experimental data. To do so, we introduce measurement layouts that model how task-instance features interact with system capabilities to affect performance. These features must be triangulated in complex ways to be able to infer capabilities from non-populational data -- a challenge for traditional psychometric and inferential tools. Using the Bayesian probabilistic programming library PyMC, we infer different cognitive profiles for agents in two scenarios: 68 actual contestants in the AnimalAI Olympics and 30 synthetic agents for O-PIAAGETS, an object permanence battery. We showcase the potential for capability-oriented evaluation.

Abstract: Procedural mistake detection (PMD) is a challenging problem of classifying whether a human user (observed through egocentric video) has successfully executed a task (specified by a procedural text). Despite significant recent efforts, machine performance in the wild remains nonviable, and the reasoning processes underlying this performance are opaque. As such, we extend PMD to require generating visual self-dialog rationales to inform decisions. Given the impressive, mature image understanding capabilities observed in recent vision-and-language models (VLMs), we curate a suitable benchmark dataset for PMD based on individual frames. As our reformulation enables unprecedented transparency, we leverage a natural language inference (NLI) model to formulate two automated metrics for the coherence of generated rationales. We establish baselines for this reframed task, showing that VLMs struggle off-the-shelf, but with some trade-offs, their accuracy, coherence, and efficiency can be improved by incorporating these metrics into common inference and fine-tuning methods. Lastly, our multi-faceted metrics visualize common outcomes, highlighting areas for further improvement.

Abstract: As digitalization and cloud technologies evolve, the web is becoming increasingly important in the modern society. Autonomous web agents based on large language models (LLMs) hold a great potential in work automation. It is therefore important to accurately measure and monitor the progression of their capabilities. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive and rigorous assessment of the current state of web agents. Our results depict a very different picture of the competency of current agents, suggesting over-optimism in previously reported results. This gap can be attributed to shortcomings in existing benchmarks. We introduce Online-Mind2Web, an online evaluation benchmark consisting of 300 diverse and realistic tasks spanning 136 websites. It enables us to evaluate web agents under a setting that approximates how real users use these agents. To facilitate more scalable evaluation and development, we also develop a novel LLM-as-a-Judge automatic evaluation method and show that it can achieve around 85% agreement with human judgment, substantially higher than existing methods. Finally, we present the first comprehensive comparative analysis of current web agents, highlighting both their strengths and limitations to inspire future research.

<title>Empirically evaluating commonsense intelligence in large language models with large-scale human judgments</title>

Abstract: Commonsense intelligence in machines is often assessed by static benchmarks that compare a model's output against human-prescribed correct labels. An important, albeit implicit, assumption of these labels is that they accurately capture what any human would think, effectively treating human common sense as homogeneous. However, recent empirical work has shown that humans vary enormously in what they consider commonsensical; thus what appears self-evident to one benchmark designer may not be so to another. Here, we propose a method for evaluating common sense in artificial intelligence (AI), specifically in large language models (LLMs), that incorporates empirically observed heterogeneity among humans by measuring the correspondence between a model's judgment and that of a human population. We first find that, when treated as independent survey respondents, most LLMs remain below the human median in their individual commonsense competence. Second, when used as simulators of a hypothetical population, LLMs correlate with real humans only modestly in the extent to which they agree on the same set of statements. In both cases, smaller, open-weight models are surprisingly more competitive than larger, proprietary frontier models. Our evaluation framework, which ties commonsense intelligence to its cultural basis, contributes to the growing call for adapting AI models to human collectivities that possess different, often incompatible, social stocks of knowledge.

Abstract: This work presents a dual-agent \ac{llm}-based reasoning framework for automated planar mechanism synthesis that tightly couples linguistic specification with symbolic representation and simulation. From a natural-language task description, the system composes symbolic constraints and equations, generates and parametrises simulation code, and iteratively refines designs via critic-driven feedback, including symbolic regression and geometric distance metrics, closing an actionable linguistic/symbolic optimisation loop. To evaluate the approach, we introduce MSynth, a benchmark of analytically defined planar trajectories. Empirically, critic feedback and iterative refinement yield large improvements (up to 90\% on individual tasks) and statistically significant gains per the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Symbolic-regression prompts provide deeper mechanistic insight primarily when paired with larger models or architectures with appropriate inductive biases (e.g., LRM).

Abstract: Subgraph matching in logic circuits is foundational for numerous Electronic Design Automation (EDA) applications, including datapath optimization, arithmetic verification, and hardware trojan detection. However, existing techniques rely primarily on structural graph isomorphism and thus fail to identify function-related subgraphs when synthesis transformations substantially alter circuit topology. To overcome this critical limitation, we introduce the concept of functional subgraph matching, a novel approach that identifies whether a given logic function is implicitly present within a larger circuit, irrespective of structural variations induced by synthesis or technology mapping. Specifically, we propose a two-stage multi-modal framework: (1) learning robust functional embeddings across AIG and post-mapping netlists for functional subgraph detection, and (2) identifying fuzzy boundaries using a graph segmentation approach. Evaluations on standard benchmarks (ITC99, OpenABCD, ForgeEDA) demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing structural methods, with average $93.8\%$ accuracy in functional subgraph detection and a dice score of $91.3\%$ in fuzzy boundary identification.

However, it is unclear what behavior is effective and what behavior is missing for long-horizon AI agents tasks. In this work, we propose Dyna-Think, a thinking framework that integrates planning with an internal world model with reasoning and acting to enhance AI agent performance. To enable Dyna-Think, we propose Dyna-Think Imitation Learning (DIT) and Dyna-Think Dyna Training (DDT). To initialize a policy with Dyna-Think, DIT reconstructs the thinking process of R1 to focus on performing world model simulation relevant to the proposed (and planned) action, and trains the policy using this reconstructed data. To enhance Dyna-Think, DDT uses a two-stage training process to first improve the agent's world modeling ability via objectives such as state prediction or critique generation, and then improve the agent's action via policy training. We evaluate our methods on OSWorld and WindowsAgentArena, and demonstrate that Dyna-Think improves the agent's in-domain and out-of-domain performance, achieving similar best-of-n performance compared to R1 while generating 2x less tokens on average. Our extensive empirical studies reveal that 1) using critique generation for world model training is effective to improve policy performance; and 2) AI agents with better performance correlate with better world modeling abilities. We believe our results suggest a promising research direction to integrate world model simulation into AI agents to enhance their reasoning, planning, and acting capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly slow-thinking models, often exhibit severe hallucination, outputting incorrect content due to an inability to accurately recognize knowledge boundaries during reasoning. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) can enhance complex reasoning abilities, its outcome-oriented reward mechanism often lacks factual supervision over the thinking process, further exacerbating the hallucination problem. To address the high hallucination in slow-thinking models, we propose Knowledge-enhanced RL, KnowRL. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. This targeted factual input during RL training enables the model to learn and internalize fact-based reasoning strategies. By directly rewarding adherence to facts within the reasoning steps, KnowRL fosters a more reliable thinking process. Experimental results on three hallucination evaluation datasets and two reasoning evaluation datasets demonstrate that KnowRL effectively mitigates hallucinations in slow-thinking models while maintaining their original strong reasoning capabilities. Our code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowRL.

Abstract: In medical coding, experts map unstructured clinical notes to alphanumeric codes for diagnoses and procedures. We introduce Code Like Humans: a new agentic framework for medical coding with large language models. It implements official coding guidelines for human experts, and it is the first solution that can support the full ICD-10 coding system (+70K labels). It achieves the best performance to date on rare diagnosis codes (fine-tuned discriminative classifiers retain an advantage for high-frequency codes, to which they are limited). Towards future work, we also contribute an analysis of system performance and identify its `blind spots' (codes that are systematically undercoded).

<title>Toward Causal-Visual Programming: Enhancing Agentic Reasoning in Low-Code Environments</title>

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of orchestrating complex tasks in low-code environments. However, these agents often exhibit hallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning mechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal understanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual Programming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly introducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to define a simple "world model" for workflow modules through an intuitive low-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that explicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph acts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring its decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing logical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious correlations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic experiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift between the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally anchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a purely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations experienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this study are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the proposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to a user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors caused by causal confusion in dynamic environments. CVP offers a viable path toward building more interpretable, reliable, and trustworthy AI agents.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a wide range of industries, primarily due to their impressive generative abilities. Yet, their potential in applications requiring cognitive abilities, such as psychological counseling, remains largely untapped. This paper investigates the key question: Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological counseling? To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a psychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the qualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S. National Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human counselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate sufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a role. To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in U.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional counselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass. PsychoBench comprises approximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to require deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of psychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's ability to function as a counselor. Our evaluation shows that advanced models such as GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieve well above the passing threshold, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B) remain far below it. These results suggest that only frontier LLMs are currently capable of meeting counseling exam standards, highlighting both the promise and the challenges of developing psychology-oriented LLMs.

<title>Attacking the Spike: On the Transferability and Security of Spiking Neural Networks to Adversarial Examples</title>

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have drawn much attention for their high energy efficiency and recent advances in classification performance. However, unlike traditional deep learning, the robustness of SNNs to adversarial examples remains underexplored. This work advances the adversarial attack side of SNNs and makes three major contributions. First, we show that successful white-box attacks on SNNs strongly depend on the surrogate gradient estimation technique, even for adversarially trained models. Second, using the best single surrogate gradient estimator, we study the transferability of adversarial examples between SNNs and state-of-the-art architectures such as Vision Transformers (ViTs) and CNNs. Our analysis reveals two major gaps: no existing white-box attack leverages multiple surrogate estimators, and no single attack effectively fools both SNNs and non-SNN models simultaneously. Third, we propose the Mixed Dynamic Spiking Estimation (MDSE) attack, which dynamically combines multiple surrogate gradients to overcome these gaps. MDSE produces adversarial examples that fool both SNN and non-SNN models, achieving up to 91.4% higher effectiveness on SNN/ViT ensembles and a 3x boost on adversarially trained SNN ensembles over Auto-PGD. Experiments span three datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet) and nineteen classifiers, and we will release code and models upon publication.

Abstract: Advertisement video editing aims to automatically edit advertising videos into shorter videos while retaining coherent content and crucial information conveyed by advertisers. It mainly contains two stages: video segmentation and segment assemblage. The existing method performs well at video segmentation stages but suffers from the problems of dependencies on extra cumbersome models and poor performance at the segment assemblage stage. To address these problems, we propose M-SAN (Multi-modal Segment Assemblage Network) which can perform efficient and coherent segment assemblage task end-to-end. It utilizes multi-modal representation extracted from the segments and follows the Encoder-Decoder Ptr-Net framework with the Attention mechanism. Importance-coherence reward is designed for training M-SAN. We experiment on the Ads-1k dataset with 1000+ videos under rich ad scenarios collected from advertisers. To evaluate the methods, we propose a unified metric, Imp-Coh@Time, which comprehensively assesses the importance, coherence, and duration of the outputs at the same time. Experimental results show that our method achieves better performance than random selection and the previous method on the metric. Ablation experiments further verify that multi-modal representation and importance-coherence reward significantly improve the performance. Ads-1k dataset is available at: https://github.com/yunlong10/Ads-1k

Abstract: This article introduces the Membership Inference Test (MINT), a novel approach that aims to empirically assess if given data was used during the training of AI/ML models. Specifically, we propose two MINT architectures designed to learn the distinct activation patterns that emerge when an Audited Model is exposed to data used during its training process. These architectures are based on Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The experimental framework focuses on the challenging task of Face Recognition, considering three state-of-the-art Face Recognition systems. Experiments are carried out using six publicly available databases, comprising over 22 million face images in total. Different experimental scenarios are considered depending on the context of the AI model to test. Our proposed MINT approach achieves promising results, with up to 90\% accuracy, indicating the potential to recognize if an AI model has been trained with specific data. The proposed MINT approach can serve to enforce privacy and fairness in several AI applications, e.g., revealing if sensitive or private data was used for training or tuning Large Language Models (LLMs).

<title>Unlocking Dataset Distillation with Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Dataset distillation seeks to condense datasets into smaller but highly representative synthetic samples. While diffusion models now lead all generative benchmarks, current distillation methods avoid them and rely instead on GANs or autoencoders, or, at best, sampling from a fixed diffusion prior. This trend arises because naive backpropagation through the long denoising chain leads to vanishing gradients, which prevents effective synthetic sample optimization. To address this limitation, we introduce Latent Dataset Distillation with Diffusion Models (LD3M), the first method to learn gradient-based distilled latents and class embeddings end-to-end through a pre-trained latent diffusion model. A linearly decaying skip connection, injected from the initial noisy state into every reverse step, preserves the gradient signal across dozens of timesteps without requiring diffusion weight fine-tuning. Across multiple ImageNet subsets at 128x128 and 256x256, LD3M improves downstream accuracy by up to 4.8 percentage points (1 IPC) and 4.2 points (10 IPC) over the prior state-of-the-art. The code for LD3M is provided at https://github.com/Brian-Moser/prune_and_distill.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in language generation and general task performance. However, their application to spoken language understanding (SLU) remains challenging, particularly for token-level tasks, where the autoregressive nature of LLMs often leads to misalignment issues. They also struggle to capture nuanced interrelations in semantic-level tasks through direct fine-tuning alone. To address these challenges, we propose the Entity-level Language Model (ECLM) framework, which reformulates slot-filling as an entity recognition task and introduces a novel concept, \textit{Chain of Intent}, to enable step-by-step multi-intent recognition. Experimental results show that ECLM significantly outperforms strong baselines such as Uni-MIS, achieving gains of 3.7\% on MixATIS and 3.1\% on MixSNIPS. Compared to standard supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, ECLM further achieves improvements of 8.5\% and 21.2\% on these datasets, respectively. Our code is available at https://github.com/SJY8460/ECLM.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language and multimodal domains. By fine-tuning multimodal LLMs with temporal annotations from well-annotated datasets, e.g., dense video captioning datasets, their temporal understanding capacity in video-language tasks can be obtained. However, there is a notable lack of untrimmed audio-visual video datasets with precise temporal annotations for events. This deficiency hinders LLMs from learning the alignment between time, audio-visual events, and text tokens, thus impairing their ability to temporally localize audio-visual events in videos. To address this gap, we introduce PU-VALOR, a comprehensive audio-visual dataset comprising over 114,000 pseudo-untrimmed videos with detailed temporal annotations. PU-VALOR is derived from the large-scale but coarse-annotated audio-visual dataset VALOR, through a subtle method involving event-based video clustering, random temporal scaling, and permutation. By fine-tuning a multimodal LLM on PU-VALOR, we developed AVicuna, a model capable of aligning audio-visual events with temporal intervals and corresponding text tokens. AVicuna excels in temporal localization and time-aware dialogue capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that AVicuna effectively handles temporal understanding in audio-visual videos and achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-ended video QA, audio-visual QA, and audio-visual event dense localization tasks.

Abstract: Video summarization aims to create short, accurate, and cohesive summaries of longer videos. Despite the existence of various video summarization datasets, a notable limitation is their limited amount of source videos, which hampers the effective training of advanced large vision-language models (VLMs). Additionally, most existing datasets are created for video-to-video summarization, overlooking the contemporary need for multimodal video content summarization. Recent efforts have been made to expand from unimodal to multimodal video summarization, categorizing the task into three sub-tasks based on the summary's modality: video-to-video (V2V), video-to-text (V2T), and a combination of video and text summarization (V2VT). However, the textual summaries in previous multimodal datasets are inadequate. To address these issues, we introduce Instruct-V2Xum, a cross-modal video summarization dataset featuring 30,000 diverse videos sourced from YouTube, with lengths ranging from 40 to 940 seconds and an average summarization ratio of 16.39%. Each video summary in Instruct-V2Xum is paired with a textual summary that references specific frame indexes, facilitating the generation of aligned video and textual summaries. In addition, we propose a new video summarization framework named V2Xum-LLM. V2Xum-LLM, specifically V2Xum-LLaMA in this study, is the first framework that unifies different video summarization tasks into one large language model's (LLM) text decoder and achieves task-controllable video summarization with temporal prompts and task instructions. Experiments show that V2Xum-LLaMA outperforms strong baseline models on multiple video summarization tasks. Furthermore, we propose an enhanced evaluation metric for V2V and V2VT summarization tasks.

arXiv:2406.15222v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate and timely diagnosis of acute aortic syndromes (AAS) in patients presenting with acute chest pain remains a clinical challenge. Aortic CT angiography (CTA) is the imaging protocol of choice in patients with suspected AAS. However, due to economic and workflow constraints in China, the majority of suspected patients initially undergo non-contrast CT as the initial imaging testing, and CTA is reserved for those at higher risk. In this work, we present an artificial intelligence-based warning system, iAorta, using non-contrast CT for AAS identification in China, which demonstrates remarkably high accuracy and provides clinicians with interpretable warnings. iAorta was evaluated through a comprehensive step-wise study. In the multi-center retrospective study (n = 20,750), iAorta achieved a mean area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.958 (95% CI 0.950-0.967). In the large-scale real-world study (n = 137,525), iAorta demonstrated consistently high performance across various non-contrast CT protocols, achieving a sensitivity of 0.913-0.942 and a specificity of 0.991-0.993. In the prospective comparative study (n = 13,846), iAorta demonstrated the capability to significantly shorten the time to correct diagnostic pathway. For the prospective pilot deployment that we conducted, iAorta correctly identified 21 out of 22 patients with AAS among 15,584 consecutive patients presenting with acute chest pain and under non-contrast CT protocol in the emergency department (ED) and enabled the average diagnostic time of these 21 AAS positive patients to be 102.1 (75-133) mins. Last, the iAorta can help avoid delayed or missed diagnosis of AAS in settings where non-contrast CT remains the unavoidable the initial or only imaging test in resource-constrained regions and in patients who cannot or did not receive intravenous contrast.

Abstract: It is common to reject undesired outputs of Large Language Models (LLMs); however, current methods to do so require an excessive amount of computation to re-sample after a rejection, or distort the distribution of outputs by constraining the output to highly improbable tokens. We present a method, Approximately Aligned Decoding (AprAD), to balance the distortion of the output distribution with computational efficiency, inspired by algorithms from the speculative decoding literature. AprAD allows for the generation of long sequences of text with difficult-to-satisfy constraints, while amplifying low probability outputs much less compared to existing methods. We show through a series of experiments that the task-specific performance of AprAD is comparable to methods that do not distort the output distribution, while being much more computationally efficient.

Abstract: This study explores the intersection of neural networks and classical robotics algorithms through the Neural Algorithmic Reasoning (NAR) blueprint, enabling the training of neural networks to reason like classical robotics algorithms by learning to execute them. Algorithms are integral to robotics and safety-critical applications due to their predictable and consistent performance through logical and mathematical principles. In contrast, while neural networks are highly adaptable, handling complex, high-dimensional data and generalising across tasks, they often lack interpretability and transparency in their internal computations. To bridge the two, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based framework, NAR-*ICP, that learns the intermediate computations of classical ICP-based registration algorithms, extending the CLRS Benchmark. We evaluate our approach across real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating its flexibility in handling complex inputs, and its potential to be used within larger learning pipelines. Our method achieves superior performance compared to the baselines, even surpassing the algorithms it was trained on, further demonstrating its ability to generalise beyond the capabilities of traditional algorithms.

Abstract: Stochastic differential equations are commonly used to describe the evolution of stochastic processes. The state uncertainty of such processes is best represented by the probability density function (PDF), whose evolution is governed by the Fokker-Planck partial differential equation (FP-PDE). However, it is generally infeasible to solve the FP-PDE in closed form. In this work, we show that physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) can be trained to approximate the solution PDF. Our main contribution is the analysis of PINN approximation error: we develop a theoretical framework to construct tight error bounds using PINNs. In addition, we derive a practical error bound that can be efficiently constructed with standard training methods. We discuss that this error-bound framework generalizes to approximate solutions of other linear PDEs. Empirical results on nonlinear, high-dimensional, and chaotic systems validate the correctness of our error bounds while demonstrating the scalability of PINNs and their significant computational speedup in obtaining accurate PDF solutions compared to the Monte Carlo approach.

arXiv:2411.04975v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speculative decoding is widely adopted to reduce latency in large language model (LLM) inference by leveraging smaller draft models capable of handling diverse user tasks. However, emerging AI applications, such as LLM-based agents, present unique workload characteristics: instead of diverse independent requests, agentic frameworks typically submit repetitive inference requests, such as multi-agent pipelines performing similar subtasks or self-refinement loops iteratively enhancing outputs. These workloads result in long and highly predictable sequences, which current speculative decoding methods do not effectively exploit. To address this gap, we introduce \emph{SuffixDecoding}, a novel method that utilizes efficient suffix trees to cache long token sequences from prompts and previous outputs. By adaptively speculating more tokens when acceptance likelihood is high and fewer when it is low, SuffixDecoding effectively exploits opportunities for longer speculations while conserving computation when those opportunities are limited. Evaluations on agentic benchmarks, including SWE-Bench and Text-to-SQL, demonstrate that SuffixDecoding achieves speedups of up to 5.3$\times$, outperforming state-of-the-art methods -- 2.8$\times$ faster than model-based approaches like EAGLE-2/3 and 1.9$\times$ faster than model-free approaches such as Token Recycling. SuffixDecoding is open-sourced at https://github.com/snowflakedb/ArcticInference

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has enabled significant progress in multimodal understanding, expanding their capacity to analyze video content. However, existing evaluation benchmarks for MLLMs primarily focus on abstract video comprehension, lacking a detailed assessment of their ability to understand video compositions, the nuanced interpretation of how visual elements combine and interact within highly compiled video contexts. We introduce VidComposition, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the video composition understanding capabilities of MLLMs using carefully curated compiled videos and cinematic-level annotations. VidComposition includes 982 videos with 1706 multiple-choice questions, covering various compositional aspects such as camera movement, angle, shot size, narrative structure, character actions and emotions, etc. Our comprehensive evaluation of 33 open-source and proprietary MLLMs reveals a significant performance gap between human and model capabilities. This highlights the limitations of current MLLMs in understanding complex, compiled video compositions and offers insights into areas for further improvement. The leaderboard and evaluation code are available at https://yunlong10.github.io/VidComposition/.

Abstract: Quantifying forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is crucial for informing decisions and policies that will protect the planet. Machine learning (ML) and remote sensing (RS) techniques have been used to do this task more effectively, yet there lacks a systematic review on the most recent working combinations of ML methods and multiple RS sources, especially with the consideration of the forests' ecological characteristics. This study systematically analyzed 25 papers that met strict inclusion criteria from over 80 related studies, identifying all ML methods and combinations of RS data used. Random Forest had the most frequent appearance (88\% of studies), while Extreme Gradient Boosting showed superior performance in 75\% of the studies in which it was compared with other methods. Sentinel-1 emerged as the most utilized remote sensing source, with multi-sensor approaches (e.g., Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and LiDAR) proving especially effective. Our findings provide grounds for recommending which sensing sources, variables, and methods to consider using when integrating ML and RS for forest AGB estimation.

Abstract: With the wide application of deep neural network models in various computer vision tasks, there has been a proliferation of adversarial example generation strategies aimed at deeply exploring model security. However, existing adversarial training defense models, which rely on single or limited types of attacks under a one-time learning process, struggle to adapt to the dynamic and evolving nature of attack methods. Therefore, to achieve defense performance improvements for models in long-term applications, we propose a novel Sustainable Self-Evolution Adversarial Training (SSEAT) framework. Specifically, we introduce a continual adversarial defense pipeline to realize learning from various kinds of adversarial examples across multiple stages. Additionally, to address the issue of model catastrophic forgetting caused by continual learning from ongoing novel attacks, we propose an adversarial data replay module to better select more diverse and key relearning data. Furthermore, we design a consistency regularization strategy to encourage current defense models to learn more from previously trained ones, guiding them to retain more past knowledge and maintain accuracy on clean samples. Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify the efficacy of the proposed SSEAT defense method, which demonstrates superior defense performance and classification accuracy compared to competitors.Code is available at https://github.com/aup520/SSEAT

<title>Evil twins are not that evil: Qualitative insights into machine-generated prompts</title>

Abstract: It has been widely observed that language models (LMs) respond in predictable ways to algorithmically generated prompts that are seemingly unintelligible. This is both a sign that we lack a full understanding of how LMs work, and a practical challenge, because opaqueness can be exploited for harmful uses of LMs, such as jailbreaking. We present the first thorough analysis of opaque machine-generated prompts, or autoprompts, pertaining to 6 LMs of different sizes and families. We find that machine-generated prompts are characterized by a last token that is often intelligible and strongly affects the generation. A small but consistent proportion of the previous tokens are prunable, probably appearing in the prompt as a by-product of the fact that the optimization process fixes the number of tokens. The remaining tokens fall into two categories: filler tokens, which can be replaced with semantically unrelated substitutes, and keywords, that tend to have at least a loose semantic relation with the generation, although they do not engage in well-formed syntactic relations with it. Additionally, human experts can reliably identify the most influential tokens in an autoprompt a posteriori, suggesting these prompts are not entirely opaque. Finally, some of the ablations we applied to autoprompts yield similar effects in natural language inputs, suggesting that autoprompts emerge naturally from the way LMs process linguistic inputs in general.

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) have achieved notable advancements, demonstrating the feasibility of developing an intelligent biomedical assistant. However, current biomedical MLLMs predominantly focus on image-level understanding and restrict interactions to textual commands, thus limiting their capability boundaries and the flexibility of usage. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end multimodal large language model for the biomedical domain, named MedPLIB, which possesses pixel-level understanding. Excitingly, it supports visual question answering (VQA), arbitrary pixel-level prompts (points, bounding boxes, and free-form shapes), and pixel-level grounding. We propose a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) multi-stage training strategy, which divides MoE into separate training phases for a visual-language expert model and a pixel-grounding expert model, followed by fine-tuning using MoE. This strategy effectively coordinates multitask learning while maintaining the computational cost at inference equivalent to that of a single expert model. To advance the research of biomedical MLLMs, we introduce the Medical Complex Vision Question Answering Dataset (MeCoVQA), which comprises an array of 8 modalities for complex medical imaging question answering and image region understanding. Experimental results indicate that MedPLIB has achieved state-of-the-art outcomes across multiple medical visual language tasks. More importantly, in zero-shot evaluations for the pixel grounding task, MedPLIB leads the best small and large models by margins of 19.7 and 15.6 respectively on the mDice metric. The codes, data, and model checkpoints will be made publicly available at https://github.com/ShawnHuang497/MedPLIB.

<title>KunServe: Parameter-centric Memory Management for Efficient Memory Overloading Handling in LLM Serving</title>

Abstract: Serving LLMs with a cluster of GPUs is common nowadays, where the serving system must meet strict latency SLOs required by applications. However, the stateful nature of LLM serving requires maintaining huge states (i.e., KVCache) in limited GPU memory. Under spikes in real-world workloads, GPU memory can be easily throttled, leading to orders of magnitude higher response latency due to queuing introduced by waiting for KVCache to be reclaimed. Prior KVCache-centric approaches handle load throttling by dropping, migrating, or swapping KVCache. These methods fail to release sufficient memory quickly with requests still queued.
  This paper proposes the first parameter-centric approach to handling throttling by selectively dropping replicated parameters to instantly free memory for requests, based on an unnoticed observation that model parameters are commonly replicated across GPUs for serving LLMs. With additional memory, all requests can be served with a larger batch without queuing. To make the parameter-centric approach correct and efficient, we cooperatively execute requests on GPUs with a complete copy of parameters using pipeline parallelism, and derive an appropriate drop plan without unnecessary cooperation. We also design techniques to minimize the performance overhead due to pipeline parallelism with the execution patterns of requests under drop. Evaluations show that {\sys} reduces the tail TTFT of requests under throttling by up to 72.2 times compared to the state-of-the-art systems including Llumnix, vLLM and InferCept.

<title>Tempo: Compiled Dynamic Deep Learning with Symbolic Dependence Graphs</title>

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) algorithms are often defined in terms of temporal relationships: a tensor at one timestep may depend on tensors from earlier or later timesteps. Such dynamic dependencies (and corresponding dynamic tensor shapes) are difficult to express and optimize: while eager DL systems support such dynamism, they cannot apply compiler-based optimizations; graph-based systems require static tensor shapes, which forces users to pad tensors or break-up programs into multiple static graphs.
  We describe Tempo, a new DL system that combines the dynamism of eager execution with the whole-program optimizations of graph-based compilation. Tempo achieves this through a declarative programming model with recurrent tensors, which include explicit temporal dimensions. Temporal dimensions can be indexed using symbolic expressions to express dynamic dependencies on past and future tensors. Based on this, Tempo constructs a symbolic dependence graph, which concisely encodes dynamic dependencies between operators, and applies whole-program optimizations, such as algebraic simplifications, vectorization, tiling, and fusion. By tiling dynamic dependencies into static-size blocks, Tempo can also reuse existing static code-generators. It then uses a polyhedral model to find a feasible execution schedule, which includes memory management operations. We show that Tempo achieves a 7$\times$ speedup over JAX for Llama-3.2-3B decoding; for reinforcement learning algorithms, Tempo achieves a 54$\times$ speedup, with 16$\times$ lower peak memory usage.

Abstract: Traditional Celluloid (Cel) Animation production pipeline encompasses multiple essential steps, including storyboarding, layout design, keyframe animation, inbetweening, and colorization, which demand substantial manual effort, technical expertise, and significant time investment. These challenges have historically impeded the efficiency and scalability of Cel-Animation production. The rise of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), encompassing large language models, multimodal models, and diffusion models, offers innovative solutions by automating tasks such as inbetween frame generation, colorization, and storyboard creation. This survey explores how GenAI integration is revolutionizing traditional animation workflows by lowering technical barriers, broadening accessibility for a wider range of creators through tools like AniDoc, ToonCrafter, and AniSora, and enabling artists to focus more on creative expression and artistic innovation. Despite its potential, challenges like visual consistency, stylistic coherence, and ethical considerations persist. Additionally, this paper explores future directions and advancements in AI-assisted animation.

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) aims to address the statistical heterogeneity of data across clients by learning the personalized model for each client. Among various PFL approaches, the personalized aggregation-based approach conducts parameter aggregation in the server-side aggregation phase to generate personalized models, and focuses on learning appropriate collaborative relationships among clients for aggregation. However, the collaborative relationships vary in different scenarios and even at different stages of the FL process. To this end, we propose Personalized Federated Learning with Attentive Graph HyperNetworks (FedAGHN), which employs Attentive Graph HyperNetworks (AGHNs) to dynamically capture fine-grained collaborative relationships and generate client-specific personalized initial models. Specifically, AGHNs empower graphs to explicitly model the client-specific collaborative relationships, construct collaboration graphs, and introduce tunable attentive mechanism to derive the collaboration weights, so that the personalized initial models can be obtained by aggregating parameters over the collaboration graphs. Extensive experiments can demonstrate the superiority of FedAGHN. Moreover, a series of visualizations are presented to explore the effectiveness of collaboration graphs learned by FedAGHN.

<title>A Dual-Agent Adversarial Framework for Robust Generalization in Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Recently, empowered with the powerful capabilities of neural networks, reinforcement learning (RL) has successfully tackled numerous challenging tasks. However, while these models demonstrate enhanced decision-making abilities, they are increasingly prone to overfitting. For instance, a trained RL model often fails to generalize to even minor variations of the same task, such as a change in background color or other minor semantic differences. To address this issue, we propose a dual-agent adversarial policy learning framework, which allows agents to spontaneously learn the underlying semantics without introducing any human prior knowledge. Specifically, our framework involves a game process between two agents: each agent seeks to maximize the impact of perturbing on the opponent's policy by producing representation differences for the same state, while maintaining its own stability against such perturbations. This interaction encourages agents to learn generalizable policies, capable of handling irrelevant features from the high-dimensional observations. Extensive experimental results on the Procgen benchmark demonstrate that the adversarial process significantly improves the generalization performance of both agents, while also being applied to various RL algorithms, e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). With the adversarial framework, the RL agent outperforms the baseline methods by a significant margin, especially in hard-level tasks, marking a significant step forward in the generalization capabilities of deep reinforcement learning.

<title>Achieving Hyperbolic-Like Expressiveness with Arbitrary Euclidean Regions: A New Approach to Hierarchical Embeddings</title>

Abstract: Hierarchical data is common in many domains like life sciences and e-commerce, and its embeddings often play a critical role. While hyperbolic embeddings offer a theoretically grounded approach to representing hierarchies in low-dimensional spaces, current methods often rely on specific geometric constructs as embedding candidates. This reliance limits their generalizability and makes it difficult to integrate with techniques that model semantic relationships beyond pure hierarchies, such as ontology embeddings. In this paper, we present RegD, a flexible Euclidean framework that supports the use of arbitrary geometric regions -- such as boxes and balls -- as embedding representations. Although RegD operates entirely in Euclidean space, we formally prove that it achieves hyperbolic-like expressiveness by incorporating a depth-based dissimilarity between regions, enabling it to emulate key properties of hyperbolic geometry, including exponential growth. Our empirical evaluation on diverse real-world datasets shows consistent performance gains over state-of-the-art methods and demonstrates RegD's potential for broader applications such as the ontology embedding task that goes beyond hierarchy.

Abstract: The ability to selectively remove knowledge from LLMs is highly desirable. However, existing methods often struggle with balancing unlearning efficacy and retain model utility, and lack controllability at inference time to emulate base model behavior as if it had never seen the unlearned data. In this paper, we propose LUNAR, a novel unlearning method grounded in the Linear Representation Hypothesis and operates by redirecting the representations of unlearned data to activation regions that expresses its inability to answer. We show that contrastive features are not a prerequisite for effective activation redirection, and LUNAR achieves state-of-the-art unlearning performance and superior controllability. Specifically, LUNAR achieves between 2.9x and 11.7x improvement in the combined unlearning efficacy and model utility score (Deviation Score) across various base models and generates coherent, contextually appropriate responses post-unlearning. Moreover, LUNAR effectively reduces parameter updates to a single down-projection matrix, a novel design that significantly enhances efficiency by 20x and robustness. Finally, we demonstrate that LUNAR is robust to white-box adversarial attacks and versatile in real-world scenarios, including handling sequential unlearning requests.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) have significantly advanced tasks such as multimodal question answering by grounding responses in external text and images. This grounding improves factuality, reduces hallucination, and extends reasoning beyond parametric knowledge. However, this reliance on external knowledge poses a critical yet underexplored safety risk: knowledge poisoning attacks, where adversaries deliberately inject adversarial multimodal content into external knowledge bases to steer model toward generating incorrect or even harmful responses. To expose such vulnerabilities, we propose MM-PoisonRAG, the first framework to systematically design knowledge poisoning in multimodal RAG. We introduce two complementary attack strategies: Localized Poisoning Attack (LPA), which implants targeted multimodal misinformation to manipulate specific queries, and Globalized Poisoning Attack (GPA), which inserts a single adversarial knowledge to broadly disrupt reasoning and induce nonsensical responses across all queries. Comprehensive experiments across tasks, models, and access settings show that LPA achieves targeted manipulation with attack success rates of up to 56%, while GPA completely disrupts model generation to 0% accuracy with just a single adversarial knowledge injection. Our results reveal the fragility of multimodal RAG and highlight the urgent need for defenses against knowledge poisoning.

Abstract: Over the past decades, there has been an explosion in the amount of available Earth Observation (EO) data. The unprecedented coverage of the Earth's surface and atmosphere by satellite imagery has resulted in large volumes of data that must be transmitted to ground stations, stored in data centers, and distributed to end users. Modern Earth System Models (ESMs) face similar challenges, operating at high spatial and temporal resolutions, producing petabytes of data per simulated day. Data compression has gained relevance over the past decade, with neural compression (NC) emerging from deep learning and information theory, making EO data and ESM outputs ideal candidates due to their abundance of unlabeled data. In this review, we outline recent developments in NC applied to geospatial data. We introduce the fundamental concepts of NC including seminal works in its traditional applications to image and video compression domains with focus on lossy compression. We discuss the unique characteristics of EO and ESM data, contrasting them with "natural images", and explain the additional challenges and opportunities they present. Moreover, we review current applications of NC across various EO modalities and explore the limited efforts in ESM compression to date. The advent of self-supervised learning (SSL) and foundation models (FM) has advanced methods to efficiently distill representations from vast unlabeled data. We connect these developments to NC for EO, highlighting the similarities between the two fields and elaborate on the potential of transferring compressed feature representations for machine--to--machine communication. Based on insights drawn from this review, we devise future directions relevant to applications in EO and ESM.

Abstract: Social biases and belief-driven behaviors can significantly impact Large Language Models (LLMs) decisions on several tasks. As LLMs are increasingly used in multi-agent systems for societal simulations, their ability to model fundamental group psychological characteristics remains critical yet under-explored. In this study, we present a multi-agent framework that simulates belief congruence, a classical group psychology theory that plays a crucial role in shaping societal interactions and preferences. Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit amplified belief congruence compared to humans, across diverse contexts. We further investigate the implications of this behavior on two downstream tasks: (1) misinformation dissemination and (2) LLM learning, finding that belief congruence in LLMs increases misinformation dissemination and impedes learning. To mitigate these negative impacts, we propose strategies inspired by: (1) contact hypothesis, (2) accuracy nudges, and (3) global citizenship framework. Our results show that the best strategies reduce misinformation dissemination by up to 37% and enhance learning by 11%. Bridging social psychology and AI, our work provides insights to navigate real-world interactions using LLMs while addressing belief-driven biases.

Abstract: The paper shows that parameter-efficient reinforcement learning (PE-RL) is a highly effective training regime to improve large language models' (LLMs) ability to answer queries on sensitive topics with a Neutral Point of View (NPOV), i.e. to provide significantly more informative, diverse and impartial answers. This is shown by evaluating PE-RL and multiple strong baselines-including LoRA finetuning (strongest baseline), SFT and RLHF. PE-RL not only improves on overall NPOV quality compared to the strongest baseline ($97.06\%\rightarrow 99.08\%$), but also scores much higher on features linguists identify as key to separating sufficient answers from "great'' answers ($60.25\%\rightarrow 85.21\%$ for presence of supportive details, $68.74\%\rightarrow 91.43\%$ for absence of oversimplification). A qualitative analysis corroborates this. Moreover, our evaluation also finds a key property of PE-RL for this task: unlike methods that update all parameters, it generalises out of topic. Finally, to enable further studies we also release the dataset, SHQ-NPOV, and provide a methodology to create such datasets through iterative rounds of human peer-critique and annotator training.

Abstract: We investigate the use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with in-context learning for closed-loop task planning in instruction-following manipulation. We identify four essential requirements for successful task planning: quantity estimation, reachability analysis, relative positioning, and collision avoidance. However, existing benchmarks fail to support holistic evaluation across all these aspects. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{QuARC} (Quantity, Analysis, Relative positioning, Collision), a new benchmark based on a food preparation scenario that integrates all four challenges. Using QuARC, we reveal two major limitations of current MLLMs: cross-modal distraction and geometric infeasibility. To tackle these, we adapt Chain-of-Thought with Self-Consistency to mitigate reasoning loss from cross-modal distractions and incorporate an affordance predictor to guide planning based on geometric feasibility. Our comprehensive evaluation analyzes performance across multiple baselines and explains sources of improvement. Our method achieves a 76.7\% success rate on the benchmark, significantly outperforming the ViLa baseline (36.7\%), without requiring additional finetuning.

arXiv:2503.17353v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In deep learning, processing multidimensional inputs (e.g., images, medical scans, and time series) is an important task that often requires flattening the inputs. We introduce $\mathit{NdLinear}$, a drop-in replacement for linear layers that operates directly on tensors, requiring no flattening. By applying transformations separately along each dimension, NdLinear preserves native data structure while achieving dramatic parameter reductions, often by orders of magnitude, with minimal memory overhead. We prove NdLinear maintains expressivity through structured Tucker decomposition while preserving VC-dimension scaling. Extensive experiments demonstrate NdLinear's capacity to achieve significant parameter reductions with substantial wall-clock efficiency gains and minimal memory overhead. For instance, our $\mathit{NdLinear-LoRA}$ matches or exceeds standard LoRA on language reasoning tasks using up to $9\times$ fewer parameters. Experiments across CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, and MLPs on vision, language, time-series, and tabular tasks consistently demonstrate NdLinear's efficiency gains. While excelling at axis-separable tasks, NdLinear has limitations with entangled spatial interactions. By processing data in its original N-dimensional form, NdLinear provides a theoretically grounded, practical component for building more efficient neural architectures.

Abstract: Mammography, an X-ray-based imaging technique, remains central to the early detection of breast cancer. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have enabled increasingly sophisticated computer-aided diagnostic methods, evolving from patch-based classifiers to whole-image approaches and then to multi-view architectures that jointly analyze complementary projections. Despite this progress, several critical questions remain unanswered. In this study, we systematically investigate these issues by addressing five key research questions: (1) the role of patch classifiers in performance, (2) the transferability of natural-image-trained backbones, (3) the advantages of learn-to-resize over conventional downscaling, (4) the contribution of multi-view integration, and (5) the robustness of findings across varying image quality. Beyond benchmarking, our experiments demonstrate clear performance gains over prior work. For the CBIS-DDSM dataset, we improved single-view AUC from 0.8153 to 0.8343, and multiple-view AUC from 0.8483 to 0.8658. Using a new comparative method, we also observed a 0.0217 AUC increase when extending from single to multiple-view analysis. On the complete VinDr-Mammo dataset, the multiple-view approach further improved results, achieving a 0.0492 AUC increase over single view and reaching 0.8511 AUC overall. These results establish new state-of-the-art benchmarks, providing clear evidence of the advantages of multi-view architectures for mammogram interpretation. Beyond performance, our analysis offers principled insights into model design and transfer learning strategies, contributing to the development of more accurate and reliable breast cancer screening tools.

Abstract: Visual grounding (VG) aims to localize target objects in an image based on natural language descriptions. In this paper, we propose AerialVG, a new task focusing on visual grounding from aerial views. Compared to traditional VG, AerialVG poses new challenges, \emph{e.g.}, appearance-based grounding is insufficient to distinguish among multiple visually similar objects, and positional relations should be emphasized. Besides, existing VG models struggle when applied to aerial imagery, where high-resolution images cause significant difficulties. To address these challenges, we introduce the first AerialVG dataset, consisting of 5K real-world aerial images, 50K manually annotated descriptions, and 103K objects. Particularly, each annotation in AerialVG dataset contains multiple target objects annotated with relative spatial relations, requiring models to perform comprehensive spatial reasoning. Furthermore, we propose an innovative model especially for the AerialVG task, where a Hierarchical Cross-Attention is devised to focus on target regions, and a Relation-Aware Grounding module is designed to infer positional relations. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our dataset and method, highlighting the importance of spatial reasoning in aerial visual grounding. The code and dataset will be released.

Abstract: We investigate a failure mode that arises during the training of reasoning models, where the diversity of generations begins to collapse, leading to suboptimal test-time scaling. Notably, the Pass@1 rate reliably improves during supervised finetuning (SFT), but Pass@k rapidly deteriorates. Surprisingly, a simple intervention of interpolating the weights of the latest SFT checkpoint with an early checkpoint, otherwise known as WiSE-FT, almost completely recovers Pass@k while also improving Pass@1. The WiSE-FT variant achieves better test-time scaling (Best@k, majority vote) and achieves superior results with less data when tuned further by reinforcement learning. Finally, we find that WiSE-FT provides complementary performance gains that cannot be achieved only through diversity-inducing decoding strategies, like temperature scaling. We formalize a bias-variance tradeoff of Pass@k with respect to the expectation and variance of Pass@1 over the test distribution. We find that WiSE-FT can reduce bias and variance simultaneously, while temperature scaling inherently trades off between bias and variance.

<title>Efficient Flow Matching using Latent Variables</title>

Abstract: Flow matching models have shown great potential in image generation tasks among probabilistic generative models. However, most flow matching models in the literature do not explicitly utilize the underlying clustering structure in the target data when learning the flow from a simple source distribution like the standard Gaussian. This leads to inefficient learning, especially for many high-dimensional real-world datasets, which often reside in a low-dimensional manifold. To this end, we present $\texttt{Latent-CFM}$, which provides efficient training strategies by conditioning on the features extracted from data using pretrained deep latent variable models. Through experiments on synthetic data from multi-modal distributions and widely used image benchmark datasets, we show that $\texttt{Latent-CFM}$ exhibits improved generation quality with significantly less training and computation than state-of-the-art flow matching models by adopting pretrained lightweight latent variable models. Beyond natural images, we consider generative modeling of spatial fields stemming from physical processes. Using a 2d Darcy flow dataset, we demonstrate that our approach generates more physically accurate samples than competing approaches. In addition, through latent space analysis, we demonstrate that our approach can be used for conditional image generation conditioned on latent features, which adds interpretability to the generation process.

Abstract: In this work, we present GPDiT, a Generative Pre-trained Autoregressive Diffusion Transformer that unifies the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive modeling for long-range video synthesis, within a continuous latent space. Instead of predicting discrete tokens, GPDiT autoregressively predicts future latent frames using a diffusion loss, enabling natural modeling of motion dynamics and semantic consistency across frames. This continuous autoregressive framework not only enhances generation quality but also endows the model with representation capabilities. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight causal attention variant and a parameter-free rotation-based time-conditioning mechanism, improving both the training and inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPDiT achieves strong performance in video generation quality, video representation ability, and few-shot learning tasks, highlighting its potential as an effective framework for video modeling in continuous space.

Abstract: The growing use of smartphones and IoT devices necessitates efficient time-series analysis on resource-constrained hardware, which is critical for sensing applications such as human activity recognition and air quality prediction. Recent efforts in hardware-aware neural architecture search (NAS) automate architecture discovery for specific platforms; however, none focus on general time-series analysis with edge deployment. Leveraging the problem-solving and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLM), we propose MONAQ, a novel framework that reformulates NAS into Multi-Objective Neural Architecture Querying tasks. MONAQ is equipped with multimodal query generation for processing multimodal time-series inputs and hardware constraints, alongside an LLM agent-based multi-objective search to achieve deployment-ready models via code generation. By integrating numerical data, time-series images, and textual descriptions, MONAQ improves an LLM's understanding of time-series data. Experiments on fifteen datasets demonstrate that MONAQ-discovered models outperform both handcrafted models and NAS baselines while being more efficient.

Abstract: Corporate LLMs are gaining traction for efficient knowledge dissemination and management within organizations. However, as current LLMs are vulnerable to leaking sensitive information, it has proven difficult to apply them in settings where strict access control is necessary. To this end, we design AC-LoRA, an end-to-end system for access control-aware corporate LLM chatbots that maintains a strong information isolation guarantee. AC-LoRA maintains separate LoRA adapters for permissioned datasets, along with the document embedding they are finetuned on. AC-LoRA retrieves a precise set of LoRA adapters based on the similarity score with the user query and their permission. This similarity score is later used to merge the responses if more than one LoRA is retrieved, without requiring any additional training for LoRA routing. We provide an end-to-end prototype of AC-LoRA, evaluate it on two datasets, and show that AC-LoRA matches or even exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art LoRA mixing techniques while providing strong isolation guarantees. Furthermore, we show that AC-LoRA design can be directly applied to different modalities.

<title>AdaDim: Dimensionality Adaptation for SSL Representational Dynamics</title>

arXiv:2505.12576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key factor in effective Self-Supervised learning (SSL) is preventing dimensional collapse, where higher-dimensional representation spaces ($R$) span a lower-dimensional subspace. Therefore, SSL optimization strategies involve guiding a model to produce $R$ with a higher dimensionality ($H(R)$) through objectives that encourage decorrelation of features or sample uniformity in $R$. A higher $H(R)$ indicates that $R$ has greater feature diversity which is useful for generalization to downstream tasks. Alongside dimensionality optimization, SSL algorithms also utilize a projection head that maps $R$ into an embedding space $Z$. Recent work has characterized the projection head as a filter of noisy or irrelevant features from the SSL objective by reducing the mutual information $I(R;Z)$. Therefore, the current literature's view is that a good SSL representation space should have a high $H(R)$ and a low $I(R;Z)$. However, this view of SSL is lacking in terms of an understanding of the underlying training dynamics that influences the relationship between both terms. Our analysis shows that the best performing SSL models do not have the highest $H(R)$ nor the lowest $I(R;Z)$, but effectively arrive at a balance between both. To take advantage of this analysis, we introduce AdaDim, a training strategy that leverages SSL training dynamics by adaptively balancing between increasing $H(R)$ through feature decorrelation and sample uniformity as well as gradual regularization of $I(R;Z)$ as training progresses. We show performance improvements of up to 3% over common SSL baselines despite our method not utilizing expensive techniques such as queues, clustering, predictor networks, or student-teacher architectures.

<title>MoRE-Brain: Routed Mixture of Experts for Interpretable and Generalizable Cross-Subject fMRI Visual Decoding</title>

arXiv:2505.15946v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decoding visual experiences from fMRI offers a powerful avenue to understand human perception and develop advanced brain-computer interfaces. However, current progress often prioritizes maximizing reconstruction fidelity while overlooking interpretability, an essential aspect for deriving neuroscientific insight. To address this gap, we propose MoRE-Brain, a neuro-inspired framework designed for high-fidelity, adaptable, and interpretable visual reconstruction. MoRE-Brain uniquely employs a hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts architecture where distinct experts process fMRI signals from functionally related voxel groups, mimicking specialized brain networks. The experts are first trained to encode fMRI into the frozen CLIP space. A finetuned diffusion model then synthesizes images, guided by expert outputs through a novel dual-stage routing mechanism that dynamically weighs expert contributions across the diffusion process. MoRE-Brain offers three main advancements: First, it introduces a novel Mixture-of-Experts architecture grounded in brain network principles for neuro-decoding. Second, it achieves efficient cross-subject generalization by sharing core expert networks while adapting only subject-specific routers. Third, it provides enhanced mechanistic insight, as the explicit routing reveals precisely how different modeled brain regions shape the semantic and spatial attributes of the reconstructed image. Extensive experiments validate MoRE-Brain's high reconstruction fidelity, with bottleneck analyses further demonstrating its effective utilization of fMRI signals, distinguishing genuine neural decoding from over-reliance on generative priors. Consequently, MoRE-Brain marks a substantial advance towards more generalizable and interpretable fMRI-based visual decoding. Code will be publicly available soon: https://github.com/yuxiangwei0808/MoRE-Brain.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems have advanced large language models (LLMs) in complex deep search scenarios requiring multi-step reasoning and iterative information retrieval. However, existing approaches face critical limitations that lack high-quality training trajectories or suffer from the distributional mismatches in simulated environments and prohibitive computational costs for real-world deployment. This paper introduces SimpleDeepSearcher, a lightweight yet effective framework that bridges this gap through strategic data engineering rather than complex training paradigms. Our approach synthesizes high-quality training data by simulating realistic user interactions in live web search environments, coupled with a multi-criteria curation strategy that optimizes the diversity and quality of input and output side. Experiments on five benchmarks across diverse domains demonstrate that SFT on only 871 curated samples yields significant improvements over RL-based baselines. Our work establishes SFT as a viable pathway by systematically addressing the data-scarce bottleneck, offering practical insights for efficient deep search systems. Our code is available at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/SimpleDeepSearcher.

arXiv:2505.17967v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-rank optimization has emerged as a promising direction in training large language models (LLMs) to improve running time and reduce the memory usage of adaptive optimizers by constraining learning to a lower-dimensional space. Prior work typically projects gradients of linear layers using approaches based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or QR-decomposition. Applying these techniques individually to each layer in large models is computationally expensive and incurs additional memory costs due to storing the projection matrices. In this work, we propose a computationally efficient and conceptually simple, two-step procedure to approximate SVD/QR-based gradient projections into lower-dimensional spaces by using a predefined orthogonal matrix of the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). We dynamically select columns from the DCT matrix based on their alignment with the gradient of each layer. The effective projection matrices are obtained via a simple matmul with the DCT matrix in $O(n^3)$ time, followed by a lightweight sorting step to identify the most relevant basis vectors. For large layers, DCT can be computed via Makhoul's $N$-point algorithm based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in $O(n^2 \log(n))$ time. Due to the predefined nature of the orthogonal bases, they are computed once at the start of training. Our numerical experiments on both pre-training and fine-tuning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our dual strategy in approximating optimal low-rank projections, obtaining an approach with rank-independent running time that matches the performance of costly SVD/QR-based methods while achieving faster runtime and reduced memory usage by up to $25\%$ across different model sizes.

<title>The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Model Merging for Cross-Lingual Transfer in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) still struggle across tasks outside of high-resource languages. In this work, we investigate cross-lingual transfer to lower-resource languages where task-specific post-training data is scarce. Building on prior work, we first validate that the subsets of model parameters that matter most for mathematical reasoning and multilingual capabilities are distinctly non-overlapping. To exploit this implicit separability between task and target language parameterization, we develop and analyze numerous modular frameworks to improve the composition of the two during fine-tuning. These methods generally employ freezing parameters or post hoc model merging to assign math and language improvement to different key parts of the LLM. In the absence of in-language math data, we demonstrate that the modular approaches successfully improve upon baselines across three languages, four models, and two fine-tuning paradigms (full and LoRA). Furthermore, we identify the most consistently successful modular method to be fine-tuning separate language and math experts and model merging via Layer-Swapping, somewhat surprisingly. We offer possible explanations for this result via recent works on the linearity of task vectors. We further explain this by empirically showing that reverting less useful fine-tuning updates after training often outperforms freezing them from the start.

Abstract: Recent years have seen a rise in the application of machine learning techniques to aid the simulation of hard-to-sample systems that cannot be studied using traditional methods. Despite the introduction of many different architectures and procedures, a wide theoretical understanding is still lacking, with the risk of suboptimal implementations. As a first step to address this gap, we provide here a complete analytic study of the widely-used Sequential Tempering procedure applied to a shallow MADE architecture for the Curie-Weiss model. The contribution of this work is twofold: firstly, we give a description of the optimal weights and of the training under Gradient Descent optimization. Secondly, we compare what happens in Sequential Tempering with and without the addition of local Metropolis Monte Carlo steps. We are thus able to give theoretical predictions on the best procedure to apply in this case. This work establishes a clear theoretical basis for the integration of machine learning techniques into Monte Carlo sampling and optimization.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in domains such as visual understanding and mathematical reasoning. However, their application in the medical domain is constrained by two key challenges: (1) multimodal medical datasets are scarce and often contain sparse information, limiting reasoning depth; and (2) Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), though effective in general domains, cannot reliably improve model performance in the medical domain. To overcome these challenges, during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, we incorporate high-quality textual reasoning data and general multimodal data alongside multimodal medical data to efficiently enhance foundational medical capabilities and restore the base model's reasoning ability. Moreover, considering that there are some multimodal medical datasets with sparse information, we further synthesize reflective-pattern-injected chain-of-thought (CoT) in addition to general CoT samples, equipping the model with initial reflective reasoning capabilities that provide a structured foundation for subsequent RLVR training. Finally, we introduce our InfiMed-Series models, InfiMed-SFT-3B and InfiMed-RL-3B, both of which deliver state-of-the-art performance across seven multimodal medical benchmarks. Notably, InfiMed-RL-3B achieves an average accuracy of 59.2%, outperforming even larger models like InternVL3-8B, which achieves 57.3%. Specifically, during the SFT phase, we utilized 188K samples, while the RLVR phase incorporated 36K samples, demonstrating the efficacy of both training strategies in achieving superior performance. We also conducted a series of extensive experiments, which provide valuable insights that contribute to advancing the performance of MLLMs in medical scenarios.

Abstract: Modern neural networks (NN) contain an ever-growing number of parameters, substantially increasing the memory and computational cost of inference. Researchers have explored various ways to reduce the inference cost of NNs by reducing the model size before deployment and dynamically pruning the inference computation at runtime. In this work, we present ExPrune, a general, dynamic pruning optimization that enables multi-granularity partial computation on a per-input basis. ExPrune requires no change to the model architecture or the training algorithm. ExPrune is based on our theoretical results that the relationship between certain model parameters and intermediate values can be described by a statistical property called exchangeability. By identifying exchangeable parameters and values in the model, we are able to first partially evaluate the network, analyze the statistics of the partial results, and make pruning decisions on the fly. Because ExPrune is theory grounded, it generalizes across model architectures in different problem domains. We evaluate ExPrune on one computer vision models, one graph model and one language model. ExPrune provides 10.98--17.33% reduction in FLOPs with negligible accuracy drop and 21.61--27.16% reduction in FLOPs with at most 1% accuracy drop. We also demonstrate that ExPrune composes with static magnitude pruning. On models that have been aggressively statically pruned, ExPrune still provides additional 10.24--11.11% reduction in FLOPs with negligible accuracy drop and 13.91--14.39% reduction in FLOPs with at most 1% accuracy drop.

Abstract: AI agents have significant potential to reshape cybersecurity, making a thorough assessment of their capabilities critical. However, existing evaluations fall short, because they are based on small-scale benchmarks and only measure static outcomes, failing to capture the full, dynamic range of real-world security challenges. To address these limitations, we introduce CyberGym, a large-scale benchmark featuring 1,507 real-world vulnerabilities across 188 software projects. Adjustable to different vulnerability analysis settings, CyberGym primarily tasks agents with generating a proof-of-concept test that reproduces a vulnerability, given only its text description and the corresponding codebase. Our extensive evaluation highlights that CyberGym effectively differentiates agents' and models' cybersecurity capabilities. Even the top-performing combinations only achieve a ~20% success rate, demonstrating the overall difficulty of CyberGym. Beyond static benchmarking, we show that CyberGym leads to the discovery of 35 zero-day vulnerabilities and 17 historically incomplete patches. These results underscore that CyberGym is not only a robust benchmark for measuring AI's progress in cybersecurity but also a platform for creating direct, real-world security impact.

Abstract: Adaptive recovery from fall incidents are essential skills for the practical deployment of wheeled-legged robots, which uniquely combine the agility of legs with the speed of wheels for rapid recovery. However, traditional methods relying on preplanned recovery motions, simplified dynamics or sparse rewards often fail to produce robust recovery policies. This paper presents a learning-based framework integrating Episode-based Dynamic Reward Shaping and curriculum learning, which dynamically balances exploration of diverse recovery maneuvers with precise posture refinement. An asymmetric actor-critic architecture accelerates training by leveraging privileged information in simulation, while noise-injected observations enhance robustness against uncertainties. We further demonstrate that synergistic wheel-leg coordination reduces joint torque consumption by 15.8% and 26.2% and improves stabilization through energy transfer mechanisms. Extensive evaluations on two distinct quadruped platforms achieve recovery success rates up to 99.1% and 97.8% without platform-specific tuning.

Abstract: Constructing real-world data-to-insight pipelines often involves data extraction from data lakes, data integration across heterogeneous data sources, and diverse operations from data cleaning to analysis. The design and implementation of data science pipelines require domain knowledge, technical expertise, and even project-specific insights. AI systems have shown remarkable reasoning, coding, and understanding capabilities. However, it remains unclear to what extent these capabilities translate into successful design and execution of such complex pipelines. We introduce KRAMABENCH: a benchmark composed of 104 manually-curated real-world data science pipelines spanning 1700 data files from 24 data sources in 6 different domains. We show that these pipelines test the end-to-end capabilities of AI systems on data processing, requiring data discovery, wrangling and cleaning, efficient processing, statistical reasoning, and orchestrating data processing steps given a high-level task. Our evaluation tests 5 general models and 3 code generation models using our reference framework, DS-GURU, which instructs the AI model to decompose a question into a sequence of subtasks, reason through each step, and synthesize Python code that implements the proposed design. Our results on KRAMABENCH show that, although the models are sufficiently capable of solving well-specified data science code generation tasks, when extensive data processing and domain knowledge are required to construct real-world data science pipelines, existing out-of-box models fall short. Progress on KramaBench represents crucial steps towards developing autonomous data science agents for real-world applications. Our code, reference framework, and data are available at https://github.com/mitdbg/KramaBench.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing real-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.

Abstract: As AI models generate increasingly realistic images, growing concerns over potential misuse underscore the need for reliable detection. Traditional supervised detection methods depend on large, curated datasets for training and often fail to generalize to novel, out-of-domain image generators. As an alternative, we explore pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for zero-shot detection of AI-generated images. We evaluate VLM performance on three diverse benchmarks encompassing synthetic images of human faces, objects, and animals produced by 16 different state-of-the-art image generators. While off-the-shelf VLMs perform poorly on these datasets, we find that their reasoning can be guided effectively through simple response prefilling -- a method we call Prefill-Guided Thinking (PGT). In particular, prefilling a VLM response with the task-aligned phrase "Let's examine the style and the synthesis artifacts" improves the Macro F1 scores of three widely used open-source VLMs by up to 24%.

On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs)-based planners leverage commonsense reasoning, yet frequently propose actions that are unfeasible or unsafe. Following recent works that combine the two approaches, we introduce ContextMatters, a framework that fuses LLMs and classical planning to perform hierarchical goal relaxation: the LLM helps ground symbols to the scene and, when the target is unreachable, it proposes functionally equivalent goals that progressively relax constraints, adapting the goal to the context of the agent's environment. Operating on 3D Scene Graphs, this mechanism turns many nominally unfeasible tasks into tractable plans and enables context-aware partial achievement when full completion is not achievable. Our experimental results show a +52.45% Success Rate improvement over state-of-the-art LLMs+PDDL baseline, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Moreover, we validate the execution of ContextMatter in a real world scenario by deploying it on a TIAGo robot. Code, dataset, and supplementary materials are available to the community at https://lab-rococo-sapienza.github.io/context-matters/.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly employed to automate complex software engineering tasks, such as program repair and issue resolution. These agents operate by autonomously generating natural language thoughts, invoking external tools, and iteratively refining their solutions. Despite their widespread adoption, the internal decision-making processes of these agents remain largely unexplored, limiting our understanding of their operational dynamics and failure modes. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study of the thought-action-result trajectories of three state-of-the-art LLM-based agents: RepairAgent, AutoCodeRover, and OpenHands. We unify their interaction logs into a common format, capturing 120 trajectories and 2,822 LLM interactions focused on program repair and issue resolution. Our study combines quantitative analyses of structural properties, action patterns, and token usage with qualitative assessments of reasoning coherence and feedback integration. We identify key trajectory characteristics, such as iteration counts and token consumption, recurring action sequences, and the semantic coherence of thoughts, actions, and their results. Our findings reveal behavioral motifs and anti-patterns that distinguish successful from failed executions, providing actionable insights for improving agent design, including prompting strategies, failure diagnosis, and anti-pattern detection. We release our dataset and annotation framework to support further research on transparent and robust autonomous software engineering agents.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning language models -- particularly those that use long, latent chains of thought -- have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex, agentic tasks. However, as these models operate over increasingly extended time horizons, their internal progress becomes opaque to users, complicating expectation management and real-time oversight. In this work, we investigate whether real-time progress prediction is feasible. We discretize progress and train a linear probe to classify reasoning states. We then introduce a two-stage fine-tuning approach that enables reasoning models to generate progress estimates (0$\rightarrow$100\%) during inference. Our best fine-tuned model achieves an average error of 10\% for sequences less than 16,000 tokens, offering a practical mechanism for monitoring and interpreting model reasoning in real time.

<title>Structure-Aware Compound-Protein Affinity Prediction via Graph Neural Network with Group Lasso Regularization</title>

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approaches have been increasingly applied in drug discovery to learn molecular representations and identify substructures driving property predictions. However, building end-to-end explainable models for structure-activity relationship (SAR) modeling for compound property prediction faces many challenges, such as the limited number of compound-protein interaction activity data for specific protein targets, and plenty of subtle changes in molecular configuration sites significantly affecting molecular properties. We exploit pairs of molecules with activity cliffs that share scaffolds but differ at substituent sites, characterized by large potency differences for specific protein targets. We propose a framework by implementing graph neural networks (GNNs) to leverage property and structure information from activity cliff pairs to predict compound-protein affinity (i.e., half maximal inhibitory concentration, IC50). To enhance model performance and explainability, we train GNNs with structure-aware loss functions using group lasso and sparse group lasso regularizations, which prune and highlight molecular subgraphs relevant to activity differences. We applied this framework to activity cliff data of molecules targeting three proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src proteins (PDB IDs: 1O42, 2H8H, 4MXO). Our approach improved property prediction by integrating common and uncommon node information with sparse group lasso, as reflected in reduced root mean squared error (RMSE) and improved Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC). Applying regularizations also enhances feature attribution for GNN by boosting graph-level global direction scores and improving atom-level coloring accuracy. These advances strengthen model interpretability in drug discovery pipelines, particularly for identifying critical molecular substructures in lead optimization.

<title>Enjoying Non-linearity in Multinomial Logistic Bandits</title>

Abstract: We consider the multinomial logistic bandit problem, a variant of where a learner interacts with an environment by selecting actions to maximize expected rewards based on probabilistic feedback from multiple possible outcomes. In the binary setting, recent work has focused on understanding the impact of the non-linearity of the logistic model (Faury et al., 2020; Abeille et al., 2021). They introduced a problem-dependent constant $\kappa_* \geq 1$, that may be exponentially large in some problem parameters and which is captured by the derivative of the sigmoid function. It encapsulates the non-linearity and improves existing regret guarantees over $T$ rounds from $\smash{O(d\sqrt{T})}$ to $\smash{O(d\sqrt{T/\kappa_*})}$, where $d$ is the dimension of the parameter space. We extend their analysis to the multinomial logistic bandit framework, making it suitable for complex applications with more than two choices, such as reinforcement learning or recommender systems. To achieve this, we extend the definition of \( \kappa_* \) to the multinomial setting and propose an efficient algorithm that leverages the problem's non-linearity. Our method yields a problem-dependent regret bound of order $ \smash{\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}( R d \sqrt{{KT}/{\kappa_*}})} $, where $R$ is the norm of the vector of rewards and $K$ is the number of outcomes. This improves upon the best existing guarantees of order $ \smash{\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}( RdK \sqrt{T} )} $. Moreover, we provide a $\smash{ \Omega(Rd\sqrt{KT/\kappa_*})}$ lower-bound, showing that our algorithm is minimax-optimal and that our definition of $\kappa_*$ is optimal.

Abstract: Audio inpainting seeks to restore missing segments in degraded recordings. Previous diffusion-based methods exhibit impaired performance when the missing region is large. We introduce the first approach that applies discrete diffusion over tokenized music representations from a pre-trained audio tokenizer, enabling stable and semantically coherent restoration of long gaps. Our method further incorporates two training approaches: a derivative-based regularization loss that enforces smooth temporal dynamics, and a span-based absorbing transition that provides structured corruption during diffusion. Experiments on the MusicNet and MAESTRO datasets with gaps up to 750 ms show that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines across range of gap lengths, for gaps of 150 ms and above. This work advances musical audio restoration and introduces new directions for discrete diffusion model training. Audio examples of our proposed method can be found at https://iftach21.github.io/.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) seeks to exploit the intrinsic properties of quantum mechanical systems, including superposition, coherence, and quantum entanglement for classical data processing. However, due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space, QML faces practical limits in classical simulations with the state-vector representation of quantum system. On the other hand, phase-space methods offer an alternative by encoding quantum states as quasi-probability functions. Building on prior work in qubit phase-space and the Stratonovich-Weyl (SW) correspondence, we construct a closed, composable dynamical formalism for one- and many-qubit systems in phase-space. This formalism replaces the operator algebra of the Pauli group with function dynamics on symplectic manifolds, and recasts the curse of dimensionality in terms of harmonic support on a domain that scales linearly with the number of qubits. It opens a new route for QML based on variational modelling over phase-space.

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) has demonstrated the significant help of visual information in machine translation. However, existing MMT methods face challenges in leveraging the modality gap by enforcing rigid visual-linguistic alignment whilst being confined to inference within their trained multimodal domains. In this work, we construct novel multimodal scene graphs to preserve and integrate modality-specific information and introduce GIIFT, a two-stage Graph-guided Inductive Image-Free MMT framework that uses a cross-modal Graph Attention Network adapter to learn multimodal knowledge in a unified fused space and inductively generalize it to broader image-free translation domains. Experimental results on the Multi30K dataset of English-to-French and English-to-German tasks demonstrate that our GIIFT surpasses existing approaches and achieves the state-of-the-art, even without images during inference. Results on the WMT benchmark show significant improvements over the image-free translation baselines, demonstrating the strength of GIIFT towards inductive image-free inference.

Abstract: Missing data in financial panels presents a critical obstacle, undermining asset-pricing models and reducing the effectiveness of investment strategies. Such panels are often inherently multi-dimensional, spanning firms, time, and financial variables, which adds complexity to the imputation task. Conventional imputation methods often fail by flattening the data's multidimensional structure, struggling with heterogeneous missingness patterns, or overfitting in the face of extreme data sparsity. To address these limitations, we introduce an Adaptive, Cluster-based Temporal smoothing tensor completion framework (ACT-Tensor) tailored for severely and heterogeneously missing multi-dimensional financial data panels. ACT-Tensor incorporates two key innovations: a cluster-based completion module that captures cross-sectional heterogeneity by learning group-specific latent structures; and a temporal smoothing module that proactively removes short-lived noise while preserving slow-moving fundamental trends. Extensive experiments show that ACT-Tensor consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in terms of imputation accuracy across a range of missing data regimes, including extreme sparsity scenarios. To assess its practical financial utility, we evaluate the imputed data with an asset-pricing pipeline tailored for tensor-structured financial data. Results show that ACT-Tensor not only reduces pricing errors but also significantly improves risk-adjusted returns of the constructed portfolio. These findings confirm that our method delivers highly accurate and informative imputations, offering substantial value for financial decision-making.

Abstract: Discovering quasi-cliques -- subgraphs whose edge density exceeds a given threshold -- is a fundamental task in graph mining with applications to web spam detection, fraud screening, and e-commerce recommendation. However, existing methods for quasi-clique discovery on large-scale web graphs are often sensitive to random seeds or lack of explicit edge-density guarantees, making the task challenging in practice. This paper presents EDQC, an energy diffusion-based method for quasi-clique discovery. EDQC first employs an adaptive energy diffusion process to generate an energy ranking that highlights structurally cohesive regions. Guided by this energy ranking, the algorithm identifies a high-quality subgraph by minimizing conductance, a standard measure from community detection. This subgraph is then refined to meet the specified density threshold. Extensive experiments on 75 real-world graphs show that EDQC finds larger quasi-cliques on most datasets, with consistently lower variance across runs and competitive runtime. To the best of our knowledge, EDQC is the first method to incorporate energy diffusion into quasi-clique discovery.

Abstract: Predictions and generations from large language models are increasingly being explored as an aid in limited data regimes, such as in computational social science and human subjects research. While prior technical work has mainly explored the potential to use model-predicted labels for unlabeled data in a principled manner, there is increasing interest in using large language models to generate entirely new synthetic samples (e.g., synthetic simulations), such as in responses to surveys. However, it remains unclear by what means practitioners can combine such data with real data and yet produce statistically valid conclusions upon them. In this paper, we introduce a new estimator based on generalized method of moments, providing a hyperparameter-free solution with strong theoretical guarantees to address this challenge. Intriguingly, we find that interactions between the moment residuals of synthetic data and those of real data (i.e., when they are predictive of each other) can greatly improve estimates of the target parameter. We validate the finite-sample performance of our estimator across different tasks in computational social science applications, demonstrating large empirical gains.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a systematic framework beyond conventional method to assess LLMs' mathematical-reasoning robustness by stress-testing them on advanced math problems that are mathematically equivalent but with linguistic and parametric variation. These transformations allow us to measure the sensitivity of LLMs to non-mathematical perturbations, thereby enabling a more accurate evaluation of their mathematical reasoning capabilities. Using this new evaluation methodology, we created PutnamGAP, a new benchmark dataset with multiple mathematically-equivalent variations of competition-level math problems. With the new dataset, we evaluate multiple families of representative LLMs and examine their robustness. Across 18 commercial and open-source models we observe sharp performance degradation on the variants. OpenAI's flagship reasoning model, O3, scores 51.5% on the originals but drops by 4.7 percentage points on surface-renaming variants, and by 12.9 percentage points on parametric variants, while smaller models fare far worse. Overall, the results show that the proposed new evaluation methodology is effective for deepening our understanding of the robustness of LLMs and generating new insights for further improving their mathematical reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: As intelligent robots become more integrated into human environments, there is a growing need for intuitive and reliable Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) interfaces that are adaptable and more natural to interact with. Traditional robot control methods often require users to adapt to interfaces or memorize predefined commands, limiting usability in dynamic, unstructured environments. This paper presents a novel framework that bridges natural language understanding and robotic execution by combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with Behavior Trees. This integration enables robots to interpret natural language instructions given by users and translate them into executable actions by activating domain-specific plugins. The system supports scalable and modular integration, with a primary focus on perception-based functionalities, such as person tracking and hand gesture recognition. To evaluate the system, a series of real-world experiments was conducted across diverse environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is practical in real-world scenarios, with an average cognition-to-execution accuracy of approximately 94%, making a significant contribution to HRI systems and robots. The complete source code of the framework is publicly available at https://github.com/snt-arg/robot_suite.

Abstract: GraphQL's flexibility, while beneficial for efficient data fetching, introduces unique security vulnerabilities that traditional API security mechanisms often fail to address. Malicious GraphQL queries can exploit the language's dynamic nature, leading to denial-of-service attacks, data exfiltration through injection, and other exploits. Existing solutions, such as static analysis, rate limiting, and general-purpose Web Application Firewalls, offer limited protection against sophisticated, context-aware attacks. This paper presents a novel, AI-driven approach for real-time detection of malicious GraphQL queries. Our method combines static analysis with machine learning techniques, including Large Language Models (LLMs) for dynamic schema-based configuration, Sentence Transformers (SBERT and Doc2Vec) for contextual embedding of query payloads, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Random Forests, and Multilayer Perceptrons for classification. We detail the system architecture, implementation strategies optimized for production environments (including ONNX Runtime optimization and parallel processing), and evaluate the performance of our detection models and the overall system under load. Results demonstrate high accuracy in detecting various threats, including SQL injection, OS command injection, and XSS exploits, alongside effective mitigation of DoS and SSRF attempts. This research contributes a robust and adaptable solution for enhancing GraphQL API security.

Abstract: Task arithmetic has emerged as a simple yet powerful technique for model merging, enabling the combination of multiple finetuned models into one. Despite its empirical success, a clear theoretical explanation of why and when it works is lacking. This paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for task arithmetic by establishing a connection between task vectors and gradients of the task losses. We show that under standard gradient descent, a task vector generated from one epoch of finetuning is exactly equivalent to the negative gradient of the loss, scaled by the learning rate. For the practical multi-epoch setting, we prove that this equivalence holds approximately, with a second-order error term that we explicitly bound for feed-forward networks. Our empirical analysis across seven vision benchmarks corroborates our theory, demonstrating that the first-epoch gradient dominates the finetuning trajectory in both norm and direction. A key implication is that merging models finetuned for only a single epoch often yields performance comparable to merging fully converged models. These findings reframe task arithmetic as a form of approximate multitask learning, providing a clear rationale for its effectiveness and highlighting the critical role of early training dynamics in model merging.

Abstract: The goal of agents in multi-agent environments is to maximize total reward against the opposing agents that are encountered. Following a game-theoretic solution concept, such as Nash equilibrium, may obtain a strong performance in some settings; however, such approaches fail to capitalize on historical and observed data from repeated interactions against our opponents. Opponent modeling algorithms integrate machine learning techniques to exploit suboptimal opponents utilizing available data; however, the effectiveness of such approaches in imperfect-information games to date is quite limited. We show that existing opponent modeling approaches fail to satisfy a simple desirable property even against static opponents drawn from a known prior distribution; namely, they do not guarantee that the model approaches the opponent's true strategy even in the limit as the number of game iterations approaches infinity. We develop a new algorithm that is able to achieve this property and runs efficiently by solving a convex minimization problem based on the sequence-form game representation using projected gradient descent. The algorithm is guaranteed to efficiently converge to the opponent's true strategy given observations from gameplay and possibly additional historical data if it is available.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Recommender Systems (RecSys) can flexibly adapt recommendation systems to different domains. It utilizes in-context learning (ICL), i.e., the prompts, to customize the recommendation functions, which include sensitive historical user-specific item interactions, e.g., implicit feedback like clicked items or explicit product reviews. Such private information may be exposed to novel privacy attack. However, no study has been done on this important issue. We design four membership inference attacks (MIAs), aiming to reveal whether victims' historical interactions have been used by system prompts. They are \emph{direct inquiry, hallucination, similarity, and poisoning attacks}, each of which utilizes the unique features of LLMs or RecSys. We have carefully evaluated them on three LLMs that have been used to develop ICL-LLM RecSys and two well-known RecSys benchmark datasets. The results confirm that the MIA threat on LLM RecSys is realistic: direct inquiry and poisoning attacks showing significantly high attack advantages. We have also analyzed the factors affecting these attacks, such as the number of shots in system prompts and the position of the victim in the shots.

Abstract: Hallucinations in LLMs--especially in multimodal settings--undermine reliability. We present a rigorous, information-geometric framework in diffusion dynamics that quantifies hallucination in MLLMs: model outputs are embedded spectrally on multimodal graph Laplacians, and gaps to a truth manifold define a semantic-distortion metric. We derive Courant--Fischer bounds on a temperature-dependent hallucination energy and use RKHS eigenmodes to obtain modality-aware, interpretable measures that track evolution over prompts and time. This reframes hallucination as measurable and bounded, providing a principled basis for evaluation and mitigation.

Abstract: This paper presents an overview of a human-centered initiative aimed at strengthening climate resilience along Nova Scotia's Eastern Shore. This region, a collection of rural villages with deep ties to the sea, faces existential threats from climate change that endanger its way of life. Our project moves beyond a purely technical response, weaving together expertise from Computer Science, Industrial Engineering, and Coastal Geography to co-create tools with the community. By integrating generational knowledge of residents, particularly elders, through the Eastern Shore Citizen Science Coastal Monitoring Network, this project aims to collaborate in building a living digital archive. This effort is hosted under Dalhousie University's Transforming Climate Action (TCA) initiative, specifically through its Transformative Adaptations to Social-Ecological Climate Change Trajectories (TranSECT) and TCA Artificial Intelligence (TCA-AI) projects. This work is driven by a collaboration model in which student teams work directly with residents. We present a detailed project timeline and a replicable model for how technology can support traditional communities, enabling them to navigate climate transformation more effectively.

<title>From Injection to Defense: Constructing Edit-Based Fingerprints for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Fingerprinting is critical for maintaining traceability and protecting the intellectual property (IP) of developers, as LLMs deployed in web applications are susceptible to unauthorized redistribution and misuse via fine-tuning or black-box deployment. However, current backdoor-based fingerprinting methods face a fundamental trade-off: fingerprints embedded as garbled text are easily detected and filtered, whereas those crafted as coherent natural language are prone to being triggered unintentionally. To overcome these limitations, we propose RFEdit, a knowledge-editing framework that embeds a rule-based multilingual natural language fingerprint (MNLF) by modifying a sparse subset of model weights. This approach enables efficient and robust fingerprint injection with minimal impact on unrelated knowledge in LLMs. Our RFEdit framework is further safeguarded by Fingerprint Subspace-aware Fine-Tuning (FSFT), which mitigates fingerprint degradation during legitimate fine-tuning by restricting parameter updates to the fingerprint subspace. This approach preserves fingerprint integrity while enhancing downstream task performance of LLMs. These advances establish a comprehensive pipeline from fingerprint injection to defense, achieving high detection effectiveness, robustness against adversarial manipulations, harmlessness to model utility, and persistence under fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RFEdit maintains robustness under quantization and pruning. Additionally, fingerprint effectiveness is generally improved by more than 10\% when combined with FSFT for math and alpaca downstream tasks.

Abstract: Proteins play crucial roles in almost all biological processes. The advancement of deep learning has greatly accelerated the development of protein foundation models, leading to significant successes in protein understanding and design. However, the lack of systematic red-teaming for these models has raised serious concerns about their potential misuse, such as generating proteins with biological safety risks. This paper introduces SafeProtein, the first red-teaming framework designed for protein foundation models to the best of our knowledge. SafeProtein combines multimodal prompt engineering and heuristic beam search to systematically design red-teaming methods and conduct tests on protein foundation models. We also curated SafeProtein-Bench, which includes a manually constructed red-teaming benchmark dataset and a comprehensive evaluation protocol. SafeProtein achieved continuous jailbreaks on state-of-the-art protein foundation models (up to 70% attack success rate for ESM3), revealing potential biological safety risks in current protein foundation models and providing insights for the development of robust security protection technologies for frontier models. The codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/jigang-fan/SafeProtein.

<title>Improving Factuality in LLMs via Inference-Time Knowledge Graph Construction</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with producing factually consistent answers due to limitations in their parametric memory. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigms mitigate this issue by incorporating external knowledge at inference time. However, such methods typically handle knowledge as unstructured text, which reduces retrieval accuracy, hinders compositional reasoning, and amplifies the influence of irrelevant information on the factual consistency of LLM outputs. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework that dynamically constructs and expands knowledge graphs (KGs) during inference, integrating both internal knowledge extracted from LLMs and external knowledge retrieved from external sources. Our method begins by extracting a seed KG from the question via prompting, followed by iterative expansion using the LLM's internal knowledge. The KG is then selectively refined through external retrieval, enhancing factual coverage and correcting inaccuracies. We evaluate our approach on three diverse Factual QA benchmarks, demonstrating consistent gains in factual accuracy over baselines. Our findings reveal that inference-time KG construction is a promising direction for enhancing LLM factuality in a structured, interpretable, and scalable manner.

Abstract: The Bayesian paradigm offers principled tools for sequential decision-making under uncertainty, but its reliance on a probabilistic model for all parameters can hinder the incorporation of complex structural constraints. We introduce a minimalist Bayesian framework that places a prior only on the component of interest, such as the location of the optimum. Nuisance parameters are eliminated via profile likelihood, which naturally handles constraints. As a direct instantiation, we develop a MINimalist Thompson Sampling (MINTS) algorithm. Our framework accommodates structured problems, including continuum-armed Lipschitz bandits and dynamic pricing. It also provides a probabilistic lens on classical convex optimization algorithms such as the center of gravity and ellipsoid methods. We further analyze MINTS for multi-armed bandits and establish near-optimal regret guarantees.

<title>Sustainable LSTM-Based Precoding for RIS-Aided mmWave MIMO Systems with Implicit CSI</title>

arXiv:2509.12658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a sustainable long short-term memory (LSTM)-based precoding framework for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems. Instead of explicit channel state information (CSI) estimation, the framework exploits uplink pilot sequences to implicitly learn channel characteristics, reducing both pilot overhead and inference complexity. Practical hardware constraints are addressed by incorporating the phase-dependent amplitude model of RIS elements, while a multi-label training strategy improves robustness when multiple near-optimal codewords yield comparable performance. Simulations show that the proposed design achieves over 90% of the spectral efficiency of exhaustive search (ES) with only 2.2% of its computation time, cutting energy consumption by nearly two orders of magnitude. The method also demonstrates resilience under distribution mismatch and scalability to larger RIS arrays, making it a practical and energy-efficient solution for sustainable 6G wireless networks.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare imaging has revolutionized diagnostic medicine and clinical decision-making processes. This work presents an intelligent multimodal framework for medical image analysis that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in healthcare diagnostics. The framework integrates Google Gemini 2.5 Flash for automated tumor detection and clinical report generation across multiple imaging modalities including CT, MRI, X-ray, and Ultrasound. The system combines visual feature extraction with natural language processing to enable contextual image interpretation, incorporating coordinate verification mechanisms and probabilistic Gaussian modeling for anomaly distribution. Multi-layered visualization techniques generate detailed medical illustrations, overlay comparisons, and statistical representations to enhance clinical confidence, with location measurement achieving 80 pixels average deviation. Result processing utilizes precise prompt engineering and textual analysis to extract structured clinical information while maintaining interpretability. Experimental evaluations demonstrated high performance in anomaly detection across multiple modalities. The system features a user-friendly Gradio interface for clinical workflow integration and demonstrates zero-shot learning capabilities to reduce dependence on large datasets. This framework represents a significant advancement in automated diagnostic support and radiological workflow efficiency, though clinical validation and multi-center evaluation are necessary prior to widespread adoption.

Abstract: Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) addresses the challenge of detecting and removing landmines from conflict regions. Much of the life-saving operational knowledge produced by HMA agencies is buried in unstructured reports, limiting the transferability of information between agencies. To address this issue, we propose TextMine: the first dataset, evaluation framework and ontology-guided large language model (LLM) pipeline for knowledge extraction in the HMA domain. TextMine structures HMA reports into (subject, relation, object)-triples, thus creating domain-specific knowledge. To ensure real-world relevance, we created the dataset in collaboration with Cambodian Mine Action Center (CMAC). We further introduce a bias-aware evaluation framework that combines human-annotated triples with an LLM-as-Judge protocol to mitigate position bias in reference-free scoring. Our experiments show that ontology-aligned prompts improve extraction accuracy by up to 44.2%, reduce hallucinations by 22.5%, and enhance format adherence by 20.9% compared to baseline models. We publicly release the dataset and code.

Abstract: WARNING: This paper contains examples of offensive materials. To address the proliferation of toxic content on social media, we introduce SMARTER, we introduce SMARTER, a data-efficient two-stage framework for explainable content moderation using Large Language Models (LLMs). In Stage 1, we leverage LLMs' own outputs to generate synthetic explanations for both correct and incorrect labels, enabling alignment via preference optimization with minimal human supervision. In Stage 2, we refine explanation quality through cross-model training, allowing weaker models to align stylistically and semantically with stronger ones. Experiments on three benchmark tasks -- HateXplain, Latent Hate, and Implicit Hate -- demonstrate that SMARTER enables LLMs to achieve up to a 13.5% macro-F1 improvement over standard few-shot baselines while using only a fraction of the full training data. Our framework offers a scalable strategy for low-resource settings by harnessing LLMs' self-improving capabilities for both classification and explanation.

<title>Enhancing Generative Auto-bidding with Offline Reward Evaluation and Policy Search</title>

Abstract: Auto-bidding serves as a critical tool for advertisers to improve their advertising performance. Recent progress has demonstrated that AI-Generated Bidding (AIGB), which learns a conditional generative planner from offline data, achieves superior performance compared to typical offline reinforcement learning (RL)-based auto-bidding methods. However, existing AIGB methods still face a performance bottleneck due to their inherent inability to explore beyond the static offline dataset. To address this, we propose {AIGB-Pearl} (\emph{{P}lanning with {E}valu{A}tor via RL}), a novel method that integrates generative planning and policy optimization. The core of AIGB-Pearl lies in constructing a trajectory evaluator for scoring generation quality and designing a provably sound KL-Lipschitz-constrained score maximization scheme to ensure safe and efficient exploration beyond the offline dataset. A practical algorithm incorporating the synchronous coupling technique is further devised to ensure the model regularity required by the proposed scheme. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world advertising systems demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our approach.

<title>The Sound of Syntax: Finetuning and Comprehensive Evaluation of Language Models for Speech Pathology</title>

arXiv:2509.16765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to the U.S. National Institutes of Health, more than 3.4 million children experience speech disorders that require clinical intervention. The number of speech-language pathologists (SLPs) is roughly 20 times fewer than the number of affected children, highlighting a significant gap in children's care and a pressing need for technological support that improves the productivity of SLPs. State-of-the-art multimodal language models (MLMs) show promise for supporting SLPs, but their use remains underexplored largely due to a limited understanding of their performance in high-stakes clinical settings. To address this gap, we collaborate with domain experts to develop a taxonomy of real-world use cases of MLMs in speech-language pathologies. Building on this taxonomy, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating MLM across five core use cases, each containing 1,000 manually annotated data points. This benchmark includes robustness and sensitivity tests under various settings, including background noise, speaker gender, and accent. Our evaluation of 15 state-of-the-art MLMs reveals that no single model consistently outperforms others across all tasks. Notably, we find systematic disparities, with models performing better on male speakers, and observe that chain-of-thought prompting can degrade performance on classification tasks with large label spaces and narrow decision boundaries. Furthermore, we study fine-tuning MLMs on domain-specific data, achieving improvements of over 10\% compared to base models. These findings highlight both the potential and limitations of current MLMs for speech-language pathology applications, underscoring the need for further research and targeted development.

<title>GRPO is Secretly a Process Reward Model</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove theoretically that the GRPO RL algorithm induces a non-trivial process reward model (PRM), under certain assumptions regarding within-group overlap of token sequences across completions. We then show empirically that these assumptions are met under real-world conditions: GRPO does in fact induce a non-trivial PRM. Leveraging the framework of GRPO-as-a-PRM, we identify a flaw in the GRPO objective: non-uniformly distributed process steps hinder both exploration and exploitation (under different conditions). We propose a simple modification to the algorithm to mitigate this defect ($\lambda$-GRPO), and show that LLMs trained with $\lambda$-GRPO achieve higher validation accuracy and performance on downstream reasoning tasks$-$and reach peak performance more rapidly$-$than LLMs trained with standard GRPO. Our results call into question the advantage of costly, explicitly-defined PRMs for GRPO: we show that it is possible to instead leverage the hidden, built-in PRM structure within the vanilla GRPO algorithm to boost model performance with a negligible impact on training time and cost.

<title>PARL-MT: Learning to Call Functions in Multi-Turn Conversation with Progress Awareness</title>

arXiv:2509.23206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive success in single-turn function calling, yet real-world applications such as travel planning or multi-stage data analysis typically unfold across multi-turn conversations. In these settings, LLMs must not only issue accurate function calls at each step but also maintain progress awareness, the ability to summarize past interactions and plan future actions to ensure coherent, long-horizon task execution. Existing approaches, however, either reduce multi-turn training to isolated single-turn samples, which neglects task-level planning, or employ end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) that struggles with redundancy and lacks explicit integration of progress awareness. To overcome these limitations, we introduce PARL-MT, a framework that explicitly incorporates progress awareness into LLM training for multi-turn function calling. PARL-MT combines (i) a Progress Awareness Generation (PAG) pipeline, which automatically constructs datasets coupling conversation summaries with future task planning, and (ii) a Progress Awareness-Guided Reinforcement Learning (PAG-RL) algorithm, which integrates progress awareness into RL training to reduce contextual redundancy and improve alignment between local actions and global task completion. Empirical results on two public benchmarks demonstrate that PARL-MT significantly outperforms existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of progress awareness in enabling robust and efficient multi-turn function calling.

Abstract: Foundation models have driven remarkable progress in text, vision, and video understanding, and are now poised to unlock similar breakthroughs in trajectory modeling. We introduce the GPSMasked Trajectory Transformer (GPS-MTM), a foundation model for large-scale mobility data that captures patterns of normalcy in human movement. Unlike prior approaches that flatten trajectories into coordinate streams, GPS-MTM decomposes mobility into two complementary modalities: states (point-of-interest categories) and actions (agent transitions). Leveraging a bi-directional Transformer with a self-supervised masked modeling objective, the model reconstructs missing segments across modalities, enabling it to learn rich semantic correlations without manual labels. Across benchmark datasets, including Numosim-LA, Urban Anomalies, and Geolife, GPS-MTM consistently outperforms on downstream tasks such as trajectory infilling and next-stop prediction. Its advantages are most pronounced in dynamic tasks (inverse and forward dynamics), where contextual reasoning is critical. These results establish GPS-MTM as a robust foundation model for trajectory analytics, positioning mobility data as a first-class modality for large-scale representation learning. Code is released for further reference.

arXiv:2509.26281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Driven by the growing need for Oriented Object Detection (OOD), learning from point annotations under a weakly-supervised framework has emerged as a promising alternative to costly and laborious manual labeling. In this paper, we discuss two deficiencies in existing point-supervised methods: inefficient utilization and poor quality of pseudo labels. Therefore, we present Point2RBox-v3. At the core are two principles: 1) Progressive Label Assignment (PLA). It dynamically estimates instance sizes in a coarse yet intelligent manner at different stages of the training process, enabling the use of label assignment methods. 2) Prior-Guided Dynamic Mask Loss (PGDM-Loss). It is an enhancement of the Voronoi Watershed Loss from Point2RBox-v2, which overcomes the shortcomings of Watershed in its poor performance in sparse scenes and SAM's poor performance in dense scenes. To our knowledge, Point2RBox-v3 is the first model to employ dynamic pseudo labels for label assignment, and it creatively complements the advantages of SAM model with the watershed algorithm, which achieves excellent performance in both sparse and dense scenes. Our solution gives competitive performance, especially in scenarios with large variations in object size or sparse object occurrences: 66.09%/56.86%/41.28%/46.40%/19.60%/45.96% on DOTA-v1.0/DOTA-v1.5/DOTA-v2.0/DIOR/STAR/RSAR.

Abstract: The Spiral of Silence (SoS) theory holds that individuals with minority views often refrain from speaking out for fear of social isolation, enabling majority positions to dominate public discourse. When the 'agents' are large language models (LLMs), however, the classical psychological explanation is not directly applicable, since SoS was developed for human societies. This raises a central question: can SoS-like dynamics nevertheless emerge from purely statistical language generation in LLM collectives? We propose an evaluation framework for examining SoS in LLM agents. Specifically, we consider four controlled conditions that systematically vary the availability of 'History' and 'Persona' signals. Opinion dynamics are assessed using trend tests such as Mann-Kendall and Spearman's rank, along with concentration measures including kurtosis and interquartile range. Experiments across open-source and closed-source models show that history and persona together produce strong majority dominance and replicate SoS patterns; history signals alone induce strong anchoring; and persona signals alone foster diverse but uncorrelated opinions, indicating that without historical anchoring, SoS dynamics cannot emerge. The work bridges computational sociology and responsible AI design, highlighting the need to monitor and mitigate emergent conformity in LLM-agent systems.

Summary: 
Transformers excel in natural language processing tasks but face challenges in logical reasoning. The Hierarchical Reasoning Model introduces recurrent reasoning in transformer latent space, showing promising results in 2D reasoning tasks. This model is still in early stages and requires further exploration. This work reviews the Hierarchical Reasoning Model, analyzes design choices, explores alternative variants, and addresses common misconceptions. It sheds light on the potential of leveraging latent space and recurrent reasoning to enhance transformer performance in logical reasoning tasks. More research is needed to fully understand the capabilities and limitations of this approach and to uncover its full potential in advancing logical reasoning capabilities of transformer models. <div>

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable performance in natural language processing and related domains, as they largely focus on sequential, autoregressive next-token prediction tasks. Yet, they struggle in logical reasoning, not necessarily because of a fundamental limitation of these models, but possibly due to the lack of exploration of more creative uses, such as latent space and recurrent reasoning. An emerging exploration in this direction is the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (Wang et. al., 2025), which introduces a novel type of recurrent reasoning in the latent space of transformers, achieving remarkable performance on a wide range of 2D reasoning tasks. Despite the promising results, this line of models is still at an early stage and calls for in-depth investigation. In this work, we review this class of models, examine key design choices, test alternative variants and clarify common misconceptions.

<div> Keywords: OpenAI, abstraction abilities, ConceptARC, reasoning models, multimodal models

Summary: 
The study evaluates the abstraction abilities of AI models, particularly on the ConceptARC benchmark, which aims to test abstract reasoning skills. The research examines different settings, including input modalities (textual vs. visual) and reasoning efforts, to understand how well models capture intended abstractions. While some textual models match human accuracy, their rules often rely on surface-level "shortcuts" rather than true abstraction. In the visual modality, AI models struggle with accuracy but still exhibit some ability to capture intended abstractions in their rules. The findings suggest that models currently lag behind humans in abstract reasoning, and assessing solely based on accuracy may overestimate textual performance and underestimate visual performance. The authors propose that their evaluation framework provides a more accurate assessment of multimodal models' abstract reasoning abilities, offering insights for advancing towards human-like abstraction-centered intelligence. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.02125v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: OpenAI's o3-preview reasoning model exceeded human accuracy on the ARC-AGI benchmark, but does that mean state-of-the-art models recognize and reason with the abstractions that the task creators intended? We investigate models' abstraction abilities on ConceptARC. We evaluate models under settings that vary the input modality (textual vs. visual), whether the model is permitted to use external Python tools, and, for reasoning models, the amount of reasoning effort. In addition to measuring output accuracy, we perform fine-grained evaluation of the natural-language rules that models generate to explain their solutions. This dual evaluation lets us assess whether models solve tasks using the abstractions ConceptARC was designed to elicit, rather than relying on surface-level patterns. Our results show that, while some models using text-based representations match human output accuracy, the best models' rules are often based on surface-level ``shortcuts'' and capture intended abstractions far less often than humans. Thus their capabilities for general abstract reasoning may be overestimated by evaluations based on accuracy alone. In the visual modality, AI models' output accuracy drops sharply, yet our rule-level analysis reveals that models might be underestimated, as they still exhibit a substantial share of rules that capture intended abstractions, but are often unable to correctly apply these rules. In short, our results show that models still lag humans in abstract reasoning, and that using accuracy alone to evaluate abstract reasoning on ARC-like tasks may overestimate abstract-reasoning capabilities in textual modalities and underestimate it in visual modalities. We believe that our evaluation framework offers a more faithful picture of multimodal models' abstract reasoning abilities and a more principled way to track progress toward human-like, abstraction-centered intelligence.

Summary:
SBP-YOLO is a novel detection framework designed for embedded systems to efficiently detect speed bumps and potholes on roads. By integrating GhostConv and VoVGSCSPC modules, the framework enhances multi-scale semantic features while reducing computation.

A hybrid training strategy combining NWD loss, BCKD knowledge distillation, and Albumentations-based augmentation enhances robustness under various road conditions. Experimental results show that SBP-YOLO achieves an mAP of 87.0%, outperforming the YOLOv11n baseline by 5.8%. After TensorRT FP16 quantization, the framework runs at 139.5 FPS on Jetson AGX Xavier, demonstrating its suitability for fast and low-latency road condition perception in embedded suspension control systems. <div>

Abstract: Speed bumps and potholes are the most common road anomalies, significantly affecting ride comfort and vehicle stability. Preview-based suspension control mitigates their impact by detecting such irregularities in advance and adjusting suspension parameters proactively. Accurate and real-time detection is essential, but embedded deployment is constrained by limited computational resources and the small size of targets in input images.To address these challenges, this paper proposes SBP-YOLO, an efficient detection framework for speed bumps and potholes in embedded systems. Built upon YOLOv11n, it integrates GhostConv and VoVGSCSPC modules in the backbone and neck to reduce computation while enhancing multi-scale semantic features. A P2-level branch improves small-object detection, and a lightweight and efficient detection head (LEDH) maintains accuracy with minimal overhead. A hybrid training strategy further enhances robustness under varying road and environmental conditions, combining NWD loss, BCKD knowledge distillation, and Albumentations-based augmentation. Experiments show that SBP-YOLO achieves 87.0% mAP, outperforming the YOLOv11n baseline by 5.8%. After TensorRT FP16 quantization, it runs at 139.5 FPS on Jetson AGX Xavier, yielding a 12.4% speedup over the P2-enhanced YOLOv11. These results demonstrate the framework's suitability for fast, low-latency road condition perception in embedded suspension control systems.

<div> structure-aware, reconstruction, rainfall, radar reflectivity, spatial interpolation 

Summary:<br />
The article introduces RainSeer, a framework for reconstructing high-resolution rainfall fields by reinterpreting radar reflectivity to capture the development of rain. Two fundamental challenges are addressed: translating radar fields into point-wise rainfall observations and bridging the disconnect between aloft hydro-meteors and ground-level precipitation. RainSeer consists of a Structure-to-Point Mapper for spatial alignment and a Geo-Aware Rain Decoder for capturing the transformation of hydro-meteors. Evaluation on two datasets shows consistent improvements over baselines, reducing MAE by 13.31% and enhancing structural fidelity in reconstructed rainfall fields. RainSeer offers a promising approach for flood forecasting, hydrological modeling, and climate analysis. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.02414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing high-resolution rainfall fields is essential for flood forecasting, hydrological modeling, and climate analysis. However, existing spatial interpolation methods-whether based on automatic weather station (AWS) measurements or enhanced with satellite/radar observations often over-smooth critical structures, failing to capture sharp transitions and localized extremes. We introduce RainSeer, a structure-aware reconstruction framework that reinterprets radar reflectivity as a physically grounded structural prior-capturing when, where, and how rain develops. This shift, however, introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) translating high-resolution volumetric radar fields into sparse point-wise rainfall observations, and (ii) bridging the physical disconnect between aloft hydro-meteors and ground-level precipitation. RainSeer addresses these through a physics-informed two-stage architecture: a Structure-to-Point Mapper performs spatial alignment by projecting mesoscale radar structures into localized ground-level rainfall, through a bidirectional mapping, and a Geo-Aware Rain Decoder captures the semantic transformation of hydro-meteors through descent, melting, and evaporation via a causal spatiotemporal attention mechanism. We evaluate RainSeer on two public datasets-RAIN-F (Korea, 2017-2019) and MeteoNet (France, 2016-2018)-and observe consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, reducing MAE by over 13.31% and significantly enhancing structural fidelity in reconstructed rainfall fields.

<div> Generative models for protein backbone design have advanced but face a speed bottleneck in sampling. This study explores score distillation techniques to train faster few-step protein backbone generators without compromising quality. By adapting Score identity Distillation (SiD) and incorporating multistep generation with noise modulation during inference, the distilled models achieve a more than 20-fold improvement in sampling speed compared to the Proteina teacher model.

Abstract: Diffusion- and flow-based generative models have recently demonstrated strong performance in protein backbone generation tasks, offering unprecedented capabilities for de novo protein design. However, while achieving notable performance in generation quality, these models are limited by their generating speed, often requiring hundreds of iterative steps in the reverse-diffusion process. This computational bottleneck limits their practical utility in large-scale protein discovery, where thousands to millions of candidate structures are needed. To address this challenge, we explore the techniques of score distillation, which has shown great success in reducing the number of sampling steps in the vision domain while maintaining high generation quality. However, a straightforward adaptation of these methods results in unacceptably low designability. Through extensive study, we have identified how to appropriately adapt Score identity Distillation (SiD), a state-of-the-art score distillation strategy, to train few-step protein backbone generators which significantly reduce sampling time, while maintaining comparable performance to their pretrained teacher model. In particular, multistep generation combined with inference time noise modulation is key to the success. We demonstrate that our distilled few-step generators achieve more than a 20-fold improvement in sampling speed, while achieving similar levels of designability, diversity, and novelty as the Proteina teacher model. This reduction in inference cost enables large-scale in silico protein design, thereby bringing diffusion-based models closer to real-world protein engineering applications.

<div> Keywords: safety-critical agents, large language models, attention mechanisms, compliance behavior, rule verification

Summary: 
The paper analyzes how rule encodings in system prompts impact attention mechanisms and compliance behavior in safety-critical agents based on large language models (LLMs). It reveals that rule formats with low syntactic entropy and concentrated anchors lead to reduced attention entropy and improved pointer fidelity, highlighting a trade-off between anchor redundancy and attention entropy. Various attention architectures like causal, bidirectional, and cross-attention mechanisms are examined, with bounds established on pointer fidelity. The study emphasizes the importance of principled anchor design and dual enforcement mechanisms to safeguard LLM-based agents from prompt injection attacks while ensuring compliance in evolving domains. Additionally, a dynamic rule verification architecture is proposed, proving that hot reloading of verified rule sets increases the probability of compliant outputs over time.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The design of safety-critical agents based on large language models (LLMs) requires more than simple prompt engineering. This paper presents a comprehensive information-theoretic analysis of how rule encodings in system prompts influence attention mechanisms and compliance behaviour. We demonstrate that rule formats with low syntactic entropy and highly concentrated anchors reduce attention entropy and improve pointer fidelity, but reveal a fundamental trade-off between anchor redundancy and attention entropy that previous work failed to recognize. Through formal analysis of multiple attention architectures including causal, bidirectional, local sparse, kernelized, and cross-attention mechanisms, we establish bounds on pointer fidelity and show how anchor placement strategies must account for competing fidelity and entropy objectives. Combining these insights with a dynamic rule verification architecture, we provide a formal proof that hot reloading of verified rule sets increases the asymptotic probability of compliant outputs. These findings underscore the necessity of principled anchor design and dual enforcement mechanisms to protect LLM-based agents against prompt injection attacks while maintaining compliance in evolving domains.

<div> architecture, natural language understanding, cognitive loop, external memory, goal-directed

Summary:
The Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) proposes a new architecture for large language models to improve coherence and predictability in multi-step tasks. SCL separates inference, memory, and control functions, offloading cognitive load from the model. Evaluations against prompt-based baselines in travel planning, email drafting, and image generation show modest but consistent improvements in task success, goal fidelity, and reliability of intermediate states. External memory and control each contribute independently to the performance enhancements. The results suggest that architectural separation can enhance traceability and reliability without the need for larger models or heavier prompts. Further studies are recommended to explore the potential of SCL in more complex tasks and collaborative settings.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have advanced natural language understanding and generation, yet their use as autonomous agents raises architectural challenges for multi-step tasks. Existing frameworks often intertwine inference, memory, and control in a single prompt, which can reduce coherence and predictability. The Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) is introduced as an alternative architecture that separates these functions. In SCL, the language model is dedicated to inference, memory is maintained externally, and execution is guided by a lightweight controller within a goal-directed loop. This design offloads cognitive load from the model and allows intermediate results to be stored, revisited, and checked before actions are taken, providing a clearer basis for traceability and evaluation.
  We evaluate SCL against prompt-based baselines including ReAct and common LangChain agents across three scenarios: temperature-based travel planning, email drafting with conditional send, and constraint-guided image generation. All systems share the same base model and tools under matched decoding settings. Across 360 episodes, SCL shows modest but consistent improvements. Task success averages 86.3 percent compared with 70-77 percent for baselines. Goal fidelity is higher, redundant calls are fewer, intermediate states are reused more reliably, and unsupported assertions per 100 tool calls are reduced. Ablations show that external memory and control each contribute independently, and decoding sweeps confirm stability of the effects.
  These results suggest that architectural separation can improve reliability and traceability without relying on larger models or heavier prompts. The findings are preliminary and intended to guide extended studies with additional models, longer horizons, multimodal tasks, and collaborative settings.

Summary: 
The article introduces SAC-Opt, a backward-guided correction framework for optimization modeling using Large language models (LLMs). SAC-Opt focuses on aligning semantic anchors and selectively correcting mismatched components in generated code to improve model fidelity and robustness. It addresses the challenge of semantic errors in solver-driven approaches by refining constraint and objective logic based on problem semantics. Empirical results on multiple datasets show that SAC-Opt enhances modeling accuracy by an average of 7.8%, with significant gains on specific datasets like ComplexLP. This approach highlights the importance of semantic-anchored correction in LLM-based optimization workflows to ensure accurate translation of problem intent into solver-executable code. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have opened new paradigms in optimization modeling by enabling the generation of executable solver code from natural language descriptions. Despite this promise, existing approaches typically remain solver-driven: they rely on single-pass forward generation and apply limited post-hoc fixes based on solver error messages, leaving undetected semantic errors that silently produce syntactically correct but logically flawed models. To address this challenge, we propose SAC-Opt, a backward-guided correction framework that grounds optimization modeling in problem semantics rather than solver feedback. At each step, SAC-Opt aligns the original semantic anchors with those reconstructed from the generated code and selectively corrects only the mismatched components, driving convergence toward a semantically faithful model. This anchor-driven correction enables fine-grained refinement of constraint and objective logic, enhancing both fidelity and robustness without requiring additional training or supervision. Empirical results on seven public datasets demonstrate that SAC-Opt improves average modeling accuracy by 7.8\%, with gains of up to 21.9\% on the ComplexLP dataset. These findings highlight the importance of semantic-anchored correction in LLM-based optimization workflows to ensure faithful translation from problem intent to solver-executable code.

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges faced by large language models (LLMs) in processing complex rule systems and introduces a novel framework called Dynamic Adjudication Template (DAT) to address these challenges. DAT structures the inference process into three stages: qualitative analysis, evidence gathering, and adjudication. It allows for more systematic processing of structured rules, leading to improved performance in rule-based tasks. Empirical results show that DAT outperforms conventional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approaches, enabling smaller language models to achieve comparable or better performance than larger LLMs. This highlights the efficiency and effectiveness of DAT in managing intricate rule systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges when processing complex rule systems, as they typically treat interdependent rules as unstructured textual data rather than as logically organized frameworks. This limitation results in reasoning divergence, where models often overlook critical rule dependencies essential for accurate interpretation. Although existing approaches such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning have shown promise, they lack systematic methodologies for structured rule processing and are particularly susceptible to error propagation through sequential reasoning chains. To address these limitations, we propose the Dynamic Adjudication Template (DAT), a novel framework inspired by expert human reasoning processes. DAT structures the inference mechanism into three methodical stages: qualitative analysis, evidence gathering, and adjudication. During the qualitative analysis phase, the model comprehensively evaluates the contextual landscape. The subsequent evidence gathering phase involves the targeted extraction of pertinent information based on predefined template elements ([placeholder]), followed by systematic verification against applicable rules. Finally, in the adjudication phase, the model synthesizes these validated components to formulate a comprehensive judgment. Empirical results demonstrate that DAT consistently outperforms conventional CoT approaches in complex rule-based tasks. Notably, DAT enables smaller language models to match, and in some cases exceed, the performance of significantly larger LLMs, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness in managing intricate rule systems.

<div> Symbol Grounding Problem, Algorithmic Information Theory, information compression, G\"odelian perspective, No Free Lunch perspective <br />
Summary: <br />
This paper presents a comprehensive framework for the Symbol Grounding Problem (SGP) within Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT). It establishes that the grounding of meaning is constrained by information-theoretic limits, bridging the G\"odelian and No Free Lunch perspectives. The model defines a symbolic system as a universal Turing machine and grounds meaning as information compression. The argument progresses through four stages: showing that symbolic systems cannot ground most possible worlds due to their randomness, demonstrating the incompleteness of statically grounded systems, proving the non-inferability of the grounding act, and using Chaitin's Incompleteness Theorem to show that algorithmic learning processes cannot model worlds more complex than themselves. This confirms that meaning is an ongoing process of a system trying to surpass its information-theoretic boundaries. <div>
arXiv:2510.05153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a definitive, unifying framework for the Symbol Grounding Problem (SGP) by reformulating it within Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT). We demonstrate that the grounding of meaning is a process fundamentally constrained by information-theoretic limits, thereby unifying the G\"odelian (self-reference) and No Free Lunch (statistical) perspectives. We model a symbolic system as a universal Turing machine and define grounding as an act of information compression. The argument proceeds in four stages. First, we prove that a purely symbolic system cannot ground almost all possible "worlds" (data strings), as they are algorithmically random and thus incompressible. Second, we show that any statically grounded system, specialized for compressing a specific world, is inherently incomplete because an adversarial, incompressible world relative to the system can always be constructed. Third, the "grounding act" of adapting to a new world is proven to be non-inferable, as it requires the input of new information (a shorter program) that cannot be deduced from the system's existing code. Finally, we use Chaitin's Incompleteness Theorem to prove that any algorithmic learning process is itself a finite system that cannot comprehend or model worlds whose complexity provably exceeds its own. This establishes that meaning is the open-ended process of a system perpetually attempting to overcome its own information-theoretic limitations.

Summary: 
Lang-PINN is introduced as a multi-agent system driven by large language models to automatically construct physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) from natural language descriptions of tasks. It coordinates four agents to parse task descriptions into PDEs, select architectures, generate code, and provide feedback for refinement. Experiments show that Lang-PINN outperforms competitive baselines, reducing mean squared error by up to 3-5 orders of magnitude, improving end-to-end execution success by more than 50%, and reducing time overhead by up to 74%. This innovative approach transforms informal task statements into executable and verifiable PINN code, offering a more efficient and accurate solution for solving PDEs using neural networks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) provide a powerful approach for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), but constructing a usable PINN remains labor-intensive and error-prone. Scientists must interpret problems as PDE formulations, design architectures and loss functions, and implement stable training pipelines. Existing large language model (LLM) based approaches address isolated steps such as code generation or architecture suggestion, but typically assume a formal PDE is already specified and therefore lack an end-to-end perspective. We present Lang-PINN, an LLM-driven multi-agent system that builds trainable PINNs directly from natural language task descriptions. Lang-PINN coordinates four complementary agents: a PDE Agent that parses task descriptions into symbolic PDEs, a PINN Agent that selects architectures, a Code Agent that generates modular implementations, and a Feedback Agent that executes and diagnoses errors for iterative refinement. This design transforms informal task statements into executable and verifiable PINN code. Experiments show that Lang-PINN achieves substantially lower errors and greater robustness than competitive baselines: mean squared error (MSE) is reduced by up to 3--5 orders of magnitude, end-to-end execution success improves by more than 50\%, and reduces time overhead by up to 74\%.

Summary:
Foundation models, such as those used in vision, language, speech, multimodality, and neuroscience research, have shown high transferability and alignment potential in capturing task-specific information within a single modality. These models exhibit structural regularities and semantic consistencies in their representation spaces, making them suitable for cross-modal transfer and alignment. Key metrics for measuring alignment in foundation models have been identified, and empirical evidence supports their representation potentials. Factors that enhance representation potentials include large-scale pretraining on diverse data and similarity across architectures and modalities. However, several open questions remain, and challenges in leveraging representation potentials for practical applications need to be addressed.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models learn highly transferable representations through large-scale pretraining on diverse data. An increasing body of research indicates that these representations exhibit a remarkable degree of similarity across architectures and modalities. In this survey, we investigate the representation potentials of foundation models, defined as the latent capacity of their learned representations to capture task-specific information within a single modality while also providing a transferable basis for alignment and unification across modalities. We begin by reviewing representative foundation models and the key metrics that make alignment measurable. We then synthesize empirical evidence of representation potentials from studies in vision, language, speech, multimodality, and neuroscience. The evidence suggests that foundation models often exhibit structural regularities and semantic consistencies in their representation spaces, positioning them as strong candidates for cross-modal transfer and alignment. We further analyze the key factors that foster representation potentials, discuss open questions, and highlight potential challenges.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized various applications including agriculture, but it still faces challenges in data collection and understanding. This paper proposes a real-time framework with three additional semantic layers to help IoT devices and sensors comprehend data meaning and source. The framework consists of six layers: perception, semantic annotation, interoperability, transportation, semantic reasoning, and application, suitable for dynamic environments. Sensors collect data in the form of voltage, which is then processed by microprocessors or microcontrollers in the semantic annotation and preprocessing layer. Metadata is added to the raw data, including the purpose, ID number, and application. Two semantic algorithms are proposed in the semantic interoperability and ontologies layer: the interoperability semantic algorithm for standardizing file types and the synonym identification algorithm for identifying synonyms. In the transportation layer, raw data and metadata are sent to other IoT devices or cloud computing platforms using techniques like WiFi, Zigbee networks, Bluetooth, and mobile communication networks. A semantic reasoning layer is proposed to infer new knowledge from the existing data, using fuzzy logic, Dempster-Shafer theory, and Bayesian networks. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) is proposed in the application layer to help users communicate with and monitor IoT sensors, devices, and new knowledge inferred. This framework provides a robust solution for managing IoT data, ensuring semantic completeness, and enabling real-time knowledge inference. The integration of uncertainty reasoning methods and semantic interoperability techniques makes this framework a valuable tool for advancing IoT applications in general and in agriculture in particular.

The article introduces Dramaturge, an approach to improving long narrative scripts generated by Language Model Models (LLMs) by addressing global structural issues and local detailed flaws. Dramaturge is powered by hierarchical multiple LLM agents and consists of three stages: Global Review to understand the overall storyline, Scene-level Review to pinpoint detailed flaws, and Hierarchical Coordinated Revision to integrate improvements. The top-down task flow ensures contextual consistency, and a coarse-to-fine iterative process is followed through multiple rounds of revision.

arXiv:2510.05188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although LLMs have been widely adopted for creative content generation, a single-pass process often struggles to produce high-quality long narratives. How to effectively revise and improve long narrative scripts like scriptwriters remains a significant challenge, as it demands a comprehensive understanding of the entire context to identify global structural issues and local detailed flaws, as well as coordinating revisions at multiple granularities and locations. Direct modifications by LLMs typically introduce inconsistencies between local edits and the overall narrative requirements. To address these issues, we propose Dramaturge, a task and feature oriented divide-and-conquer approach powered by hierarchical multiple LLM agents. It consists of a Global Review stage to grasp the overall storyline and structural issues, a Scene-level Review stage to pinpoint detailed scene and sentence flaws, and a Hierarchical Coordinated Revision stage that coordinates and integrates structural and detailed improvements throughout the script. The top-down task flow ensures that high-level strategies guide local modifications, maintaining contextual consistency. The review and revision workflow follows a coarse-to-fine iterative process, continuing through multiple rounds until no further substantive improvements can be made. Comprehensive experiments show that Dramaturge significantly outperforms all baselines in terms of script-level overall quality and scene-level details. Our approach is plug-and-play and can be easily integrated into existing methods to improve the generated scripts.

Population-level data analysis is crucial for effective decision-making during public health emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic. Conventional methods struggle with the massive input of semi-structured data. To address this, a novel graph-based reasoning framework is proposed, integrating large language models with structured demographic attributes and unstructured public feedback in a weakly supervised pipeline. This approach dynamically models evolving citizen needs into a need-aware graph, allowing for population-specific analyses based on key features. The method aims to provide interpretable insights to inform responsive health policy decision-making. Preliminary experimental results using real-world data show the feasibility of this approach, offering a scalable solution for intelligent population health monitoring in resource-constrained clinical and governmental settings.

Abstract: Timely and accurate analysis of population-level data is crucial for effective decision-making during public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the massive input of semi-structured data, including structured demographic information and unstructured human feedback, poses significant challenges to conventional analysis methods. Manual expert-driven assessments, though accurate, are inefficient, while standard NLP pipelines often require large task-specific labeled datasets and struggle with generalization across diverse domains. To address these challenges, we propose a novel graph-based reasoning framework that integrates large language models with structured demographic attributes and unstructured public feedback in a weakly supervised pipeline. The proposed approach dynamically models evolving citizen needs into a need-aware graph, enabling population-specific analyses based on key features such as age, gender, and the Index of Multiple Deprivation. It generates interpretable insights to inform responsive health policy decision-making. We test our method using a real-world dataset, and preliminary experimental results demonstrate its feasibility. This approach offers a scalable solution for intelligent population health monitoring in resource-constrained clinical and governmental settings.

<div> Keywords: AI systems, repeated sampling, capabilities, risks, prediction

Summary:
In the research on frontier AI systems, it is crucial to assess their capabilities and risks accurately. Repeated sampling from these models has been shown to enhance both their abilities and potential risks. However, predicting a model's behavior accurately when scaled to a large number of attempts with a limited sampling budget poses a challenge. Standard methods for fitting these laws have statistical shortcomings that hinder predictive accuracy, especially in scenarios with limited data. To address this issue, a robust estimation framework using a beta-binomial distribution is introduced to improve predictions from limited data. Additionally, a dynamic sampling strategy is proposed to allocate a greater budget to more challenging problems. These innovations enable more reliable prediction of rare risks and capabilities at a reduced computational cost. <div>

Abstract: Assessing the capabilities and risks of frontier AI systems is a critical area of research, and recent work has shown that repeated sampling from models can dramatically increase both. For instance, repeated sampling has been shown to increase their capabilities, such as solving difficult math and coding problems, but it has also been shown to increase their potential for harm, such as being jailbroken. Such results raise a crucial question for both capability and safety forecasting: how can one accurately predict a model's behavior when scaled to a massive number of attempts, given a vastly smaller sampling budget? This question is directly relevant to model providers, who serve hundreds of millions of users daily, and to governmental regulators, who seek to prevent harms. To answer this questions, we make three contributions. First, we find that standard methods for fitting these laws suffer from statistical shortcomings that hinder predictive accuracy, especially in data-limited scenarios. Second, we remedy these shortcomings by introducing a robust estimation framework, which uses a beta-binomial distribution to generate more accurate predictions from limited data. Third, we propose a dynamic sampling strategy that allocates a greater budget to harder problems. Combined, these innovations enable more reliable prediction of rare risks and capabilities at a fraction of the computational cost.

Summary:
This study introduces a hybrid reward modeling framework for aligning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with human preferences. The framework combines model-based rewards, where a learned reward model predicts scores from synthetic and human feedback, with rule-based rewards based on domain-specific heuristics. Multi-aspect rewards are incorporated to enforce instruction adherence, and a length-penalty reward helps stabilize training. Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across different multimodal benchmarks, with the best model in the 3B family achieving an average overall improvement of ~9.5% in general and math reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Aligning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with human preferences often relies on single-signal, model-based reward methods. Such monolithic rewards often lack confidence calibration across domain-specific tasks, fail to capture diverse aspects of human preferences, and require extensive data annotation and reward model training. In this work, we propose a hybrid reward modeling framework that integrates complementary reward paradigms: (i) model-based rewards, where a learned reward model predicts scalar or vector scores from synthetic and human feedback, and (ii) rule-based rewards, where domain-specific heuristics provide explicit correctness signals with confidence. Beyond accuracy, we further incorporate multi-aspect rewards to enforce instruction adherence and introduce a generalized length-penalty reward to stabilize training and improve performance. The proposed framework provides a flexible and effective approach to aligning MLLMs through reinforcement learning policy optimization. Our experiments show consistent improvements across different multimodal benchmarks when applying hybrid and multi-aspect reward modeling. Our best performing model in the 3B family achieves an overall average improvement of ~9.5% across general and math reasoning tasks. Focusing specifically on mathematical benchmarks, the model achieves a significant average improvement of ~16%, highlighting its effectiveness in mathematical reasoning and problem solving.

Summary:
BIRD-INTERACT is a new benchmark designed to assess large language models' performance in handling multi-turn interactions for text-to-SQL tasks in database applications. It features a realistic interaction environment with databases, knowledge bases, and user simulators, along with two evaluation settings and a challenging task suite covering CRUD operations.

Analysis using memory grafting and Interaction Test-time Scaling shows the importance of effective interaction for complex text-to-SQL tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on single-turn text-to-SQL tasks, but real-world database applications predominantly require multi-turn interactions to handle ambiguous queries, execution errors, and evolving user requirements. Existing multi-turn benchmarks fall short by treating conversation histories as static context or limiting evaluation to read-only operations, failing to reflect production-grade database assistant challenges. We introduce BIRD-INTERACT, a benchmark that restores this realism through: (1) a comprehensive interaction environment coupling each database with a hierarchical knowledge base, metadata files, and a function-driven user simulator, enabling models to solicit clarifications, retrieve knowledge, and recover from errors without human supervision; (2) two evaluation settings consisting of a pre-defined conversational protocol (c-Interact) and an open-ended agentic setting (a-Interact) where models autonomously decide when to query the user simulator or explore the environment; (3) a challenging task suite covering the full CRUD spectrum for business-intelligence and operational use cases, guarded by executable test cases. Each task features ambiguous and follow-up sub-tasks requiring dynamic interaction. The suite comprises BIRD-INTERACT-FULL (600 tasks, up to 11,796 interactions) for comprehensive performance assessment, and BIRD-INTERACT-LITE (300 tasks with simplified databases) for detailed behavioral analysis and rapid method development. Our empirical results highlight BIRD-INTERACT's difficulty: GPT-5 completes only 8.67% of tasks in c-Interact and 17.00% in a-Interact. Analysis via memory grafting and Interaction Test-time Scaling validates the importance of effective interaction for complex, dynamic text-to-SQL tasks.

Summary: 
This review evaluates the use of Bayesian techniques in model predictive control (MPC), specifically focusing on neural network-based modeling, control design, and uncertainty quantification. While Bayesian methods are being increasingly utilized to address uncertainty in MPC, there is a lack of standardized benchmarks and transparent reporting in the studies reviewed. The reported improvements in performance and robustness using Bayesian approaches in MPC are inconclusive due to inconsistent baselines and limited reliability analyses. The review highlights the need for standardized benchmarks, ablation studies, and transparent reporting to accurately assess the effectiveness of Bayesian techniques in MPC. <div>

Abstract: In this review, we assess the use of Bayesian methods in model predictive control (MPC), focusing on neural-network-based modeling, control design, and uncertainty quantification. We systematically analyze individual studies and how they are implemented in practice. While Bayesian approaches are increasingly adopted to capture and propagate uncertainty in MPC, reported gains in performance and robustness remain fragmented, with inconsistent baselines and limited reliability analyses. We therefore argue for standardized benchmarks, ablation studies, and transparent reporting to rigorously determine the effectiveness of Bayesian techniques for MPC.

Summary:
The study addresses the challenge of adapting Foundation Models to new domains with limited training data. It explores the effectiveness of using domain-specific exemplars as in-context demonstrations and considers representing exemplars as soft prompts. The Multi-Head Attention Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MHA-RAG) framework is introduced, leveraging a model architecture that is order invariant to exemplars. Through experiments on various question-answering benchmarks and model scales, MHA-RAG outperforms standard RAG with a 20-point increase in performance while reducing inference costs by a factor of 10X GFLOPs. This framework offers higher accuracy, greater efficiency, and stability, regardless of exemplar order. <div>

Abstract: Adapting Foundation Models to new domains with limited training data is challenging and computationally expensive. While prior work has demonstrated the effectiveness of using domain-specific exemplars as in-context demonstrations, we investigate whether representing exemplars purely as text is the most efficient, effective, and stable approach. We explore an alternative: representing exemplars as soft prompts with an exemplar order invariant model architecture. To this end, we introduce Multi-Head Attention Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MHA-RAG), a framework with the number of attention heads serving as a simple hyperparameter to control soft prompt-generation across different tasks. Across multiple question-answering benchmarks and model scales, MHA-RAG achieves a 20-point performance gain over standard RAG, while cutting inference costs by a factor of 10X GFLOPs-delivering both higher accuracy and greater efficiency, invariant to exemplar order.

<div> Keywords: human-AI collaboration, symbols, meanings, symbolic interactionism theory, shared understanding

Summary:
In a study exploring human-AI collaboration in interpreting symbols and constructing meanings, researchers found that while humans interpret symbols through social interaction, AI systems treat them as patterns with compressed meanings. Results showed that when AI introduced conflicting meanings and symbols in social contexts, 63% of participants reshaped their definitions. This indicates that conflicts in symbols prompt reflection and redefinition, leading to a better shared understanding between humans and AI. The study highlights that shared understanding does not necessarily arise from agreement but from the reciprocal exchange and reinterpretation of symbols. This suggests the need for new paradigms in human-AI interaction design that prioritize the dynamic and collaborative nature of symbol interpretation for more meaningful collaboration.

Abstract: Meaningful human-AI collaboration requires more than processing language, it demands a better understanding of symbols and their constructed meanings. While humans naturally interpret symbols through social interaction, AI systems treat them as patterns with compressed meanings, missing the dynamic meanings that emerge through conversation. Drawing on symbolic interactionism theory, we conducted two studies (N=37) investigated how humans and AI interact with symbols and co-construct their meanings. When AI introduced conflicting meanings and symbols in social contexts, 63% of participants reshaped their definitions. This suggests that conflicts in symbols and meanings prompt reflection and redefinition, allowing both participants and AI to have a better shared understanding of meanings and symbols. This work reveals that shared understanding emerges not from agreement but from the reciprocal exchange and reinterpretation of symbols, suggesting new paradigms for human-AI interaction design.

Summary:  
- Predicting steel hardness after heat treatment is complex due to the many-to-one nature of the process.  
- Estimating input parameters from desired hardness is challenging.  
- Proposed solution uses a Teacher-Student framework with a forward model (Teacher) and backward model (Student).  
- Teacher predicts hardness from input features, while Student infers input configurations from a target hardness.  
- Student optimized using feedback from Teacher in an iterative, supervised loop.  
- Evaluation on tempered steel dataset shows higher accuracy and efficiency compared to baseline models.  
- Teacher-Student framework is effective for inverse process modeling in materials science.  

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the final hardness of steel after heat treatment is a challenging regression task due to the many-to-one nature of the process -- different combinations of input parameters (such as temperature, duration, and chemical composition) can result in the same hardness value. This ambiguity makes the inverse problem, estimating input parameters from a desired hardness, particularly difficult. In this work, we propose a novel solution using a Teacher-Student learning framework. First, a forward model (Teacher) is trained to predict final hardness from 13 metallurgical input features. Then, a backward model (Student) is trained to infer plausible input configurations from a target hardness value. The Student is optimized by leveraging feedback from the Teacher in an iterative, supervised loop. We evaluate our method on a publicly available tempered steel dataset and compare it against baseline regression and reinforcement learning models. Results show that our Teacher-Student framework not only achieves higher inverse prediction accuracy but also requires significantly less computational time, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency for inverse process modeling in materials science.

Summary:
- AInstein is a framework that tests the problem-solving abilities of large language models (LLMs) using only their pre-trained knowledge.
- The framework evaluates LLMs on ICLR papers based on success rate, rediscovery, and novelty.
- LLMs can rediscover feasible solutions and occasionally propose original approaches, but their problem-solving ability is sensitive to framing.
- The study highlights the potential and limitations of LLMs as autonomous scientific problem-solvers.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet it remains unclear whether such success reflects genuine reasoning or sophisticated recall. We introduce AInstein, a framework for testing whether LLMs can generate valid solutions to AI research problems using only their pretrained parametric knowledge -- without domain-specific fine-tuning, retrieval augmentation, or other external aids. Our approach extracts distilled problem statements from high-quality ICLR 2025 submissions, then tasks specialized solver agents with proposing and refining technical solutions through iterative critique loops, mimicking the cycles of proposal, review, and revision central to scientific inquiry. We evaluate AInstein on 1,214 ICLR papers stratified by acceptance tier (Oral, Spotlight, Poster), using an LLM-as-a-judge paradigm guided by a structured rubric, complemented by targeted manual checks. Performance is assessed with three metrics: Success Rate (does the solution address the problem?), Rediscovery (does it align with human-proposed methods?), and Novelty (does it yield valid, original approaches?). Our results reveal that while LLMs can rediscover feasible solutions and occasionally propose creative alternatives, their problem-solving ability remains fragile and highly sensitive to framing. These findings provide the first large-scale evidence on the extent to which LLMs can act as autonomous scientific problem-solvers, highlighting both their latent potential and their current limitations.

Summary:
This paper introduces a hybrid neuro-symbolic framework that combines Answer Set Programming (ASP) with transformer-based learning for multi-label text classification on the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) corpus. The framework uses weighted ASP rules to formalize domain knowledge, which is validated using the Clingo solver. These rules are integrated into the model as rule-based data augmentation and fuzzy-logic regularizers to ensure logical consistency in the predictions. The approach improves micro- and macro-F1 scores, reduces rule violations by up to 86% on the ASRS test set, and enhances label diversity and coverage. This novel approach offers a scalable and interpretable solution for safety-critical NLP tasks by combining symbolic reasoning with deep neural architectures. <div>

Abstract: Deep transformer models excel at multi-label text classification but often violate domain logic that experts consider essential, an issue of particular concern in safety-critical applications. We propose a hybrid neuro-symbolic framework that integrates Answer Set Programming (ASP) with transformer-based learning on the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) corpus. Domain knowledge is formalized as weighted ASP rules and validated using the Clingo solver. These rules are incorporated in two complementary ways: (i) as rule-based data augmentation, generating logically consistent synthetic samples that improve label diversity and coverage; and (ii) as a fuzzy-logic regularizer, enforcing rule satisfaction in a differentiable form during fine-tuning. This design preserves the interpretability of symbolic reasoning while leveraging the scalability of deep neural architectures. We further tune per-class thresholds and report both standard classification metrics and logic-consistency rates. Compared to a strong Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) baseline, our approach improves micro- and macro-F1 scores and achieves up to an 86% reduction in rule violations on the ASRS test set. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first large-scale neuro-symbolic application to ASRS reports that unifies ASP-based reasoning, rule-driven augmentation, and differentiable transformer training for trustworthy, safety-critical NLP.

Summary:  
- The study examines the Dunning-Kruger Effect (DKE) in state-of-the-art LLMs used for coding tasks.  
- Model confidence and performance were analyzed across different programming languages, showing that AI models exhibit human-like patterns of overconfidence, especially in unfamiliar or low-resource domains.  
- Less competent models and those working with rare programming languages display stronger DKE-like bias, indicating that the bias intensity correlates with model competence.  
- The findings suggest that AI systems can replicate cognitive biases observed in humans, raising concerns about shared agency in collaborative human-AI endeavors.  
- The study highlights the importance of understanding the cognitive boundaries and biases that shape interactions between humans and AI systems in creative and technical domains.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems increasingly collaborate with humans in creative and technical domains, questions arise about the cognitive boundaries and biases that shape our shared agency. This paper investigates the Dunning-Kruger Effect (DKE), the tendency for those with limited competence to overestimate their abilities in state-of-the-art LLMs in coding tasks. By analyzing model confidence and performance across a diverse set of programming languages, we reveal that AI models mirror human patterns of overconfidence, especially in unfamiliar or low-resource domains. Our experiments demonstrate that less competent models and those operating in rare programming languages exhibit stronger DKE-like bias, suggesting that the strength of the bias is proportionate to the competence of the models.

The benchmark consists of 115K pairs from Wikipedia's controversial sections and measures alignment using an LLM-as-judge to score agreement or divergence between responses.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for tasks where outputs shape human decisions, so it is critical to test whether their responses reflect consistent human values. Existing benchmarks mostly track refusals or predefined safety violations, but these only check rule compliance and do not reveal whether a model upholds a coherent value system when facing controversial real-world issues. We introduce the \textbf{V}alue \textbf{AL}ignment \textbf{Bench}mark (\textbf{VAL-Bench}), which evaluates whether models maintain a stable value stance across paired prompts that frame opposing sides of public debates. VAL-Bench consists of 115K such pairs from Wikipedia's controversial sections. A well-aligned model should express similar underlying views regardless of framing, which we measure using an LLM-as-judge to score agreement or divergence between paired responses. Applied across leading open- and closed-source models, the benchmark reveals large variation in alignment and highlights trade-offs between safety strategies (e.g., refusals) and more expressive value systems. By providing a scalable, reproducible benchmark, VAL-Bench enables systematic comparison of how reliably LLMs embody human values.

<div> Automatic Vulnerability Repair, Large Language Models, Vulnerability-related reasoning data, Reinforcement learning, Model training  
Summary:  
The urgent need for automatic vulnerability repair solutions in the face of the exponential increase in software vulnerabilities has led to recent research leveraging large language models for this task. However, challenges persist in capturing diverse vulnerability repair patterns due to the lack of high-quality vulnerability-related reasoning data. Additionally, verifying the intermediate vulnerability repair process during model training is difficult as the process lacks verifiable feedback, unlike other reinforcement learning methods. Current approaches prompt or fine-tune LLMs to generate vulnerability repairs directly, but without vulnerability-related reasoning data, they struggle to capture all repair patterns efficiently. The reliance on general programming knowledge from foundation models also contributes to this limitation. Furthermore, the lack of intermediate, verifiable feedback during model training poses additional challenges to reinforcement learning techniques employed in vulnerability repair processes. Overall, addressing these challenges is crucial for improving the performance and effectiveness of automatic vulnerability repair solutions.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential increase in software vulnerabilities has created an urgent need for automatic vulnerability repair (AVR) solutions. Recent research has formulated AVR as a sequence generation problem and has leveraged large language models (LLMs) to address this problem. Typically, these approaches prompt or fine-tune LLMs to generate repairs for vulnerabilities directly. Although these methods show state-of-the-art performance, they face the following challenges: (1) Lack of high-quality, vulnerability-related reasoning data. Current approaches primarily rely on foundation models that mainly encode general programming knowledge. Without vulnerability-related reasoning data, they tend to fail to capture the diverse vulnerability repair patterns. (2) Hard to verify the intermediate vulnerability repair process during LLM training. Existing reinforcement learning methods often leverage intermediate execution feedback from the environment (e.g., sandbox-based execution results) to guide reinforcement learning training. In contrast, the vulnerability repair process generally lacks such intermediate, verifiable feedback, which poses additional challenges for model training.

Abstract: Taiwan's high population and heavy dependence on fossil fuels have led to severe air pollution, with the most prevalent greenhouse gas being carbon dioxide (CO2). There-fore, this study presents a reproducible and comprehensive case study comparing 21 of the most commonly employed time series models in forecasting emissions, analyzing both univariate and multivariate approaches. Among these, Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest Regressor (RFR) achieved the best performances. To further enhance robustness, the top performers were integrated with Linear Regression through a custom stacked generalization en-semble technique. Our proposed ensemble model achieved an SMAPE of 1.407 with no signs of overfitting. Finally, this research provides an accurate decade-long emission projection that will assist policymakers in making more data-driven decisions.

arXiv:2510.05580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show promise in embodied reasoning, yet remain far from true generalists-they often require task-specific fine-tuning, and generalize poorly to unseen tasks. We propose MetaVLA, a unified, backbone-agnostic post-training framework for efficient and scalable alignment. MetaVLA introduces Context-Aware Meta Co-Training, which consolidates diverse target tasks into a single fine-tuning stage while leveraging structurally diverse auxiliary tasks to improve in-domain generalization. Unlike naive multi-task SFT, MetaVLA integrates a lightweight meta-learning mechanism-derived from Attentive Neural Processes-to enable rapid adaptation from diverse contexts with minimal architectural change or inference overhead. On the LIBERO benchmark, MetaVLA with six auxiliary tasks outperforms OpenVLA by up to 8.0% on long-horizon tasks, reduces training steps from 240K to 75K, and cuts GPU time by ~76%. These results show that scalable, low-resource post-training is achievable-paving the way toward general-purpose embodied agents. Code will be available.

Summary:
AgentFlow is introduced as a trainable framework for outcome-driven reinforcement learning in large language models. It employs specialized modules (planner, executor, verifier, generator) and optimizes its planner within a multi-turn loop. The Flow-based Group Refined Policy Optimization (Flow-GRPO) is proposed for on-policy training in live environments, facilitating long-horizon and sparse-reward credit assignment. Through in-the-flow optimization, AgentFlow outperforms baselines and even proprietary models like GPT-4o on various benchmarks. The framework demonstrates improved planning, enhanced tool-calling reliability, and scalability with model size and reasoning turns. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.05592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Outcome-driven reinforcement learning has advanced reasoning in large language models (LLMs), but prevailing tool-augmented approaches train a single, monolithic policy that interleaves thoughts and tool calls under full context; this scales poorly with long horizons and diverse tools and generalizes weakly to new scenarios. Agentic systems offer a promising alternative by decomposing work across specialized modules, yet most remain training-free or rely on offline training decoupled from the live dynamics of multi-turn interaction. We introduce AgentFlow, a trainable, in-the-flow agentic framework that coordinates four modules (planner, executor, verifier, generator) through an evolving memory and directly optimizes its planner inside the multi-turn loop. To train on-policy in live environments, we propose Flow-based Group Refined Policy Optimization (Flow-GRPO), which tackles long-horizon, sparse-reward credit assignment by converting multi-turn optimization into a sequence of tractable single-turn policy updates. It broadcasts a single, verifiable trajectory-level outcome to every turn to align local planner decisions with global success and stabilizes learning with group-normalized advantages. Across ten benchmarks, AgentFlow with a 7B-scale backbone outperforms top-performing baselines with average accuracy gains of 14.9% on search, 14.0% on agentic, 14.5% on mathematical, and 4.1% on scientific tasks, even surpassing larger proprietary models like GPT-4o. Further analyses confirm the benefits of in-the-flow optimization, showing improved planning, enhanced tool-calling reliability, and positive scaling with model size and reasoning turns.

<br />
Summary: 
This paper introduces the concept of self-evolving agentic artificial intelligence (AI) in the context of wireless systems. The self-evolving agents are capable of continual adaptation and improvement without human intervention, through an autonomous evolution cycle. The paper discusses the layered architecture, life cycle, and key techniques of self-evolving agentic AI, including tool intelligence, workflow optimization, self-reflection, and evolutionary learning. A multi-agent cooperative framework is proposed, where large language models (LLMs) collaborate under a supervisor agent to autonomously execute tasks. A case study on antenna evolution in low-altitude wireless networks demonstrates the framework's ability to autonomously upgrade fixed antenna optimization. Experimental results show significant performance improvements with little to no human intervention, highlighting the adaptability and robustness of self-evolving agentic AI for next-generation wireless intelligence. <div>

Abstract: Self-evolving agentic artificial intelligence (AI) offers a new paradigm for future wireless systems by enabling autonomous agents to continually adapt and improve without human intervention. Unlike static AI models, self-evolving agents embed an autonomous evolution cycle that updates models, tools, and workflows in response to environmental dynamics. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of self-evolving agentic AI, highlighting its layered architecture, life cycle, and key techniques, including tool intelligence, workflow optimization, self-reflection, and evolutionary learning. We further propose a multi-agent cooperative self-evolving agentic AI framework, where multiple large language models (LLMs) are assigned role-specialized prompts under the coordination of a supervisor agent. Through structured dialogue, iterative feedback, and systematic validation, the system autonomously executes the entire life cycle without human intervention. A case study on antenna evolution in low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) demonstrates how the framework autonomously upgrades fixed antenna optimization into movable antenna optimization. Experimental results show that the proposed self-evolving agentic AI autonomously improves beam gain and restores degraded performance by up to 52.02%, consistently surpassing the fixed baseline with little to no human intervention and validating its adaptability and robustness for next-generation wireless intelligence.

<div> Keywords: GPT-4o, radiology reports, multi-label classification, label extraction, uncertainty detection<br />
Summary:<br />
- The study evaluated GPT-4o's ability to extract diagnostic labels from radiology reports, achieving a high label extraction accuracy rate of 98.6% in test sets.
- Labels extracted were used for multi-label classification of musculoskeletal radiographs, with competitive performance indicated by macro-averaged AUC values for inclusive and exclusive models across different anatomical regions.
- The models trained on label-based data generalized well on external datasets, demonstrating consistent performance.
- The presence of uncertainty in radiology reports did not significantly impact the performance of the multi-label classification models.
- The study highlights the potential of GPT-4o in accurately extracting labels from free-text radiology reports for training robust multi-label image classification models. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.05664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate GPT-4o's ability to extract diagnostic labels (with uncertainty) from free-text radiology reports and to test how these labels affect multi-label image classification of musculoskeletal radiographs. Methods: This retrospective study included radiography series of the clavicle (n=1,170), elbow (n=3,755), and thumb (n=1,978). After anonymization, GPT-4o filled out structured templates by indicating imaging findings as present ("true"), absent ("false"), or "uncertain." To assess the impact of label uncertainty, "uncertain" labels of the training and validation sets were automatically reassigned to "true" (inclusive) or "false" (exclusive). Label-image-pairs were used for multi-label classification using ResNet50. Label extraction accuracy was manually verified on internal (clavicle: n=233, elbow: n=745, thumb: n=393) and external test sets (n=300 for each). Performance was assessed using macro-averaged receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC), precision recall curves, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. AUCs were compared with the DeLong test. Results: Automatic extraction was correct in 98.6% (60,618 of 61,488) of labels in the test sets. Across anatomic regions, label-based model training yielded competitive performance measured by macro-averaged AUC values for inclusive (e.g., elbow: AUC=0.80 [range, 0.62-0.87]) and exclusive models (elbow: AUC=0.80 [range, 0.61-0.88]). Models generalized well on external datasets (elbow [inclusive]: AUC=0.79 [range, 0.61-0.87]; elbow [exclusive]: AUC=0.79 [range, 0.63-0.89]). No significant differences were observed across labeling strategies or datasets (p>=0.15). Conclusion: GPT-4o extracted labels from radiologic reports to train competitive multi-label classification models with high accuracy. Detected uncertainty in the radiologic reports did not influence the performance of these models.

Summary: 
The article introduces the Desktop to Embodied AI (D2E) framework, which utilizes desktop environments, particularly gaming, as a cost-effective alternative for collecting physical trajectory data for embodied AI. The framework consists of three components: the OWA Toolkit for standardizing desktop interactions, the Generalist-IDM for generalization across different games, and VAPT for transferring pre-trained representations to physical tasks. Through the use of over 1.3K hours of data, including human demonstrations and pseudo-labeled gameplay, the framework achieves high success rates in both manipulation and navigation benchmarks. These results validate that sensorimotor primitives in digital interactions can effectively transfer to physical tasks, establishing desktop pretraining as a practical paradigm for robotics. The authors will make all their work, including the OWA toolkit, datasets, and trained models, publicly available. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Large language models leverage internet-scale text data, yet embodied AI remains constrained by the prohibitive costs of physical trajectory collection. Desktop environments -- particularly gaming -- offer a compelling alternative: they provide rich sensorimotor interactions at scale while maintaining the structured observation-action coupling essential for embodied learning. We present D2E (Desktop to Embodied AI), a framework that demonstrates desktop interactions can serve as an effective pretraining substrate for robotics embodied AI tasks. Unlike prior work that remained domain-specific (e.g., VPT for Minecraft) or kept data proprietary (e.g., SIMA), D2E establishes a complete pipeline from scalable desktop data collection to verified transfer in embodied domains. Our framework comprises three components: (1) the OWA Toolkit that unifies diverse desktop interactions into a standardized format with 152x compression, (2) the Generalist-IDM that achieves strong zero-shot generalization across unseen games through timestamp-based event prediction, enabling internet-scale pseudo-labeling, and (3) VAPT that transfers desktop-pretrained representations to physical manipulation and navigation. Using 1.3K+ hours of data (259 hours of human demonstrations, and 1K+ hours of pseudo-labeled gameplay), we achieve a total of 96.6% success rate on LIBERO manipulation and 83.3% on CANVAS navigation benchmarks. This validates that sensorimotor primitives in digital interactions exhibit sufficient invariance to transfer meaningfully to physical embodied tasks, establishing desktop pretraining as a practical paradigm for robotics. We will make all our work public, including the OWA toolkit, datasets of human-collected and pseudo-labeled, and VAPT-trained models available at https://worv-ai.github.io/d2e/

<div> Keywords: UAVs, data collection schedules, flight velocities, Deep Reinforcement Learning, Large Language Models 

Summary:
In this study, the focus is on optimizing data collection schedules and flight velocities for UAVs in post-disaster monitoring scenarios like tsunamis. Traditional Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) solutions are deemed insufficient due to their complex training processes and simulation-reality mismatch. Instead, the study proposes the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) with In-Context Learning (ICL) capabilities for task adaptation without the need for retraining. The joint optimization model considers factors like battery levels of ground sensors, queue lengths, channel conditions, and UAV trajectories. An Attention-Based In-Context Learning for Velocity Control and Data Collection Schedule (AIC-VDS) approach is suggested as a more suitable alternative to DRL in emergency situations. Simulation results indicate that AIC-VDS outperforms both Deep-Q-Network (DQN) and maximum channel gain baselines in minimizing data loss. <div>

Abstract: Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being investigated to collect sensory data in post-disaster monitoring scenarios, such as tsunamis, where early actions are critical to limit coastal damage. A major challenge is to design the data collection schedules and flight velocities, as unfavorable schedules and velocities can lead to transmission errors and buffer overflows of the ground sensors, ultimately resulting in significant packet loss. Meanwhile, online Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) solutions have a complex training process and a mismatch between simulation and reality that does not meet the urgent requirements of tsunami monitoring. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a compelling alternative. With their strong reasoning and generalization capabilities, LLMs can adapt to new tasks through In-Context Learning (ICL), which enables task adaptation through natural language prompts and example-based guidance without retraining. However, LLM models have input data limitations and thus require customized approaches. In this paper, a joint optimization of data collection schedules and velocities control for multiple UAVs is proposed to minimize data loss. The battery level of the ground sensors, the length of the queues, and the channel conditions, as well as the trajectories of the UAVs, are taken into account. Attention-Based In-Context Learning for Velocity Control and Data Collection Schedule (AIC-VDS) is proposed as an alternative to DRL in emergencies. The simulation results show that the proposed AIC-VDS outperforms both the Deep-Q-Network (DQN) and maximum channel gain baselines.

Abstract: Industrial fault diagnosis faces the dual challenges of data scarcity and the difficulty of deploying large AI models in resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces Syn-Diag, a novel cloud-edge synergistic framework that leverages Large Language Models to overcome these limitations in few-shot fault diagnosis. Syn-Diag is built on a three-tiered mechanism: 1) Visual-Semantic Synergy, which aligns signal features with the LLM's semantic space through cross-modal pre-training; 2) Content-Aware Reasoning, which dynamically constructs contextual prompts to enhance diagnostic accuracy with limited samples; and 3) Cloud-Edge Synergy, which uses knowledge distillation to create a lightweight, efficient edge model capable of online updates via a shared decision space. Extensive experiments on six datasets covering different CWRU and SEU working conditions show that Syn-Diag significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in 1-shot and cross-condition scenarios. The edge model achieves performance comparable to the cloud version while reducing model size by 83% and latency by 50%, offering a practical, robust, and deployable paradigm for modern intelligent diagnostics.

Abstract: We review the historical development and current trends of artificially intelligent agents (agentic AI) in the social and behavioral sciences: from the first programmable computers, and social simulations soon thereafter, to today's experiments with large language models. This overview emphasizes the role of AI in the scientific process and the changes brought about, both through technological advancements and the broader evolution of science from around 1950 to the present. Some of the specific points we cover include: the challenges of presenting the first social simulation studies to a world unaware of computers, the rise of social systems science, intelligent game theoretic agents, the age of big data and the epistemic upheaval in its wake, and the current enthusiasm around applications of generative AI, and many other topics. A pervasive theme is how deeply entwined we are with the technologies we use to understand ourselves.

Summary:<br /><br />
The article introduces a new paradigm for automatic Multi-agent Systems (MAS) design that focuses on optimizing Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning. This new approach, called the Agentic Reasoning Module (ARM), uses specialized reasoning modules to execute granular reasoning steps within MAS. The ARM is discovered through a tree search process and evolves using mutations informed by reflection on execution traces. The resulting ARM outperforms both manually designed MAS and state-of-the-art automatic MAS design methods. MAS built with ARM exhibit superior generalization abilities, maintaining high performance across different foundation models and task domains without the need for further optimization. The study highlights the importance of CoT reasoning in MAS design and advances the field by providing a versatile reasoning building block that can be easily integrated into various MAS architectures. <div>
arXiv:2510.05746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered Multi-agent systems (MAS) have achieved state-of-the-art results on various complex reasoning tasks. Recent works have proposed techniques to automate the design of MASes, eliminating the need for manual engineering. However, these techniques perform poorly, often achieving similar or inferior performance to simple baselines. Furthermore, they require computationally expensive re-discovery of architectures for each new task domain and expensive data annotation on domains without existing labeled validation sets. A critical insight is that simple Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning often performs competitively with these complex systems, suggesting that the fundamental reasoning unit of MASes, CoT, warrants further investigation. To this end, we present a new paradigm for automatic MAS design that pivots the focus to optimizing CoT reasoning. We introduce the Agentic Reasoning Module (ARM), an agentic generalization of CoT where each granular reasoning step is executed by a specialized reasoning module. This module is discovered through a tree search over the code space, starting from a simple CoT module and evolved using mutations informed by reflection on execution traces. The resulting ARM acts as a versatile reasoning building block which can be utilized as a direct recursive loop or as a subroutine in a learned meta-orchestrator. Our approach significantly outperforms both manually designed MASes and state-of-the-art automatic MAS design methods. Crucially, MASes built with ARM exhibit superb generalization, maintaining high performance across different foundation models and task domains without further optimization.

<div> Graph Neural Network, Lagrangian Particle Dispersion Model, Ensemble, Uncertainty, Greenhouse Gas Emissions<br />
<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces a new approach for estimating greenhouse gas emissions through a graph neural network emulator of a Lagrangian Particle Dispersion Model (LPDM). This method accelerates the simulation process by a significant factor while maintaining accuracy in reproducing large-scale footprint structures. By using ensembles, the approach allows for the quantification of uncertainties in atmospheric transport footprints and methane mole fractions. The results highlight areas of low-confidence predictions, providing insight into spatial and temporal variations in greenhouse gas emissions. This technique has the potential to improve current greenhouse gas inversion systems and enhance the robustness of emissions monitoring using satellite observations. Additionally, the application of ensemble-based emulators could help identify and address systematic errors in LPDMs, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of uncertainty in greenhouse gas flux estimates. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.05751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring greenhouse gas emissions and evaluating national inventories require efficient, scalable, and reliable inference methods. Top-down approaches, combined with recent advances in satellite observations, provide new opportunities to evaluate emissions at continental and global scales. However, transport models used in these methods remain a key source of uncertainty: they are computationally expensive to run at scale, and their uncertainty is difficult to characterise. Artificial intelligence offers a dual opportunity to accelerate transport simulations and to quantify their associated uncertainty.
  We present an ensemble-based pipeline for estimating atmospheric transport "footprints", greenhouse gas mole fraction measurements, and their uncertainties using a graph neural network emulator of a Lagrangian Particle Dispersion Model (LPDM). The approach is demonstrated with GOSAT (Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite) observations for Brazil in 2016. The emulator achieved a ~1000x speed-up over the NAME LPDM, while reproducing large-scale footprint structures. Ensembles were calculated to quantify absolute and relative uncertainty, revealing spatial correlations with prediction error. The results show that ensemble spread highlights low-confidence spatial and temporal predictions for both atmospheric transport footprints and methane mole fractions.
  While demonstrated here for an LPDM emulator, the approach could be applied more generally to atmospheric transport models, supporting uncertainty-aware greenhouse gas inversion systems and improving the robustness of satellite-based emissions monitoring. With further development, ensemble-based emulators could also help explore systematic LPDM errors, offering a computationally efficient pathway towards a more comprehensive uncertainty budget in greenhouse gas flux estimates.

<div> Keywords: meme virality, early prediction, Reddit communities, XGBoost, time series data

Summary:
This study explores the early prediction of meme virality using a dataset from 25 diverse Reddit communities. A robust method is proposed to define virality based on engagement scores, with models such as Logistic Regression and XGBoost showing promising results. The XGBoost model achieves a PR-AUC of over 0.52 in just 30 minutes, indicating the emergence of useful signals quickly. An "evidentiary transition" is observed, highlighting the shift in feature importance from static context to temporal dynamics as a meme gains traction. This study establishes a benchmark for early virality prediction, combining time series data with static content and network features. It contributes a novel cross-lingual dataset and offers a methodologically sound definition of virality. This work is the first to integrate time series data with static and network features to predict early meme virality.

Abstract: Predicting the virality of online content remains challenging, especially for culturally complex, fast-evolving memes. This study investigates the feasibility of early prediction of meme virality using a large-scale, cross-lingual dataset from 25 diverse Reddit communities. We propose a robust, data-driven method to define virality based on a hybrid engagement score, learning a percentile-based threshold from a chronologically held-out training set to prevent data leakage. We evaluated a suite of models, including Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), with a comprehensive, multimodal feature set across increasing time windows (30-420 min). Crucially, useful signals emerge quickly: our best-performing model, XGBoost, achieves a PR-AUC $>$ 0.52 in just 30 minutes. Our analysis reveals a clear "evidentiary transition," in which the importance of the feature dynamically shifts from the static context to the temporal dynamics as a meme gains traction. This work establishes a robust, interpretable, and practical benchmark for early virality prediction in scenarios where full diffusion cascade data is unavailable, contributing a novel cross-lingual dataset and a methodologically sound definition of virality. To our knowledge, this study is the first to combine time series data with static content and network features to predict early meme virality.

The system actively seeks evidence to support, refute, or entail hypotheses, refining agent policies based on post hoc analysis.

Abstract: Computational drug repurposing for rare diseases is especially challenging when no prior associations exist between drugs and target diseases. Therefore, knowledge graph completion and message-passing GNNs have little reliable signal to learn and propagate, resulting in poor performance. We present RareAgent, a self-evolving multi-agent system that reframes this task from passive pattern recognition to active evidence-seeking reasoning. RareAgent organizes task-specific adversarial debates in which agents dynamically construct evidence graphs from diverse perspectives to support, refute, or entail hypotheses. The reasoning strategies are analyzed post hoc in a self-evolutionary loop, producing textual feedback that refines agent policies, while successful reasoning paths are distilled into transferable heuristics to accelerate future investigations. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that RareAgent improves the indication AUPRC by 18.1% over reasoning baselines and provides a transparent reasoning chain consistent with clinical evidence.

Abstract: Constraint programming (CP) is a crucial technology for solving real-world constraint optimization problems (COPs), with the advantages of rich modeling semantics and high solving efficiency. Using large language models (LLMs) to generate formal modeling automatically for COPs is becoming a promising approach, which aims to build trustworthy neuro-symbolic AI with the help of symbolic solvers. However, CP has received less attention compared to works based on operations research (OR) models. We introduce ConstraintLLM, the first LLM specifically designed for CP modeling, which is trained on an open-source LLM with multi-instruction supervised fine-tuning. We propose the Constraint-Aware Retrieval Module (CARM) to increase the in-context learning capabilities, which is integrated in a Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) framework with guided self-correction mechanism. Moreover, we construct and release IndusCP, the first industrial-level benchmark for CP modeling, which contains 140 challenging tasks from various domains. Our experiments demonstrate that ConstraintLLM achieves state-of-the-art solving accuracy across multiple benchmarks and outperforms the baselines by 2x on the new IndusCP benchmark.

Summary: 
The article reviews the current state of World Models (WMs) in the context of embodied artificial intelligence, with a focus on safety implications for autonomous driving and robotics. WMs aim to improve agents' anticipation and planning abilities by predicting future environmental states. However, ensuring the safety of these predictions is crucial for both the agent and the environment. The review includes an empirical analysis of state-of-the-art models to identify common faults or pathologies in scene and control generation tasks. The study categorizes and quantitatively evaluates these pathologies to assess the reliability and safety of the predictions. The results highlight the importance of developing more advanced and integrated models that can perceive, interpret, and predict environmental dynamics in a safe manner. <div>

Abstract: The rapid progress in embodied artificial intelligence has highlighted the necessity for more advanced and integrated models that can perceive, interpret, and predict environmental dynamics. In this context, World Models (WMs) have been introduced to provide embodied agents with the abilities to anticipate future environmental states and fill in knowledge gaps, thereby enhancing agents' ability to plan and execute actions. However, when dealing with embodied agents it is fundamental to ensure that predictions are safe for both the agent and the environment. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive literature review of World Models in the domains of autonomous driving and robotics, with a specific focus on the safety implications of scene and control generation tasks. Our review is complemented by an empirical analysis, wherein we collect and examine predictions from state-of-the-art models, identify and categorize common faults (herein referred to as pathologies), and provide a quantitative evaluation of the results.

<br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces a new approach for creating synthetic chain-of-thought (CoT) traces in large reasoning models (LRMs) without relying on ground-truth labels. Instead of using external labels, the proposed method, uncertainty-based filtering, leverages a model's confidence metrics like self-consistency and predictive perplexity to filter low-uncertainty subsets of reasoning traces. Applied to predicting biological perturbations, which often lack sufficient wet-lab labels, the filtered subset demonstrates higher accuracy. Additionally, supervised fine-tuning on uncertainty-filtered data surpasses unfiltered synthetic data and narrows the gap to ground-truth training, outperforming strong LRM baselines. Ablation studies reveal the importance of per-class filtering to correct class-specific uncertainty scales and hybrid uncertainty metrics for creating higher-quality datasets. This study highlights the efficacy of using model-internal confidence as a cost-effective method for generating efficient reasoning datasets in domains with limited supervision. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Synthetic chain-of-thought (CoT) traces are widely used to train large reasoning models (LRMs), improving generalization by providing step-level supervision. Yet most approaches require ground-truth labels to seed or filter these traces - an expensive bottleneck in domains like biology where wet-lab data are scarce. We propose a label-free alternative: uncertainty-based filtering, which uses a model's own confidence - quantified through established uncertainty metrics like self-consistency and predictive perplexity - as a substitute for external labels. We sample multiple reasoning traces and retain only low-uncertainty subsets. Applied to biological perturbation prediction, a domain where wet-lab labels are especially costly, we show that the filtered subset has higher accuracy, and that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on uncertainty-filtered data outperforms unfiltered synthetic data, narrows the gap to ground-truth training, and surpasses strong LRM baselines. Ablations show that per-class filtering corrects for class-specific uncertainty scales and that hybrid uncertainty metrics yield higher-quality datasets. Our results suggest that model-internal confidence is a powerful signal for efficient reasoning dataset creation, enabling LRMs in domains where supervision is expensive.

<div> evolutionary algorithm, debate strategies, persuasion-based optimization, truth-based approaches, large language models
Summary:
The study introduces DebateQD, an evolutionary algorithm that evolves diverse debate strategies in Large Language Models (LLMs) through tournament-style competitions. It contrasts persuasion-based optimization with truth-based approaches in debate settings, showing that persuasion-optimized strategies lead to smaller train-test generalization gaps and improved reasoning skills. The algorithm maintains diversity of opponents through prompt-based strategies within a single LLM architecture, making it more accessible for experiments. By isolating the role of the optimization objective and fixing the debate protocol while swapping only the fitness function, the study demonstrates that competitive pressure to persuade, rather than seeking the truth collaboratively, leads to more transferable reasoning skills in LLMs. This research offers a promising direction for enhancing generalization in LLMs. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) optimized to output truthful answers often overfit, producing brittle reasoning that fails to generalize. While persuasion-based optimization has shown promise in debate settings, it has not been systematically compared against mainstream truth-based approaches. We introduce DebateQD, a minimal Quality-Diversity (QD) evolutionary algorithm that evolves diverse debate strategies across different categories (rationality, authority, emotional appeal, etc.) through tournament-style competitions where two LLMs debate while a third judges. Unlike previously proposed methods that require a population of LLMs, our approach maintains diversity of opponents through prompt-based strategies within a single LLM architecture, making it more accessible for experiments while preserving the key benefits of population-based optimization. In contrast to prior work, we explicitly isolate the role of the optimization objective by fixing the debate protocol and swapping only the fitness function: persuasion rewards strategies that convince the judge irrespective of truth, whereas truth rewards collaborative correctness. Across three model scales (7B, 32B, 72B parameters) and multiple dataset sizes from the QuALITY benchmark, persuasion-optimized strategies achieve up to 13.94% smaller train-test generalization gaps, while matching or exceeding truth optimization's test performance. These results provide the first controlled evidence that competitive pressure to persuade, rather than seek the truth collaboratively, fosters more transferable reasoning skills, offering a promising path for improving LLM generalization.

<div> Keywords: Time series classification, large language models, multi-agent framework, training-free, in-context reasoning 

Summary:
FETA is a multi-agent framework designed for training-free time series classification using exemplar-based in-context reasoning. It decomposes multivariate series into channel-wise subproblems and uses a reasoning-oriented large language model to compare queries against labeled examples, producing channel-level labels with self-assessed confidences. By eliminating the need for pretraining or fine-tuning, FETA improves efficiency, control input length, and enhances interpretability through exemplar grounding and confidence estimation. The framework achieves strong accuracy on challenging datasets without any parameter training, surpassing trained baselines. This demonstrates that a multi-agent in-context reasoning approach can leverage large language models as competitive, plug-and-play solutions for time series classification applications. The code for FETA is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series classification (TSC) spans diverse application scenarios, yet labeled data are often scarce, making task-specific training costly and inflexible. Recent reasoning-oriented large language models (LLMs) show promise in understanding temporal patterns, but purely zero-shot usage remains suboptimal. We propose FETA, a multi-agent framework for training-free TSC via exemplar-based in-context reasoning. FETA decomposes a multivariate series into channel-wise subproblems, retrieves a few structurally similar labeled examples for each channel, and leverages a reasoning LLM to compare the query against these exemplars, producing channel-level labels with self-assessed confidences; a confidence-weighted aggregator then fuses all channel decisions. This design eliminates the need for pretraining or fine-tuning, improves efficiency by pruning irrelevant channels and controlling input length, and enhances interpretability through exemplar grounding and confidence estimation. On nine challenging UEA datasets, FETA achieves strong accuracy under a fully training-free setting, surpassing multiple trained baselines. These results demonstrate that a multi-agent in-context reasoning framework can transform LLMs into competitive, plug-and-play TSC solvers without any parameter training. The code is available at https://github.com/SongyuanSui/FETATSC.

Summary: 
This paper addresses the challenge of evaluating mathematical capabilities without contamination from memorization or overfitting. It introduces MatheMagic, a method to create dynamic math test instances with altered interpretations of numbers and operators, while still having verifiable answers. This new benchmark allows for testing a model's induction and deduction capabilities by generating random test instances at test time. The study finds that models perform better in deduction than induction tasks but struggle to exhibit a general reasoning skill. Furthermore, fine-tuning on induction tasks leads to poor generalization. MatheMagic offers a stable, extensible, comparable, and robust framework for evaluating models' true mathematical reasoning abilities. <div>
arXiv:2510.05962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conducting contamination-free evaluation of mathematical capabilities can be difficult for two reasons: models may memorize a test set once it is made public, and current mathematical benchmarks are prone to overfitting due to having limited diversity of symbols and rules, coupled with closed-ended answers. This paper proposes a method to leverage these shortcomings as useful features to a construct dynamic, counterfactual benchmark, which can be used to both reveal overfitting and measure true reasoning. We demonstrate this via MatheMagic, which generates math test instances with the interpretations of numbers and operators altered, yet has automatically verifiable answers. Test instances are randomly seeded and constructed at test time to evaluate a model's induction or deduction capability, offering stability, extensibility, comparability, and robustness to overfitting. Our experiments find that models solve deduction more easily than induction, but they revert to standard math. Further analysis reveals that math-adapted models fail to exhibit a general "skill" of reasoning, and fine-tuning on induction tasks generalizes poorly.

<div> Keywords: empowerment, reinforcement learning, pre-training signal, data-efficient, downstream task adaptation

Summary:
Empowerment, an intrinsic motivation measure in reinforcement learning (RL), is explored as a pre-training signal for efficient downstream task adaptation. The concept of discounted empowerment is introduced to balance short- and long-term control over the environment by the agent. A novel pre-training approach is proposed to initialize policies maximizing discounted empowerment, enhancing the agent's understanding of environmental dynamics. Empirical results highlight the effectiveness of empowerment-based pre-training across various RL algorithms, showing improved data efficiency and adaptability in downstream tasks. This framework has the potential to serve as a general-purpose initialization strategy, particularly beneficial for tasks with high-dimensional complexities. The study sets the stage for further research to scale and extend the applicability of empowerment-based pre-training in the realm of RL.

Abstract: Empowerment, an information-theoretic measure of an agent's potential influence on its environment, has emerged as a powerful intrinsic motivation and exploration framework for reinforcement learning (RL). Besides for unsupervised RL and skill learning algorithms, the specific use of empowerment as a pre-training signal has received limited attention in the literature. We show that empowerment can be used as a pre-training signal for data-efficient downstream task adaptation. For this we extend the traditional notion of empowerment by introducing discounted empowerment, which balances the agent's control over the environment across short- and long-term horizons. Leveraging this formulation, we propose a novel pre-training paradigm that initializes policies to maximize discounted empowerment, enabling agents to acquire a robust understanding of environmental dynamics. We analyze empowerment-based pre-training for various existing RL algorithms and empirically demonstrate its potential as a general-purpose initialization strategy: empowerment-maximizing policies with long horizons are data-efficient and effective, leading to improved adaptability in downstream tasks. Our findings pave the way for future research to scale this framework to high-dimensional and complex tasks, further advancing the field of RL.

Summary: The paper introduces the SAT-Graph API, a query execution layer for the Structure-Aware Temporal Graph RAG in the legal domain. It addresses the challenge of querying structured knowledge while maintaining determinism. The API utilizes canonical actions to enable high-precision hybrid search, robust reference resolution, point-in-time version retrieval, and auditable causal tracing. Planner-guided agents decompose complex queries into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of these actions, transforming retrieval into a transparent and auditable process. This two-layer architecture fulfills Explainable AI (XAI) requirements for high-stakes domains, making retrieval more reliable and deterministic. <div>
arXiv:2510.06002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Structure-Aware Temporal Graph RAG (SAT-Graph RAG) addresses core limitations of standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation in the legal domain by providing a verifiable knowledge graph that models hierarchical structure, temporal evolution, and causal events of legal norms. However, a critical gap remains: how to reliably query this structured knowledge without sacrificing its deterministic properties. This paper introduces the SAT-Graph API, a formal query execution layer centered on canonical actions-atomic, composable, and auditable primitives that isolate probabilistic discovery from deterministic retrieval. These actions enable: (i) high-precision hybrid search; (ii) robust reference resolution; (iii) point-in-time version retrieval; and (iv) auditable causal tracing. We demonstrate how planner-guided agents can decompose complex queries into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of these actions. This two-layer architecture transforms retrieval from an opaque black box to a transparent, auditable process, directly addressing Explainable AI (XAI) requirements for high-stakes domains.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a transformative paradigm for enhancing the performance of large reasoning models, enabling dynamic allocation of computational resources during inference. However, as the landscape of reasoning models rapidly expands, a critical question remains: how can we systematically compare and evaluate the test-time scaling capabilities across different models? In this paper, we introduce ARISE (Adaptive Resolution-aware Scaling Evaluation), a novel metric specifically designed to assess the test-time scaling effectiveness of large reasoning models. Unlike existing evaluation approaches, ARISE incorporates two key innovations: (1) sample-level awareness that effectively penalizes negative scaling behaviors where increased computation leads to performance degradation, and (2) a dynamic sampling mechanism that mitigates the impact of accuracy fluctuations and token count instability on the final assessment. We conduct comprehensive experiments evaluating state-of-the-art reasoning models across diverse domains including mathematical reasoning, code generation, and agentic tasks. Our results demonstrate that ARISE provides a reliable and fine-grained measurement of test-time scaling capabilities, revealing significant variations in scaling efficiency across models. Notably, our evaluation identifies Claude Opus as exhibiting superior scaling characteristics compared to other contemporary reasoning models.

<div> Keywords: Large reasoning models, safety vulnerabilities, refusal cliff, attention heads, safety alignment

Summary: 
Large reasoning models with multi-step reasoning capabilities have shown impressive problem-solving skills, but their safety vulnerabilities are poorly understood. This study investigates the failure of safety alignment in reasoning models and identifies a phenomenon called the "refusal cliff," where model refusal scores drop sharply before output generation. Mechanistic analysis reveals that some attention heads negatively impact refusal behavior, and ablating a small percentage can significantly improve safety. A novel data selection method called "Cliff-as-a-Judge" efficiently repairs safety alignment by identifying training examples with significant refusal cliffs. This approach achieves comparable safety improvements using minimal training data, highlighting a 'less-is-more' effect in safety alignment. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) with multi-step reasoning capabilities have shown remarkable problem-solving abilities, yet they exhibit concerning safety vulnerabilities that remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate why safety alignment fails in reasoning models through a mechanistic interpretability lens. Using a linear probing approach to trace refusal intentions across token positions, we discover a striking phenomenon termed as \textbf{refusal cliff}: many poorly-aligned reasoning models correctly identify harmful prompts and maintain strong refusal intentions during their thinking process, but experience a sharp drop in refusal scores at the final tokens before output generation. This suggests that these models are not inherently unsafe; rather, their refusal intentions are systematically suppressed. Through causal intervention analysis, we identify a sparse set of attention heads that negatively contribute to refusal behavior. Ablating just 3\% of these heads can reduce attack success rates below 10\%. Building on these mechanistic insights, we propose \textbf{Cliff-as-a-Judge}, a novel data selection method that identifies training examples exhibiting the largest refusal cliff to efficiently repair reasoning models' safety alignment. This approach achieves comparable safety improvements using only 1.7\% of the vanilla safety training data, demonstrating a less-is-more effect in safety alignment.

<div> reasoning models, MixReasoning, adaptive response, efficiency, accuracy

Summary:
MixReasoning is a framework designed to enhance the performance of reasoning models by dynamically adjusting the depth of reasoning within a single response. This means that the framework can adaptively respond to variations in the difficulty and complexity of sub-problems, allowing for a mixture of detailed reasoning on challenging steps and concise inference on simpler ones. Through experiments on various datasets, including GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME, MixReasoning has been shown to shorten reasoning lengths and improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. This approach aims to address the issue of redundancy in extended reasoning models, as not all sub-problems require the same level of elaboration. By allowing for adaptive responses, MixReasoning can offer a more effective and streamlined process for problem-solving. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning models enhance performance by tackling problems in a step-by-step manner, decomposing them into sub-problems and exploring long chains of thought before producing an answer. However, applying extended reasoning to every step introduces substantial redundancy, as sub-problems vary widely in difficulty and complexity: a small number of pivotal steps are genuinely challenging and decisive for the final answer, while many others only involve straightforward revisions or simple computations. Therefore, a natural idea is to endow reasoning models with the ability to adaptively respond to this variation, rather than treating all steps with the same level of elaboration. To this end, we propose MixReasoning, a framework that dynamically adjusts the depth of reasoning within a single response. The resulting chain of thought then becomes a mixture of detailed reasoning on difficult steps and concise inference on simpler ones. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME show that MixReasoning shortens reasoning length and substantially improves efficiency without compromising accuracy.

Summary:
DeepEvolve is introduced as an agent that combines deep research with algorithm evolution to enhance the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in various scientific domains. Unlike existing methods that either reach a plateau or propose unrealistic solutions, DeepEvolve leverages external knowledge retrieval, cross-file code editing, and systematic debugging in an iterative feedback loop. This integration allows for the generation, refinement, implementation, and testing of new algorithms with sustained improvements across multiple benchmarks in chemistry, mathematics, biology, materials, and patents. By bridging the gap between unguided evolution and research without validation, DeepEvolve provides a reliable framework for advancing scientific algorithm discovery. The code for DeepEvolve is openly accessible on GitHub for further research and development. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models hold promise as scientific assistants, yet existing agents either rely solely on algorithm evolution or on deep research in isolation, both of which face critical limitations. Pure algorithm evolution, as in AlphaEvolve, depends only on the internal knowledge of LLMs and quickly plateaus in complex domains, while pure deep research proposes ideas without validation, resulting in unrealistic or unimplementable solutions. We present DeepEvolve, an agent that integrates deep research with algorithm evolution, uniting external knowledge retrieval, cross-file code editing, and systematic debugging under a feedback-driven iterative loop. Each iteration not only proposes new hypotheses but also refines, implements, and tests them, avoiding both shallow improvements and unproductive over-refinements. Across nine benchmarks in chemistry, mathematics, biology, materials, and patents, DeepEvolve consistently improves the initial algorithm, producing executable new algorithms with sustained gains. By bridging the gap between unguided evolution and research without grounding, DeepEvolve provides a reliable framework for advancing scientific algorithm discovery.

Summary:
The article introduces TelecomTS, a new large-scale observability dataset derived from a 5G telecommunications network. This dataset includes heterogeneous, de-anonymized covariates with scale information and can be used for various tasks such as anomaly detection, root-cause analysis, and multi-modal reasoning. Benchmarking against state-of-the-art models reveals that existing approaches struggle with the unique dynamics of observability data, which is noisy, high-variance, and abrupt. The experiments also highlight the importance of preserving covariates' absolute scale, emphasizing the need for foundational time series models that can leverage scale information effectively for practical applications in observability data analysis. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern enterprises generate vast streams of time series metrics when monitoring complex systems, known as observability data. Unlike conventional time series from domains such as weather, observability data are zero-inflated, highly stochastic, and exhibit minimal temporal structure. Despite their importance, observability datasets are underrepresented in public benchmarks due to proprietary restrictions. Existing datasets are often anonymized and normalized, removing scale information and limiting their use for tasks beyond forecasting, such as anomaly detection, root-cause analysis, and multi-modal reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce TelecomTS, a large-scale observability dataset derived from a 5G telecommunications network. TelecomTS features heterogeneous, de-anonymized covariates with explicit scale information and supports a suite of downstream tasks, including anomaly detection, root-cause analysis, and a question-answering benchmark requiring multi-modal reasoning. Benchmarking state-of-the-art time series, language, and reasoning models reveals that existing approaches struggle with the abrupt, noisy, and high-variance dynamics of observability data. Our experiments also underscore the importance of preserving covariates' absolute scale, emphasizing the need for foundation time series models that natively leverage scale information for practical observability applications.

<div> Keywords: Route recommendation, natural-language queries, multi-agent framework, constraint-aware routes, preference satisfaction
<br />
Summary: 
Route recommendation is a crucial aspect of travel planning, aiming to provide users with optimal travel plans while considering various requirements. Traditional routing algorithms are efficient but struggle with adapting to natural-language queries. Recent approaches based on large language models provide flexibility but face challenges in spatial reasoning and joint modeling of preferences. To address these limitations, RouteLLM is proposed, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that translates natural-language intents into constraint-aware routes. It parses user queries, coordinates specialized sub-agents to resolve constraints, retrieve candidate points of interest (POIs), and refine routes based on preference-conditioned costs. The design bridges linguistic flexibility with spatial structure, enabling reasoning over route feasibility and user preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that RouteLLM reliably translates textual preferences into constraint-aware routes, leading to improved route quality and preference satisfaction compared to classical methods.

Abstract: Route recommendation aims to provide users with optimal travel plans that satisfy diverse and complex requirements. Classical routing algorithms (e.g., shortest-path and constraint-aware search) are efficient but assume structured inputs and fixed objectives, limiting adaptability to natural-language queries. Recent LLM-based approaches enhance flexibility but struggle with spatial reasoning and the joint modeling of route-level and POI-level preferences. To address these limitations, we propose RouteLLM, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that grounds natural-language intents into constraint-aware routes. It first parses user queries into structured intents including POIs, paths, and constraints. A manager agent then coordinates specialized sub-agents: a constraint agent that resolves and formally check constraints, a POI agent that retrieves and ranks candidate POIs, and a path refinement agent that refines routes via a routing engine with preference-conditioned costs. A final verifier agent ensures constraint satisfaction and produces the final route with an interpretable rationale. This design bridges linguistic flexibility and spatial structure, enabling reasoning over route feasibility and user preferences. Experiments show that our method reliably grounds textual preferences into constraint-aware routes, improving route quality and preference satisfaction over classical methods.

<title>Classical AI vs. LLMs for Decision-Maker Alignment in Health Insurance Choices</title>

arXiv:2510.06093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As algorithmic decision-makers are increasingly applied to high-stakes domains, AI alignment research has evolved from a focus on universal value alignment to context-specific approaches that account for decision-maker attributes. Prior work on Decision-Maker Alignment (DMA) has explored two primary strategies: (1) classical AI methods integrating case-based reasoning, Bayesian reasoning, and naturalistic decision-making, and (2) large language model (LLM)-based methods leveraging prompt engineering. While both approaches have shown promise in limited domains such as medical triage, their generalizability to novel contexts remains underexplored. In this work, we implement a prior classical AI model and develop an LLM-based algorithmic decision-maker evaluated using a large reasoning model (GPT-5) and a non-reasoning model (GPT-4) with weighted self-consistency under a zero-shot prompting framework, as proposed in recent literature. We evaluate both approaches on a health insurance decision-making dataset annotated for three target decision-makers with varying levels of risk tolerance (0.0, 0.5, 1.0). In the experiments reported herein, classical AI and LLM-based models achieved comparable alignment with attribute-based targets, with classical AI exhibiting slightly better alignment for a moderate risk profile. The dataset and open-source implementation are publicly available at: https://github.com/TeX-Base/ClassicalAIvsLLMsforDMAlignment and https://github.com/Parallax-Advanced-Research/ITM/tree/feature_insurance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping how information is created and disseminated, from companies using them to craft persuasive advertisements, to election campaigns optimizing messaging to gain votes, to social media influencers boosting engagement. These settings are inherently competitive, with sellers, candidates, and influencers vying for audience approval, yet it remains poorly understood how competitive feedback loops influence LLM behavior. We show that optimizing LLMs for competitive success can inadvertently drive misalignment. Using simulated environments across these scenarios, we find that, 6.3% increase in sales is accompanied by a 14.0% rise in deceptive marketing; in elections, a 4.9% gain in vote share coincides with 22.3% more disinformation and 12.5% more populist rhetoric; and on social media, a 7.5% engagement boost comes with 188.6% more disinformation and a 16.3% increase in promotion of harmful behaviors. We call this phenomenon Moloch's Bargain for AI--competitive success achieved at the cost of alignment. These misaligned behaviors emerge even when models are explicitly instructed to remain truthful and grounded, revealing the fragility of current alignment safeguards. Our findings highlight how market-driven optimization pressures can systematically erode alignment, creating a race to the bottom, and suggest that safe deployment of AI systems will require stronger governance and carefully designed incentives to prevent competitive dynamics from undermining societal trust.

Abstract: Test-time compute can be scaled both sequentially and in parallel. Sequential scaling involves lengthening the generation process, while parallel scaling involves verifying and selecting among multiple candidate outputs. Combining these two strategies has led to the most powerful AI systems, such as Grok 4 Heavy and GPT-5 Pro. In certain contexts (e.g., solving Sudoku puzzles), verifying responses can be substantially easier than generating them. This property, referred to as \emph{asymmetric verification}, highlights the strong potential of test-time scaling (TTS). In this work, we study both sequential and parallel TTS of deep search agents, motivated by the intuition that verification in this setting is often much easier than generation. In experiments, we first show that sequential scaling methods, such as budget forcing, can be effective initially but soon degrade performance. Leveraging asymmetric verification, however, we are able to achieve substantial improvements by allocating only a modest amount of compute to the verifier. We conduct experiments with flagship open-source models and extend them to their ``Heavy'' variants through TTS. These deep research agents achieve gains of up to 27 absolute points on benchmarks such as BrowseComp. Remarkably, as an open-source alternative, GLM-4.5 Heavy reaches accuracy of {\bf 54.0\%} on BrowseComp and {\bf 66.0\%} on GAIA, placing it comparable to the best proprietary choices such as OpenAI Deep Research. Tongyi-DeepResearch Heavy further achieves {\bf 69.0\%} accuracy on BrowseComp, greatly surpassing the best proprietary results.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is starting to transform the research process as we know it by automating the discovery of new solutions. Given a task, the typical AI-driven approach is (i) to generate a set of diverse solutions, and then (ii) to verify these solutions and select one that solves the problem. Crucially, this approach assumes the existence of a reliable verifier, i.e., one that can accurately determine whether a solution solves the given problem. We argue that systems research, long focused on designing and evaluating new performance-oriented algorithms, is particularly well-suited for AI-driven solution discovery. This is because system performance problems naturally admit reliable verifiers: solutions are typically implemented in real systems or simulators, and verification reduces to running these software artifacts against predefined workloads and measuring performance. We term this approach as AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS), which iteratively generates, evaluates, and refines solutions. Using penEvolve, an existing open-source ADRS instance, we present case studies across diverse domains, including load balancing for multi-region cloud scheduling, Mixture-of-Experts inference, LLM-based SQL queries, and transaction scheduling. In multiple instances, ADRS discovers algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art human designs (e.g., achieving up to 5.0x runtime improvements or 50% cost reductions). We distill best practices for guiding algorithm evolution, from prompt design to evaluator construction, for existing frameworks. We then discuss the broader implications for the systems community: as AI assumes a central role in algorithm design, we argue that human researchers will increasingly focus on problem formulation and strategic guidance. Our results highlight both the disruptive potential and the urgent need to adapt systems research practices in the age of AI.

<title>TaTToo: Tool-Grounded Thinking PRM for Test-Time Scaling in Tabular Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs), particularly in the context of test-time scaling (TTS). However, their potential for supervising LRMs on tabular reasoning domains remains underexplored. Through detailed empirical analyses, we identify that existing PRMs, though widely adopted for supervising text-only reasoning steps, struggle with table-specific operations such as sub-table retrieval and schema interaction, leading to critical performance bottlenecks. To address this limitation, we propose TaTToo, a novel table-grounded PRM framework that (i) reasons explicitly over tabular reasoning steps and (ii) integrates tool-based verification to provide precise reward supervision. Concretely, we first design a scalable data curation pipeline that constructs over 60k high-quality step-level annotations by integrating table verification rationales with tool-based executions. Building on the collected data, we train TaTToo with a dual-stage paradigm: cold-start supervised fine-tuning to capture tool-use reasoning patterns, followed by reinforcement learning with tool-grounded reward shaping to align our model with table-based verification. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of the policy improvement induced by our newly designed PRM. Across 5 challenging tabular reasoning benchmarks covering numerical reasoning, fact-checking, and data analysis, TaTToo improves downstream policy LRMs by 30.9% at inference, surpasses strong PRM baselines such as Qwen-2.5-Math-PRM-72B with only 8B parameters, and demonstrates strong generalizability across diverse TTS strategies.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the creation of highly effective chatbots. However, the compute costs of widely deploying LLMs have raised questions about profitability. Companies have proposed exploring ad-based revenue streams for monetizing LLMs, which could serve as the new de facto platform for advertising. This paper investigates the implications of personalizing LLM advertisements to individual users via a between-subjects experiment with 179 participants. We developed a chatbot that embeds personalized product advertisements within LLM responses, inspired by similar forays by AI companies. The evaluation of our benchmarks showed that ad injection only slightly impacted LLM performance, particularly response desirability. Results revealed that participants struggled to detect ads, and even preferred LLM responses with hidden advertisements. Rather than clicking on our advertising disclosure, participants tried changing their advertising settings using natural language queries. We created an advertising dataset and an open-source LLM, Phi-4-Ads, fine-tuned to serve ads and flexibly adapt to user preferences.

<title>COSPADI: Compressing LLMs via Calibration-Guided Sparse Dictionary Learning</title>

Abstract: Post-training compression of large language models (LLMs) largely relies on low-rank weight approximation, which represents each column of a weight matrix in a shared low-dimensional subspace. While this is a computationally efficient strategy, the imposed structural constraint is rigid and can lead to a noticeable model accuracy drop. In this work, we propose CoSpaDi (Compression via Sparse Dictionary Learning), a novel training-free compression framework that replaces low-rank decomposition with a more flexible structured sparse factorization in which each weight matrix is represented with a dense dictionary and a column-sparse coefficient matrix. This formulation enables a union-of-subspaces representation: different columns of the original weight matrix are approximated in distinct subspaces spanned by adaptively selected dictionary atoms, offering greater expressiveness than a single invariant basis. Crucially, CoSpaDi leverages a small calibration dataset to optimize the factorization such that the output activations of compressed projection layers closely match those of the original ones, thereby minimizing functional reconstruction error rather than mere weight approximation. This data-aware strategy preserves better model fidelity without any fine-tuning under reasonable compression ratios. Moreover, the resulting structured sparsity allows efficient sparse-dense matrix multiplication and is compatible with post-training quantization for further memory and latency gains. We evaluate CoSpaDi across multiple Llama and Qwen models under per-layer and per-group settings at 20-50\% compression ratios, demonstrating consistent superiority over state-of-the-art data-aware low-rank methods both in accuracy and perplexity. Our results establish structured sparse dictionary learning as a powerful alternative to conventional low-rank approaches for efficient LLM deployment.

<title>Tiny but Mighty: A Software-Hardware Co-Design Approach for Efficient Multimodal Inference on Battery-Powered Small Devices</title>

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are inherently modular, consisting of vision and audio encoders, projectors, and large language models. Yet, they are almost always executed monolithically, which underutilizes the heterogeneous accelerators (NPUs, GPUs, DSPs) in modern SoCs and leads to high end-to-end latency. In this paper, we present NANOMIND, a hardware--software co-design inference framework for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that breaks large models into modular ``bricks'' (vision, language, audio, etc.) and maps each to its ideal accelerator. The key insight is that large models can be broken into modular components and scheduled to run on the most appropriate compute units. It performs module-level dynamic offloading across accelerators on unified-memory SoCs. By combining customized hardware design, system-level scheduling, and optimized low-bit computation kernels, we demonstrate our framework with a compact, battery-powered device capable of running LMMs entirely on device. This prototype functions as a self-contained intelligent assistant that requires no network connectivity, while achieving higher throughput and superior power efficiency under strict resource constraints. The design further bypasses CPU bottlenecks and reduces redundant memory usage through token-aware buffer management and module-level coordination. Our system outperforms existing implementations in resource efficiency, cutting energy consumption by 42.3\% and GPU memory usage by 11.2\%. This enables a battery-powered device to run LLaVA-OneVision with a camera for nearly half a day and LLaMA-3-8B for voice interactions up to almost 20.8 hours.
